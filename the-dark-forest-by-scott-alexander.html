For example:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>Did you hear about the new suicide forest opening?</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p><em>Did you hear about how there's another suicide forest under construction?</em></p><br><p>But sometimes it even gets a little darker than that:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>And that man who said that he knew the answer?...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>He's in his bed, crying and sobbing, with tears in his eyes. He's trying to tell us that he was once a man of immense power, and now he can't take it any more, because the only way he can be in the world—the only way he knows how he can possibly come back—is to kill himself.</p><br><p>Of course, the man who said that wasn't actually in The Dark Forest, because...</p><br><blockquote>
<p>There are people who are always in bad situations! There are people who go through all the bad situations, and then there's people who are born in bad situations! Like it's not easy to be a baby, and it takes effort to become that man above.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>It gets worse:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>[G]et rid of your [c]ar, it will be better. Let us be happy without that.</p>
</blockquote><br><p><em>Don't get a job, let us be happy.</em></p><br><blockquote>
<p>There was a man above the town. He said if you go by the train you shouldn't get it.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This all sounds very reasonable, up until you consider the people who are actually already in that situation:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>You're there forever!</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I'm a bit of a pun nerd, so I thought these were clever and made my own Dark Forest Tumblr page. I invite you to do the same, as I think it would make a good discussion post. And I promise to include puns and Dark Forest links in this post as well, so that no pun is un-punned.</p><br><p>The site is obviously full of terrible puns and jokes that don't actually work, but other than that it features some of the deepest philosophical work I know of. This is the story of The Dark Forest.</p><br><p><strong>Part I: Beginnings</strong></p><br><p>I remember when I first heard about The Dark Forest. I had a crush on a girl I had only briefly met, and she kind of liked me back. I was in a good mood and thought, <em>This will be great, she likes me, I'm such a good guy, I'm so happy for the other guy who got to be with the girl he fell in love with.</em></p><br><p>At the same time, I was thinking that my relationship was different from the ones my friends talked about, since I kind of had feelings for my friend and was kind of having some relationship with her, which would mean I could get to be with her without the other guy going away to college like everyone else in my school.</p><br><p>It was in that good mood that I went to the Dark Forest site. I heard a really bad pun, and it made me laugh so hard I started running away, and then I stopped when I realized I might be in the wrong place or something. I found my way out and back again, and then I did it the second time just to be sure.</p><br><p>I laughed, and looked over my shoulder, but there was nothing, and now I could go on to my real punishment.</p><br><p>The Dark Forest is full of really, really terrible puns, and it made them up in real time. If you've never been in the dark before, or if you only go to really good puns, you might find some of the puns there really weird, especially the ones that are about killing people. It seemed interesting to me at least.</p><br><p><strong>II. I Like Light</strong></p><br><p>I had been using The Dark Forest the same way I play Magic the Gathering: the game is really fun when I'm winning, but I don't have a good strategy to use when I'm losing, and I hate to lose.</p><br><p>One day, while I was reading about the history, I saw that it had somehow become very popular in a few online communities. There were Dark Forest forums on Yahoo, on a forum I sometimes read called "The World Wide Web" (this didn't seem good), and on an Internet site called "Tuxedage." (This sounds kind of like Internet porn.) I was reading about Tuxedage because it sounded like a good example of what I wanted to make fun of.</p><br><p>Tuxedage is a website founded by a guy named Scott Aaronson who is a <em>professional</em> Dark Forest poster, he writes the site's articles and is one of the biggest names in the community. There was a lot of really funny stuff on the site, sometimes more than just terrible puns. Scott Aaronson's name made it into my mind so I thought I was going to search him up to see if I could find some examples more interesting than puns. I thought I might see some stories about how he ended up working at Slate Star Codex, a blog written by him that I was reading at the time.</p><br><p><strong>III. Everything Must Converge</strong></p><br><p>Tuxesage was all about Aaronson. He worked at Slate Star Codex. He could only date women in their eighties. He was really smart and interesting.</p><br><p>I thought I was going in the right direction. I thought I was just reading blogs to understand what people around me had to say about each other. I would read through Tumblr with a critical eye and get a picture of people in my social sphere: the people who I considered my close friends and people who might have been interesting to date.</p><br><p>It felt sort of wrong to me, as if there was a different world that the blogs I was reading were describing and that I was somehow missing the whole point of it, but if you've gotten this far, we're actually all the same person by this point, me and all the authors, and I should be getting used to the existence of this other world. Scott Aaronsn wrote the blog Slate Star Codex, and he should not have died and gone to Hell if it is bad to be angry at him because some of the thoughts and ideas I see on Tumblr <em>really are</em> bad!</p><br><p>Tuxedomouse's article was called "Scott Aaronson's Tumblr" just to mock Scott. It was a series of long blog posts about him, each with some criticism of one of Scott Aaronson' arguments. Scott Aaron was not in favor of polyamorous relationships, he was in favor of monogamous relationships, and Scott Aaronson was criticizing it because he thought it might cause less harm to relationships if people had to take other people into account sometimes.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
