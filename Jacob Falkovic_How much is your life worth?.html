By and large, this is true. One would probably be hard-pressed to name even five bad experiences in life, let alone five events that stand out. And all of these events are good:</p><br><ul>
<li>Being born.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Meeting your wife and having children.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Starting at least one successful enterprise.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Learning how to dance.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Tying an interesting pair of shoes.</li>
</ul><br><p>On the other hand, here are twenty-five good or really good moments in one's life:</p><br><ul>
<li>Going through medical school and becoming a doctor.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Getting to know your girlfriend.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Seeing your friends on a weekend trip.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Starting your own romantic relationship that lasts for years.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Helping a friend move into their own apartment.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Leaving your job as a software engineer.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Finding someone great on a date.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Going to events like the LessWrong and rationality meetups.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Making several new friends. On average, this takes about a month of steady communication.</li>
</ul><br><p>There are also some things that I would not recommend doing:</p><br><ul>
<li>Running in the morning.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Crying too much.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Riding on public transit at night.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Writing essays on Twitter.</li>
</ul><br><p>These may be less enjoyable for some people (because running on public transit in night sounds horrible and not fun at all), or perhaps more people want to do them than I'd think (in which case I'm happy that I'm not doing all of them). That said, if you have some way of doing these actions while enjoying the experience, that's awesome and I'm happy that you're already doing half of these things!</p><br><p>So: how much is your life <em>worth?</em></p><br><p>The way I frame this is: <strong>your utility</strong>.</p><br><p>A day of work is good for you but not for me. I would feel better knowing that I could replace or at least supplement your work. I can't imagine living half a day a week, though I might live half a year if it meant that I can help you out for a few days while continuing to live half a day a year. <strong>How much is your life</strong> <strong>worth?</strong> <strong>How much should I care about your feelings?</strong> I care about your utility because I can replace it with my own.</p><br><p>I can, in turn, care about your feelings, particularly when it comes to romantic relationships. My utility function for romantic compatibility (not in the sense of being mutually compatible) can and should go up as well. I would feel pretty terrible if I found someone and they fell in love with me, but then I couldn't reciprocate and fell out of love with them in a few months. I wouldn't have much fun or pleasure in dating someone so ill-suited to me. So I care about your <em>well-being</em> and how much this adds to my own. In fact, it's more or less only in this circumstance that I care about your well-being.</p><br><p>I don't care about your well being if your utility function goes down because you get less work done or are sad because you can't find a romantic relationship but no one else can. I don't care when you find a boyfriend or girlfriend if the quality of your life decreases. And I don't care too much if I feel bad if you get fired and no one else will hire you. The only person who cares for my feelings is me, and I care only about my own.</p><br><p>Your utility function is very important to me, or so I thought at first. It turned out that I care about most of my own utility functions, but not yours. I don't get much pleasure or utility out of knowing that my husband or wife is miserable or in a relationship that is failing. If this is so, it's fine with me: I can feel good about my own well-being, and that's usually enough to make up for what they're losing or have been through. And if you feel good about someone else's relationship or their well-being, that's also fine with me: if they enjoy their career or have a good romantic relationship or are able to relax with their in-laws, that's more valuable for me.</p><br><p>But if their utility function decreases and this causes them a lot of suffering and no other humans can make up for this, then I may have to care about it. And if there would be other humans who can make up for it then they are my best option.</p><br><p>My utility function for your feelings isn't linear. If I care enough about how you feel then I should also care a lot if the number of people you meet drops from 25 to 2, if I know that you are struggling in your career or on your romantic relationship and I can help or at least not get in the way, or if I enjoy your company and find your conversation stimulating and interesting.</p><br><p>I'm not sure if any of these cases is in direct disagreement with my basic idea. In all cases, though, my utilitarian calculation says that each of these changes is small but together they add up. If you meet someone who is good for your career then you may not see much else going on, and your chances of getting to meet others that are better for your career go from one-in-a-thousand to one-in-five. That's more than I'm willing to pay.</p><br><p>Of course, I may be wrong about any of this. Perhaps there are no other humans who would get to enjoy your relationships, and everything I've written so far has been a mistake. Who knows, I may feel the need to change my opinion as I spend more time with people who would make for great friendships and spouses.</p><br><p>More broadly, I'm trying to think about what a utilitarian calculus around feelings would look like, but I'm not very clear on how to frame the problem.</p><br><p>I used to think that the most accurate form of utilitarianism would look like total utilitarianism where the utility of <em>all</em> lives is compared, as if they are one large "bundle". But I'm not very confident here, and I'm not sure if total utilitarianism is ever the best tool.</p><br><p>One intuition I have is that it's easy to see how my own utility function should be weighted and my wife's utility function shouldn't count toward the bundle, but this seems problematic when it comes to comparing the bundle with others: one can imagine how I may want to weight my wife's utility differently from the utility of, say, the person who happens to be standing next to her. The only thing I can think of that would resolve this dilemma is to look at their utility <em>relative to mine</em>.</p><br><p>Suppose that there are 1000 people whose happiness matters to you at least a little bit. You should weight any one of <em>them</em> the same. Suppose there are also 10,000 people whose happiness you <em>don't</em> care about as much, but whose "happiness is valuable because it increases the happiness of the others around them". If you can substitute one additional 1,000 of the 1,000 people whose utility you care about for 1000 people who you don't care about, you should. Then suppose that there are 2,000,000 people who you don; but in this case it's not clear what the rule for weighting their utility is.</p><br><p>So then we get to the issue of "should there be one bundle". In the above example, I would weigh each of my wife's 1000 happiness units as exactly 1000 units of happiness relative to my own, and treat the bundle with the same priority then (weighting each member of the bundle the same is the correct way to compare bundles, is my current take). But I would care more about a friend of mine that has 1000 units of happiness, and I wouldn't think twice about a random stranger in a coffee shop with 2000 units.</p><br><p>I think this way of looking at utilitarianism is the closest I've come to getting in touch with the intuitions behind total utilitarianism. I find the general intuition compelling but I'm not sure how to make the intuition work in more detail.</p><br><p>I've also been thinking about what it would look like to put feelings into utility calculations. I don't have a good answer, but the closest I've seen to a decent idea is this one by Luke Muehlhauser.</p><br><p>I also think that feelings are pretty important in many cases, and that we're generally bad at thinking about them. One of the reasons I write this essay is to get feedback and thoughts about it from you guys. Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback on my previous post, and thanks in particular for Daniel Kokotajlo and Duncan Sabien for some of it. The fact that they were willing to share their thoughtful, nuanced comments (as opposed to just "it's bad") is the biggest gift I have received recently.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
