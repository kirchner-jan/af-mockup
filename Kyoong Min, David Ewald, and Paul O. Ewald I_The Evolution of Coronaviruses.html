</ul><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p>A virus lives in an environment of other viruses and its life is subject to a constant process of random mutations on its genes. This constant process of mutations forms the evolutionary history of the virus. However, one mutation may not change the gene sequence, but a mutation affecting some aspect of the function of the gene may lead to its death, e.g. a change in its receptor binding. A virus whose receptor is well-known with the human immune system lives.</p><br><p>However, another type of mutation which is able to affect the gene sequence and the function of the protein exists, e.g., a mutation which does not change the amino acid sequence, but does change the shape of the protein or it affects the protein shape. Such a mutation may be sufficient to evade the immune system and the virus may exist as a long-living infection in the human population. For example, the MERS coronavirus has existed in a human population for over ten months without causing serious disease in the majority of people infected.</p><br><p>Coronaviruses belong to a specific class of viral genetic data, which is represented by viruses from the group, which we can call corona-viruses. In this study we are primarily interested in the relationship between virus and host, which in this case is represented by the human body. This is a specific topic, which we do not address here. (Some examples of corona-viruse are covered in other articles, for example here.)</p><br><p>One interesting fact is that from the early days of the epidemic, different sources of virus were often found. This observation may provide an explanation for the high number of different coronavirus in nature, which are not able to interact with the human population and therefore exist in nature as independent agents. In our research, we have tried to understand how this phenomenon arises from evolutionary considerations.</p><br><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><br><p>In our opinion, evolution of coronaviruses is one of the most promising topics for further research on the future of public health. Coronavirues have been circulating in nature as a group of RNA pathogens and they may evolve to be more infectious, which would be important to determine the future of epidemics.</p><br><p>SARS belongs to a specific genus in corona-viurs, which we call coronavirus. Its main mutation MERS, which in the beginning of the epidemic caused mild symptoms without affecting any vital organs of people infected but leading to serious disease after a few days. This may be a new way of developing coronaviruses, which is able to survive in nature.</p><br><p>In our previous study, we have suggested possible evolutionary mechanisms which may increase the frequency of coronavirus infection in a human population. However, the main problem here is the evolutionary mechanism itself, and the idea to increase their level of transmission. It means that the mutation increases the frequency of the phenotype within the whole population, which is more dangerous than just increasing the frequency of the corresponding host genes in a population. On the other hand, this mode of the evolution could also increase the frequency of the virus in the environment (which is more stable as it cannot be destroyed).</p><br><p>In this article we have suggested that the coronavirus evolved to increase the frequency of its hosts in the environment. The evolution of coronavirus to increase the frequency within the human population and spread in the environment could be considered as its escape from the immune system.</p><br><p>Corona virus has been able to gain a wide host range and could become pandemic. Coronavirus has been detected in a wide variety of mammals in their different states of health, mainly domestic animals. Since the virus was detected in rodents, we propose that the host range of coronavirus had been probably already spread in the whole planet and humans were the ones who were infected.</p><br><p>It is known that the main way of coronavirale transmission is airborne and that its main route of spreading is through respiratory droplets (mainly from coughing, sneezing and singing). However, coronaviruses could also spread in the same way as the common flu: by direct contact (in the case of SARS) with the infected person who is in a later phase of virus replication (the "patient zero") or from food or water, which was made unsafe by the incubation period or by the virus replication.</p><br><p>In this opinion report, we have tried again to show what is known about coronaviruses and the coronavirus-human relationship from evolutionary point of view, which could be useful for future epidemics.</p><br><p>\t\tThe Host: The Virus</p><br><p>Summary</p><br><p>Coronary virus belongs to a group of genes, which we may call coronaviruses. Each virus within this group belongs to its own species, which we may refer to as coronavirus. Coronaviral infection may be fatal in the majority of cases. The evolution of this group of genes is mostly focused on understanding the relationship between virus, host and environment. These topics have been studied extensively, but are relatively new. Coronavviruses have been used as a model for studies of the evolution and its effects:</p><br><ol>
<li>Coronovirus infection is mainly spread through respiratory droplets.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Coronoviruses can spread between mammals.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Coronoviral genetic data is available since 2004.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Coronoviviral sequences have been detected in domestic and wild animals, including humans.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Coronavires can mutate to be more transmissible, which may be important to study the relation between virus-host and environment (more in the next section).</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Coronavipotences have been detected in different states of health.</li>
</ol><br><p><strong>1. Coronav\xc4\xabrus infection is mainly spread trough respiratory droplets.</strong></p><br><p>The main route of spread is respiratory droplets, mainly from coughing, snezing or singing. This can be proven easily by observing the symptoms of patients who have been infected.</p><br><p><em>Summary of main conclusions</em></p><br><p>In contrast to other viruses, corona-virus does not need to enter the cells, which is important from a biohacking point of view. It enters the respiratory tissue or the mucus layer, then invader to the lung. The virus may infect the cells in the area of the infection and replicate for a long period before infecting other cells.</p><br><p>Respiratory droplets of a person whose later are infected is a bigger risk compared with other people. Transmission of infection is not limited by the geographical distance but it is affected by the time of the day.</p><br><p>The main symptom is a dry cough for the first week, then it may develop into pneumonia and respiratory failure.</p><br><p>The incubation period is 5 days or less. If the virus is not caught by the immune system, it infects the cells of the respiratory and digestive system, causing acute respiratory distress. If the virus infects the cells in other parts of the organs, it induces infection. There is a strong correlation between the severity of the disease and whether the infection is caught by the immune response. The death rate is up to 5% in patients with severe disease. However, the majority of people recover. In fact, the death rate is not significant after the 7th day, while the risk of death after 30-50 days is still under 5%.</p><br><p>Coronoviruses, like all viruses, mutate.</p><br><p>For various reasons, including their high levels of mutation (in addition to the existing mutations, some viruses mutate easily due to their short life cycles), as well as the possibility of them changing their way of reproduction, increasing their own virulence and escaping host immune systems, it is very important to do genetic studies of these viruses. Sooner or later, there will be a pandemic and we may not even notice it.</p><br><p><strong>2. Coronavira is spread between mammals.</strong></p><br><p>Coronavi viruses belonging to the genus Coranavi are spread between mammals. The group of Coronavirus, which causes respiratory infection, belongs to the same genus. This group includes SARS and MERS, which have been known for a long time.</p><br><p><strong>3. Coronavire DNA sequences are available since 2004.</strong></p><br><p>It was known that some Coranos had the capability to change the sequence of their proteins. One such mutation causes more effective binding of a human receptor, which may be a sign of its ability to enter the cells and reproduce. Coranos of a certain type have been found not only in their natural hosts, namely wild animals like pangalos and pigs, to which wild birds are also exposed, but also in humans, e.g SARS. It is quite interesting to note, that there are some Coranos which have survived in human's immune system, and we can use them for research.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
