It would be nice to know how to teach great physics to all the people who are already in the pool. But if you start with the wrong question, the wrong answers might still be good.</p><br><p>I'm going to start from the first question \xe2\x80\x93 how to teach a student physics in the first place? Most people's answers would probably be to give them a book of problem solving, or a lot of lectures about basic physics like electricity, gravity, optics, and relativity; but I'm not sure this is the right approach. To do that book-learning correctly, you'd have to understand how to teach. And most textbooks are written in the manner we're familiar with. But suppose that in some completely different culture, no one has learned any of the standard lectures above. How different do the books have to be if we want them to work.</p><br><p>A good example is the <em>Chinese</em> education system I've mentioned earlier. In high school and college, students are instructed in the standard lectures and problems. Then at a very early age we are introduced to concepts in the same order as they appear in the standard lectures \xe2\x80\x93 electricity, gravity, etc. \xe2\x80\x93 but given without explanation. In all probability they will have gotten these from the family or by seeing them in everyday life. They have to be taught <em>how to learn.</em> I do not know if this is really a good way to approach this problem.</p><br><p>I've been watching the <em>BBC</em> in my native language (Russian) and they seem to be doing something similar. They have a section called "The Future of Life" where the host describes the challenges of life as we know it, such as the increasing power of machines and other forms of AI, and the consequences we already know about, such as climate change. Then they explain the concept of artificial insemination: in one episode, for example, a group of men are led into the "Future of Life" studio in the morning, injected with sperm, left there in the studio and have to wait for a woman to come for twenty years. The host explains the process of artificial inseminators using computers, but doesn't teach it to the listeners so that they can figure it out for themselves. So at least in one way, the show is already suggesting a way to solve this problem.</p><br><p>That probably doesn't change at all. I'm not sure what it would look like if the "Future of Humanity" guys explained in detail how to make a superintelligent AI, or if they showed a computer simulation and explained the algorithm behind it.</p><br><p>In contrast, the American science education system is full of lectures you've never heard before. Instead of the professor telling you "electron" and "potential", in a one-sentence lecture you're given the word "orbit" and told to work out the equations of motion and the energy distribution of a planet. Then you're told the word "potential" again, but now with a tiny little diagram, not quite a full sentence.</p><br><p>What good is that?</p><br><p>Well, let's say you're a freshman who wants to learn physics. You want to know what "energy" is. So the professor tells you about "kinetic energy", then "kinetic energy = m * v^2". Then that's explained to you once more, and then it's a bit more difficult. Then you're given the equation with the vector and the vector field, and you try to understand that. Then you try to figure out what v is, by looking at the diagram. Then you try the equation again, and now you can see that, for the moon, v is about 0, because in the diagram the moon is almost at rest.</p><br><p>So you give up.</p><br><p>You know what "energy"? Then this year they told you to spend years trying to find out for yourself from the equations of motion. You tried to find out about those, and you found out that you didn't know about forces. So now they tell you about forces. But no one says "Force = mass * acceleration", as if that information wasn't obvious.</p><br><p>If you look at physics curricula, not only is "energy" always the final result, but every time you're taught something you can easily see what it's needed to explain the end result, and almost none of the "steps" are wasted. This also applies to the history of science. Every bit of the path to relativity is needed for the final product, and each of the steps you take along the way is a piece of the puzzle.</p><br><p>I see the American education system as an attempt to make physics seem like the sort of science where understanding all the steps is really important. Even the professors in the lectures don't emphasize the importance of knowing your equations of motion, or your equations of forces and accelerations. Why not? Because the audience might say "Well, I read that in the textbook. I don't want to learn something you don't already know."</p><br><p>This is a big problem because <em>the students who are best at physics tend to have a natural interest in mathematics and the sciences in general _and _have an exceptional desire to learn things and understand them.</em> These people are the ones who end up in the best undergraduate programs, those at the top of their class. And unfortunately, they're some of the people who are least likely to like physics, so it's really hard to create an American program where physics is interesting.</p><br><p>But I think the solution is to look at different cultures of science and education. Consider the Chinese education system (the one mentioned above). It's not that they don't teach any of the standard material for physics, like electricity and gravity. But they teach it _in a totally different order, _and they _tell them in a totally different order. _You follow the steps needed to solve the problem they give, and if you understand one they'll give you the next one. You understand the whole process as a whole, and you can use some of it for other problems. Also the cultural knowledge (i.e. that the future of humanity is a really big and important thing) is part of it.</p><br><p>A similar approach would be to look at the British education system and copy it as much as possible. I don't expect the BBC or anyone else to agree, but if you look at physics and the other sciences in school, I could be completely and totally wrong about this. I could just be seeing this because I live in Britain, but it's hard to imagine it's not like that somewhere else. It's certainly true that students in other countries learn other subjects (like math and language, not so much in the US, although I do learn calculus and English grammar and rhetoric well enough that I know they have the concepts even if they don't know how to express them or use them). And it's not hard to imagine different cultural knowledge. It seems like there's an obvious way in which the Chinese approach is more like our own. You follow a basic education with a bunch of problem solving exercises, but at the end you have to understand it and apply it in new areas.</p><br><p>There's a question I have about this approach: why is this so much worse in China than we see in the US? My sense is that many people see the Chinese approach as a failure of American capitalism: instead we see professors selling the problem solvers to the students, and this is the whole problem with American capitalism.</p><br><p>If this is right, then we can think of two problems to solve: how to create more great American professors, and how to create a culture where a major university can teach students in the Chinese fashion. (Yes, maybe this would also give some nice social gains. But I could think of one reason to pursue a plan like this.)</p><br><p>This leads me to the second question, if you're wondering what the point is anyway: how do we create more great professors?</p><br><p>Let's say we have a new generation of physics professors and we want to teach them in a different fashion. What do we do?</p><br><p>One thing would be to start with a new book of problem solving problems. We used that with the first generation. But when I read textbooks I don't see anyone writing things like "If you start from the basic equations you'll get to where you want faster if you remember to apply the Euler-Lagrange equation than if you look it up after the fact." There are a number of things that have worked well for some fields that have not worked in others. How can we figure out what works well? Do professors in other countries teach students in different orders? I know something works well in a certain field if some professors at other universities use it in their courses. Maybe one of the differences is how much they emphasize teaching over explaining the material, how much they emphasize learning by solving problems, and how often they use it in classes.</p><br><p>The second thing would be to do experiments. I know some people who are interested in teaching physics but aren't interested in research. And I know a lot of people who are interested now but think research would mean giving up their jobs, and I know some physics professors who aren't interested in teaching.</p><br><p>But most people are in both camps. Some students want to understand the principles behind things but would prefer to explore them in their free time, and some physics professors want to have their choice between research and teaching.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
