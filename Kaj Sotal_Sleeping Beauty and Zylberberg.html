In addition, during this time each awakening is not treated as a new experience: rather, she <em>expects</em> that she will wake up during this period, so she does not try to fall asleep again before waking up again. Finally, if she's woken up and her memory device has not yet been scanned, but there is someone else who can scan each morning, this scan might either be done immediately or kept for future scans.</p><br><p>This problem is intended as a toy model to illustrate the core issues surrounding the philosophy of personal identity and reference for entities that are kept around for a long time after being created. However it might also be useful in illustrating some aspects of quantum mechanics.</p><br><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><br><p>This problem was inspired by some discussions of the problem of reference I had seen on the LW site, and also some discussions of the related Sleeping Beauty problem that had been going on at Less Wrong on and off for a while. Note that this is not meant to be an actual problem that is set out with probability assignments, but rather a general discussion of how to handle the scenario, with the intent of creating a problem out of the discussion.</p><br><p>(Some of the more recent discussions have started using the problem of "The Presumptuous Philosopher" to get at similar issues, but the "Presumptuous Philosophers" thought experiment isn't all that great, particularly because if you take the Presumptuous Physicist problem and make it into a real problem, the person being observed gets significantly <em>more</em> detailed information about the experiment than in the Presumptious Philosopher; if anyone thinks they can propose a real analogue to Presumptuous Phil by keeping a copy of the original "Presumptious Physicist" around for several days, leave a comment.)</p><br><p><strong>Previous attempts at solutions:</strong></p><br><p>Some solutions to this problem have been suggested, and I'll briefly describe a few of them before going on to discuss some of the more recent discussion.</p><br><p>Sleeping Beauty has been traditionally answered by saying that she is the same woman at all times. This is called the Self-Sampling Assumption, or SSA for short.</p><br><p>It has been argued that this is a mistake, and that there has to be more to the question. (Sleeping Beauty being part of a larger collection of observers being made out of smaller parts that are still identical over time does not strike many people as compelling.)</p><br><p>One possible reason why one might favor the Self-Sampled Assumption is that one hopes to capture some of the meaning of the question by saying that there is a Sleeping Beauty, and we are asking this question to determine what the original was, and that it persists into the new version. But it seems possible to answer the same question by saying that the new copy is <em>one of many similar copies</em> that exist at a certain moment. The question then reduces to the one about how to deal with copies. And it seems like there should be a "strong version" of the Self-Sambing Assumption in which the copies are <em>all</em> of the same person except that there is a random subset in each copy that behaves differently from the rest. (One might wonder how SIA would do on this example, or in general: under what conditions do different observations give rise to different copies?.)</p><br><p>My first attempt at trying to solve this was to propose a rule as follows: When a copy is created, the new copy is put in some sort of a "temporary stasis", until the time for the next memory scan. I proposed counting the first and later copies for each time, to get a total number of copies that was preserved if the memory device was scanned. Thus, a sleeping beauty with a memory device that only gave her access to the day would have memories from two days worth of "past" her total number of sleeping beauties, while a beauty with a memory that said she was awake at night the moment she was copied would experience only one day from then on.</p><br><p>However, I noticed that in that proposed version an <em>awoken</em> beauty would either only experience part of the day or experience an entire year, depending on whether or not the memory device was used, but she would never wake up one day and actually experience it twice. After some attempts I could not think of any other way to solve it. I have been assuming that the memory device is <em>unchanged</em> during the wake up, and that's why each awakening is not a new experience\xe2\x80\x94but if it were changed then it seems like the same awakening would be a new experience each time, so it would be double the total number of awakenings.</p><br><p>Perhaps this is just a problem that is impossible to resolve without making some rather unusual compromises. Perhaps I do not <em>really</em> want the number of awakenings to be doubled, but rather some sort of <em>average _to get the correct reference class from. If so, I am not at all convinced that I can have this average without the SSA\xe2\x80\x94the average seems _too</em> arbitrary to me without some other arguments in favor of it. I do not like the idea of the number of times I am told I am a particular person being preserved <em>constant</em> without any other reason in favor of it, and it seems like that's the kind of thing that might tend to favor SSA if one could get away with it. Otherwise I am having a hard time coming up with an acceptable average value.</p><br><p><strong>Solutions I've been considering:</strong></p><br><p>Next step: I have been thinking about whether the problem can be made to be an actual decision analysis problem. Then I can just keep adding up days and days, and I will never fall into any kind of paradox. (I do not think this would fully resolve the problem, however.) The problem also seems to be rather close to one that can be rephrased as a Newcomb's problem: if the problem has a "real" copy, then the predictor can make more real predictions than if the copies exist only in memory, because if she needs to make one prediction for a hundred copies she can just wait for one hundred days to do it instead of waiting ten thousand. Also, if the problem has some kind of a real physical copy, then the copy is real, and it is possible for the experiment to actually happen twice using new memory devices instead of being thought experiment.</p><br><p>So far my attempts at making the problem into something more like a decision analysis problem failed\xe2\x80\x94for now I am somewhat worried that I am just making this more confusing and unhelpful.</p><br><p><strong>Updateless decision?</strong></p><br><p>It seems worth noting that there is a possible answer that would make this problem actually <em>helpful</em>, at least according to some formulations of CDT and EDT. One could call it the updateless decision of Sleeping Beauty; though this name isn't really a good distinction unless it is combined with something like "causal decision", it might make Sleeping Beauty seem less selfish and more like "the real decision maker" in the heads versus tails world. (Though I have been giving my version of updatelessness the name before for now, but I might be biased.) One might further argue that under SIA Sleeping Beauty would actually get <em>more precise</em> information, at least assuming that the memories she has are exact copies of her and do not allow for any potential tampering due to the memory device\xe2\x80\x94this would require at least some of the copies to be preserved, but at the same time might be able to make it a lot less clear about _which _copies are preserved.</p><br><p>With these kinds of improvements, the question reduces to a decision question\xe2\x80\x94is it good to get out of the bed? If you were a CDT agent, your answer would be determined by whether or not having just got out of the bed gives you good evidence of being a person who just got out of a bed, even if you are still asleep when the experimenter actually wakes you up and then runs the experiment. If you are an Updateless EDT agent, you can simply always choose "no" to have more evidence to justify the choice. This seems nice, and I can imagine some actual use of this in the near future. However, I wonder if some of this is something that is better discussed in the form of an actual problem, rather than just thinking about, so that Sleeping Beauty doesn't have to worry about what the experimenters will actually do with her, in the future or when her new self wakes up and reads this blog post.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
