This is very rare.</p><br><p>But it also happens.</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>On LessWrong there are people saying 'yes' all the time, it seems really common. And they're wrong all the time too. Often people say 'no' just to avoid unpleasantness of 'yes' or because they want to look like they were already working. But also I've gotten 'yes' from people who seemed, well, 'yes' all along. There's just a common sense way of being 'yes' that you might not have consciously adopted. And I think there's an important skill here.</p><br><ul>
<li>\tI think people who say 'no' to requests, but not in most other interactions, do <em>not</em> really have their 'no' activated. Whereas other people have it readily available to them. And I think once this is something you know how to do, it makes a big difference to say 'no'.</li>
</ul><br><p>In our conversation on epistemic spot checks, I mentioned someone I know who is very good at not being wrong. I think this is the skill of 'actually saying no' to questions about things they're uncertain of, and it really shines through when they're trying to give answers to <em>your</em> questions about things <em>they</em> are uncertain of. And when they encounter someone asking 'is X true?' or 'does Y seem correct?' and they're like 'wait I didn't think of that question! Let me find out what the other people in this community see.'</p><br><p>In the same conversation, I also mentioned how, at a meetup, there had been a bunch of disagreements about which of these two questions were more likely true:</p><br><ul>
<li>There is a coin on the table I have never seen before, and you say 'heads'</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There is another coin on the table, and I don't expect you to lie about it, and I don 't anticipate seeing it differently, if it comes up the same way</li>
</ul><br><p>And I was curious about which coin people expected to see. I think they had more agreement about this than they had been leading me to expect at every turn. And in real contexts like this, I don't particularly expect 'no'. I expect 'yes' or 'it doesn't seem right to say' because 'yes' or  'it doesn't sound right to say' is also often 'no'. (I'm not sure about the exact number of times you can say it with something close to 'no' without it sounding like you're _annoyed _or _disliked _the question, but I expect I'm at least an order of magnitude wrong.)</p><br><p>What's really cool about this is that this doesn't actually mean agreeing in advance with 'heads'. Rather, just that there's some degree of 'no' activation that's taking place that's not the same activation as agreement with 'heads'. And this is one of the most amazing things about this skill, is that you can actually 'activate no' in response to things in the world that are not things you _agree with. _And I think that's one of the most important ways in which humans really improve other humans' epistemics (which other humans benefit from too!).  It seems like we are quite bad at having epistemic spot checks where we say yes, but it's very easy to say no. </p><br><p>It's also one of the most crucial tools to have if you want to really know something. And this is something that people who are very good at saying 'no' often don't develop or never explicitly learn to notice.   </p><br><p>I'll conclude with a story that someone told me about how they got into AI safety, because I was surprised that others didn't seem to have that insight. They had this 'I'm not sure what x should mean' or 'what is the right way to define' or something, and they got into AI Safety through a bunch of this. And my mind kept going 'well I expect people don't do that'. And this is in fact the case (more on this in post next week). But I found this case to have interesting lessons. </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
