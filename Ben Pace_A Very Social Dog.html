</ul><br><p><em>TL;DR: it's not what you think. But it helps to know I'm happy I have it.</em></p><br><p>Introduction:</p><br><p>This post is about a particular kind of dog: a social dog.</p><br><p>Social dog is a term I've defined, but it actually exists in a larger field. My understanding is that people tend to be more or less social dogs when they meet other people. When they're alone, they're more solitary; when they're with other people, they're more social. But there's a range of dogs which are social at different points of the day. And it has implications for when they go out of their way to meet strangers.</p><br><p>My Dog:</p><br><p>My dog is more of a solitary, lazy sort. She loves to be in the garden, and the dogs at the park, but she doesn't really like people. This is unusual\xe2\x80\x94for someone who got her way to be a bit of a dog, she is a pretty social dog most of the time. When I'm with her, she's friendly, but not overbearing. She isn't dog-like at all, but she is social anyway. She was born when I was 24 and I don't have any socialising as part of her, so she's an anomaly.</p><br><p>She is also the only real'social' or 'dog-like' dog she has around. The other two are too self-conscious to be comfortable in public places, and neither of them like meeting new people.</p><br><p>When I get home, I go and hug her! That's the cue I like, but that's also what makes people uncomfortable. If I didn't hug her, she might think I wasn't excited to see her, which isn't true, but it's something I worry about getting her to do.</p><br><p>It's hard to put into words what makes dogs happy. My dog and I go for a walk and she looks at the birds in the park and then she gets really excited because she sees a squirrel across the river. She's happy most of the time, but when this happens, it's pretty epic. It's hard to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it.</p><br><p>Here's what it's like to be me with her, when I am not with her and she is by herself in the garden.</p><br><p>Her other dog is a little more social, but he's only the least of our three; our other two are the same.</p><br><p>I don't really understand what makes my dog happy. It has to be around meeting people, or, if I'm in the garden with the other dogs, but the dog next to us is more social. It's not quite the same thing, but I can't put a finger on it.</p><br><p>I've asked her about it and she's tried to describe it, but mostly I think about it when she's on the internet doing something like this:</p><br><p>You see, most people are going to be a bit scared of dogs who have these big eyes and want to hug them. I think something like 'I know they're not happy to be this scared and this is why, but it's this way for safety reasons so they need to get over it.'</p><br><p>My dog looks like this: she's looking at the dog next to her because she likes it. She's not trying to scare anyone, she just wants a chance to be happy.</p><br><p>I think about my dog, and there's a part there that's very'social'. There's a part that sees this as something she needs to put up with to be happy. There's part that recognizes 'this is the world we live in' and thinks she needs to learn how to adjust to this.</p><br><p>It might be that the other two dogs don't know what they're missing out on, and just need to get some lessons too. One of my friends has two dogs I don't usually see around. The first dog was super social. The second one was a bit of a handful, but not as much as mine.</p><br><p>Another friend brought their dog down to visit and asked me to go out with my dog on a walk; and she said she kept saying 'where's your dog?' I think that was pretty normal dog socialising, except with my dog. That was fun.</p><br><p>The fact that I had a dog at that time, rather than some other dog, also changed things. I'd previously heard of dogs going after people they didn't own, and I used to take my dog back to the park if there were other dogs. It seemed like 'if I want a dog that goes after other dogs, I'll get one that does it'. So my dog going after dogs didn't really cause me to feel the urge to have lots of dogs that run after other dogs. It was something else that caused that effect.</p><br><p>In the park there are lots of other dogs. A pack of them comes to play. Another comes by to join us. No one ever seems to care. At all. They have their own pack that's just there. My dog sits off to the side and doesn't get involved with that at all, although I would say she'd be welcome. If she's wanted she can join in. It's just people who want to be alone that are there with her. And so far, that has been more than enough.</p><br><p>The two other dogs are of a sort, I think. There's a third one, the most social of our three. She's really friendly, but not much of a barker. Like mine, she was born over a year ago. She's part of a larger dog-owning family, so we've never socialised with her. We don't know what makes her happy, but she <em>does</em> do lots of dog things with her family and seems to have a really social spirit. She lives with a woman who's a dog owner, and also comes across as a very social dog.</p><br><p>I have another, very different sort of dog. This is her, and she's just the friendliest of any of the three\xe2\x80\x94except for the one that's with her the most. She's the only one of us three who is constantly 'on her toes'. This means she has to be careful what she does for it to be OK and she has to check up on people a lot. It's also the most energy consuming behavior on my part! The other two don't need to be as much of a look out.</p><br><p>I dona have any good advice for this dog. There's not much I can think of about helping her. I can't imagine her having a problem with meeting strangers and that being the sort of problem that might lead to behaviour changes. All I can think of is 'don't be over controlling, encourage her to do more of her stuff and if that doesn't quite work try giving her space where she can be with other dogs by herself'. I can see that she has no interest in other dogs outside of her family, and that this isn't normal behavior, but I can also see the fact she has the above described problem doesn't mean she should change it. It's something she's working on. Maybe the best thing I can say is it's fine to be a very different sort of person than the others you have when you are alone.</p><br><p>Here's a photo from when she was more active and the other two dogs came by with their own dogs too (so the total number of dogs there was five), that better matches how I think of her.</p><br><p>Her two dogs, of course, are the very different sort of dogs that do everything together, but also not a particular way\xe2\x80\x94they're very good friends for us. I think we're pretty different too, in a good way. People are pretty confused by who these dogs are and why we're interested in them.</p><br><p>And then, after this post, I'm going to have more to say.</p><br><p>Some of My Best Friends are Social Dogs</p><br><p>Other people might have dogs that aren't at all'social' or who only like meeting a few people. Or they might not have any. There's a wide range of dog behavior in people, with social dogs at one end and solitary dogs at the other. And a huge range of different behavior in people too. There are people who like meeting new people all the time, and there are people who are more like me, who prefer an unusual dog and a different person to meet.</p><br><p>I don[t] have any particular friends who are social dogs, and so I'm going to talk mainly about me and my dog here. But I do want some pointers on what makes some people better at meeting strangers and making friends with them than other people, and how to approach meeting strangers effectively.</p><br><p>First of all, I think some people who like to meet strangers have better social skills than some people who don't.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
