We're interested in the part about linguistic intuitions, so let's see what these are!</p><br><p>Language and Grammar</p><br><p>Gwern's first comment on this topic:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>As someone who has spent years studying language, and knows plenty about how words are made and work in my head, it's always good to see a good discussion of these things. The post itself was written by Michael Johnson, who knows as much about the study of language and meaning as anybody on Earth, I hope this gets published somewhere someday!</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This post begins with a discussion of grammar and its origins. It's not too surprising for regular people, but I'm sure the academic literature will surprise experts.</p><br><blockquote>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>
</blockquote><br><p>In English a word is a sequence of consonants and vowels. It can be any length, in principle, although we are more likely to use less common words and words from more frequent parts of the alphabet. There are no rules regarding what letters or combinations of letters you can use as words, so in principle, you can have any words you like.</p><br><p>To figure out how words are made in the brain, you have to ask a further question: Is there a general rule that words use certain combinations of letters more often than other combinations? <strong>If so, where does the rule come from?</strong></p><br><p>"You've got it!" Michael Johnson shouts gleefully. "Our ability to distinguish between words as different comes from a <em>universal grammar</em> in our brains. A universal grammar is a set of rules that govern word use throughout the world."</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"And where in the world is the universal grammar?" one of the other reviewers asks.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>"In our heads!" Michael says. "Look, here's an excerpt from the first page of a dictionary. Let's say we're looking at the word 'a' and we see that it looks like the letter 'a' is followed by a vowel and then another letter. A universal grammar would say that the proper word that fits that pattern would be 'wa'."</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"Wait a minute. If that were the case, we wouldn't be able to understand what 'waw' or'sow' meant. If they were syllables, those rules wouldn't have applied."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>"Exactly," says Michael. "A <em>principle of compositionality</em> holds that words are generally composed of one head letter and one or more sub-head letters of an appropriate <em>syllable</em>. This means that when you find a word in the dictionary, say 'waw', you know that it contains the same letter and vowel sounds as the same syllable, 'wau', meaning that you know that it is composed of the head letter and sub-head sound 'au'. For that reason, when you see the word 'faw-a' and it seems to match the syllables 'fau-a,' your brain assumes that the first letter is faw and the second letter is a."</p><br><blockquote>
<p>[pause]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>"And a what?" someone asks.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"_Auh! Ahhrm. _Oh that's the part that surprised me when I first learned all this: That every word in English was generated by a rule set composed of a head letter and a sub-head."</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>"But why?" asks the voice of skepticism from the audience.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>"<em>Why?</em>" Michael says, exasperated. "Because the <em>principle is part of the rule set! _How do you _not</em> learn this?"</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>The other reviewers look at each other. Then Michael raises his hands in a questioning gesture.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>"Ok, suppose we say that <em>all</em> the rules must follow the principle of compositionality. How does a brain know when a rule does so? By looking at lots of <em>examples</em>! That's the only way a rule can be <em>taught</em>."</p><br><p>Gwenn continues to provide this example, with great joy, until she hits on the problem of understanding "sound". Michael admits that the question of how speech sounds are represented in the physical brain is not well understood, and there may be nothing to say than to say "We don't know". Gwenn goes on to say:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>This problem is really tricky. For example English speakers often pronounce'sound' and'sing' interchangeably in English, despite the fact that'sound' is the action and'sing' is the perception. If we ask a group of French speakers and Americans to rate how often they say sound and sing, they rate it being used the "second" most often, while French speakers and Americans rate it being used "the most" often.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>How can we explain this difference between English speakers and other groups of speakers? It seems to me there are some strong cultural associations with the word sound. I wonder how those associations work \xe2\x80\x93 are they simply cultural background knowledge or some type of unconscious thinking they do (which seems to be the same ability that makes people fluent in a language but not others)? My understanding so far is that there are cultural associations involved and also a complicated series of rules in the brain related to sound, so I don't know if there is anything to be said and it's a hard problem to solve.</p><br><p>This is one of the most complicated aspects of language. It is a major challenge just to <em>formalize</em> the rules of grammar, how do you represent sound in physical reality? And it's even more tricky to explain just how we find the mental representation in the first place.</p><br><p>We've gone over three key posts in this line of thinking. The third one (How the Mind Works) is particularly important because the problem of grammar and language (and so the problem of thought) have long been considered a major stumbling block to understanding the mind.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>At the risk of overstating my case, I claim this is the most important post I'm going to do on the blog today.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>-Gwern</p><br><p>I hope it turns out well. This is going to be a huge project. This is a very important and interesting problem, and I have very little knowledge of how it is accomplished in the brain, so it's going to be very tricky.</p><br><p>So, for that to happen, there has to be at least one person, who has both an interest in the topic and has the ability to spend a lot of time thinking through what can and can't be said, what language representations are and aren't present in the brain, and how such language representations are <em>learned</em> rather than known at birth.</p><br><p>It's hard enough to come to the topic, with lots of background and the issues surrounding it, but knowing that one has a problem that needs to be solved means that one has to actually do the work to reach the answer.</p><br><p>There just isn't enough information available on the topic, from either neuroscience or cognitive psychology, to work on the problem without looking at both sides of it. There's too many people trying to answer the wrong question, or only attempting to answer the correct question but with incorrect ideas about how. There's too much disagreement and confusion, for what amounts to one single problem.</p><br><p>If we need to have experts (or at least, researchers on this topic) who have a good understanding of the domain so they can understand just how hard the task is, as well as a fair amount of background on the neuroscience of the topic, then we need to do at least three things:</p><br><p>1) Figure out the key question, "Do human beings have the kinds of mental representations that correspond to word meanings?" or perhaps "Are humans capable of understanding language?" or something like that.</p><br><p>That's a problem nobody has taken seriously. My guess is the leading research on this topic does not yet know how to answer it well. If it can be answered, it has to be answered. Otherwise it's probably still too early to tackle the problem. We don't need to worry about talking to the scientists, we need to talk to the people who are trying to figure out the answer without a clear idea of the kind of explanation they're looking for. The important thing is to <em>really</em> understand the question, not to try to frame things in a way that is likely to fool the average person. We can ask if a machine learning system uses a model of language that fits certain statistical regularities, or what the actual representations are in the model's physical instantiation for each of those regularities, but we can't make the leap to the question of whether any human being capable of being a speaker has a representation of a category in their brain and whether that representation maps to the relevant regularity.</p><br><p>(If someone proposes a way to <em>answer</em> the question of a machine learning system using a model of language, we can then see how it maps to the question of "Are human beings capable of understanding language?", but only after that does it turn into the question of "Does understanding language in general require a human brain?")</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
