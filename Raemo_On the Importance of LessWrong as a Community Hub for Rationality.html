LessWrong has more of an "everything at once" approach.</p><br><p>A lot of these thoughts relate to my feelings towards LessWrong. The thing I've been thinking for the last few months, a while back Eliezer said "It seems to me that LessWrong has become something of a community hub, it's a place where a lot of people who are interested in rationality go to meet each other and talk about it. Not everyone here is really into rationality, but a lot of people on LessWrong seem interested in rationality, and so a lot of sub-cultures have formed here. A hive mind, if you will."</p><br><p>The main reason I'm talking about LessWrong now, though, is because I'm a rationalist with a tendency to get absorbed in specific subcultures and subgroups, especially related to rationality. But <em>I noticed</em> that while I'm sure LessWrong can serve that purpose, I think it would be useful if it was also a central node in the broader web of rationality.</p><br><p>Maybe the rationalist community will eventually grow into a larger, larger community that has a clear separation from the mainstream. (Or maybe the main role of LessWrong is to serve as the new in-group for the broader community) Either way, if LessWrong does eventually become its own community center, it's important that if <em>anyone</em> in the broader community is a member of that center, it's a positive reflection of the broader community.</p><br><p>But right now it can be a pain in the ass to attend meetups because it's pretty hard to coordinate multiple places. There isn't a physical hub where people can meet up.</p><br><p>So if LessWrong had its own, separate physical space, it would be much easier for people who are interested to meet and get excited about the same ideas. And if the meetups are happening online, it's hard to coordinate timezones, especially because the people who live in major U.S. cities are much more geographically diverse than the people who attend major U.S.-based meetups.</p><br><p>It's also nice to have some place where people can go to have a few rationalists to hang out with, not just on the Internet, but <em>together</em>. (There are meetups and other community events happening, but they're not as easily <em>visibly</em> available. It sort of feels like the only community events that are happening are ones that I might run into. There isn't actually a place where there are regular gatherings happening where people are planning on being around right next to other people who are planning on being nearby right near each other).</p><br><p>To that end I thought I should note a few things about a central community hub that I think has already been mentioned, but not made explicit:</p><br><p><strong>The location shouldn't be that important.</strong> There isn't really a standard meeting location. People who live in areas near the bay area might get together at home, but it's not very central and if there's one person with a different time zone, you can't really do much with it. So there doesn't seem to be much reason to try and choose a central location\xe2\x80\x94the location should be where people want to be, not where the people who do things want to live.</p><br><p><strong>It's probably worth having a physical store</strong>. There are some meetups happening online, but it seems really inefficient if you live in a city where there are a lot of rationalists and don't really have much in the way of meetups happening in your city, so you end up going to a different city every time. It makes me sad not to have a physical place that people can regularly visit which serves that purpose. However...</p><br><p><strong>It shouldn't be hard for LessWrongers to have their own physical store</strong>. We are a community hub, but I think it's possible to have a meetup store and a community hub, which would mean that there would be LessWrong meetups, but also be a way for LessWrong people to hang out in other regions. So it's not that hard for meetups to happen even in places where LessWrongers are rare. It seems to me that if you already live near some other LessWrongers, the most valuable thing you can do is have a nearby place that you can hang out with other LessWrong people.</p><br><p><strong>People should be able to organize events there</strong>. If you're going to have a store and an online community page, you want to be able to have recurring events so that people don't have to plan them out every time, but you also want to avoid having one site with a bunch of events and another site that has exactly the minimal number of events so that people who are only interested in the minimal number of things can easily find them. LessWrong is in the middle of a few different communities, so this may be possible.</p><br><p>It seems like the sort of thing that's a nice thing to do if you have some extra money you can donate to the project. We might want to make it easy to organize these events, but I think that's the sort of thing which could potentially grow into an ongoing, successful project.</p><br><p><strong>There should be an easily visible representation of the community</strong>. It seems like rationalist-wannabee meetup spaces aren't really a thing yet. There's the meetup.com pages, but they're hard for newcomers to find. There's also LW, but that only displays one community hub at a time. I don't really have a great solution for that, but perhaps putting a big red button that says "Rationality Space" near the top of the page might be a good start.</p><br><p>And this might be one place where the rationalist movement is bottlenecked. I'm personally interested in creating a set of events/\xe2\x80\x8bmeetups that have the sort of shared goals as the original meetups, but I don't really know how to write those things up in a way that would actually attract people. I've experimented with having meetups, but it seems pretty hard to coordinate enough activity on LW that the meetups actually happen.</p><br><p>So to me this felt like the sort of important thing that might be worth setting up before the rationalist movement grows too much. I think it might be possible to get some critical mass from LessWrong just doing it with rationality, and also get some traction on the online meetup thing if that's viable.</p><br><p>I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on this. (or thoughts on how to improve LessWrong)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
