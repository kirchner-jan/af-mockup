I'm very grateful to him for an open conversation, both for me (who found it interesting, helpful, etc.) and for the world at large, which benefits from having some written public record of a dialogue that happened. The two-hour call was prompted by an email he sent me (see the bottom of this post, "why inequality is still growing")</p><br><p>I've added two small footnotes, and several little references to existing posts or papers, to address some objections people have raised in the comments here. Most of the rest is just a question-answer dialog we had.</p><br><ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol><br><p>1a. The basic idea for this post: the economy is currently inegalitarian.</p><br><p>[I'll explain how I want to use "inegalitarian" throughout. He prefers the phrase "inequality," and I'll generally agree with him as a descriptor of the distribution of wealth in the United States. But in this post, I'll use "inequality" in a special technical sense in which the idea is that we should expect that some people get rich much faster than most people get wealthy. So, by default, inequality implies that some people have higher average incomes than others. It's still the case that the distribution of wealth is a huge win if wealth can be divided <em>equally</em> between people, but there is in fact a huge amount of inequality between people, and the inequality is getting larger.]</p><br><p>[I'm going to use the term "ineegalitarian" throughout this post, and the phrase is coming from Paul. I think that economic inequality has grown for decades, and that the trend continues to grow. He's using the word in the sense of economic inequality <em>as a descriptor of society in general</em>, not in the sense of a strict quantitative sense, although a lot of the things the phrase "inegalitarian" is doing will actually be good in absolute terms.]</p><br><p>The economic debate is a very interesting debate (among other disagreements). But it's very hard to get a real handle on these kinds of disagreements via the standard channels. My hope in this post is that <em>even if</em> Paul disagrees with some economist, he can (at least for now) talk directly about things like this:</p><br><p>For example, suppose that there is such a thing as "average worker productivity." The economist says that productivity is getting higher and higher over the past fifty years. The economist might try to defend this claim by saying that while productivity has grown, most people's wages haven't grown (and, for a variety of reasons that aren't going to get into here, the median <em>income</em> could still get higher). I don't think Paul is going to be able to refute this very cleanly. He can argue, "If you had predicted before seeing the numbers that there should be an equality of incomes for most folks, you might have made a mistake; but there's not a mistake, there's actually empirical evidence that average worker productivity is getting better."</p><br><p>We can also make the same point about "average household income." A typical economist might try to <em>refute</em> the claim that "average household income has increased in real terms every year since 1960." They might say that if you had predicted that average income per household had been growing in real terms since 1960, you might have thought that you were in for a surprise, but in fact it's not surprising at all.</p><br><p>(That kind of thing is, in fact, often a reasonable reaction from a skeptical economist).</p><br><p><strong>Inequality isn't inherently bad for the world.</strong></p><br><p>There are a number of arguments against increasing economic inequality, as I discuss below. But there's one simple claim that I'd like to make even in the absence of these arguments:</p><br><p>If economic inequality <em>is</em> getting larger, and inequality is getting larger in part because better economies should increase it (as I argue at the end), then this should have two very different effects on society.</p><br><p>First, there will be a cost to poor people of being poorer. They will probably be <em>less</em> able to afford basic costs like food, health care, education.</p><br><p>Second, if inequality is bad for the poor, then rich people are benefitting disproportionately, and so we should expect rich people to support policies or interventions that benefit the rich more, and to promote inequality where it benefits them more.</p><br><p>And, so far, inequality is getting worse because economies have gotten better. If your country's economy is already doing well, you should expect inequality to get worse instead of better.</p><br><p><strong>Income inequality has been growing. It's been increasing for decades!</strong></p><br><p>That should be one of the biggest red flags you get:</p><br><p>i. Is there a way that the economy could stay in-egalitarian over the long run, without doing worse for any individual person? Yes, there is.</p><br><p>ii. What does the economy <em>currently</em> look like? Yes, right now it looks clearly inegalitarian. Why?</p><br><p>One answer might be, there is a big trend in favor of increasing inequality, a trend that has continued for decades (since the 1960s and onward). So we get big pay increases and rising inequality, and then we also get big unemployment (or rising employment insecurity) and an increasingly unequal distribution of political power (as measured by wealth).</p><br><p>Another answer, though, is that the current pattern is an accident of history: it's largely a consequence of our historical circumstances. If we had different circumstances (a different technology, or an earlier economic crisis, or a different starting point for technological development), we would now have mostly low-income countries, like the middle parts of Nigeria, with the developed world in the same place it currently is, with most people still having pretty good lives. (This kind of scenario is part of what could be called the "inclusive economics" scenario that you can get from a book like <em>Equality</em>).</p><br><p>I want to think about both of these answers at the same time. I think it's <em>slightly more likely that inequality is improving</em> because, historically, <em>wealth inequality</em> has become a bigger part of our picture. But the economic picture overall is <em>much more robustly</em> an inegalitarian picture in favor of the "better economy" explanation.</p><br><p><strong>Inegallyarianity isn't a bad thing in itself, when compared to the alternatives</strong></p><br><p>It is important to remember that if we have two societies A and B where people have more wealth or less wealth, then it's very important that society is _not _doing worse for some people in society. And societies that would be good to be more unequal can still do better overall than societies that are less unequal.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
