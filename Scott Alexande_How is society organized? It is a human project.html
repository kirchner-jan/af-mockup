For example, societies with norms of trust will often have strong institutions such as law enforcement, which make society safer and more productive than societies without those norms. As a corollary, societies which have developed strong institutions aren't automatically the most productive. For example, Russia or ancient Rome might have developed strong institutions but also developed a culture of violence. That being said, I think the relationship is often overdetermined\xe2\x80\x94it is hard to imagine a world in which strong institutions of trust and law enforcement never developed. So we have to look at particular societies and ask how they had certain institutions, and why did they have certain institutions, and what were their good outcomes. This post will mostly be about the norms of trust and law, since it is the one for which I have a clearer concept of how it relates to productivity.</em></p><br><p>I started the previous post with the anecdote of my father being able to send a letter by telegram. Now that anecdote is an exaggeration, in the sense that my father never did that with anyone except one particular friend of his I have never heard of that I know of. But it's a small enough exaggeration that it shows that this idea is both plausible and relevant to me. It's plausible because many people do use telegraphs or the postal system, though perhaps more for practical reasons than the romantic sense of being in touch with your remote family. And it's relevant because I started thinking about societies that have strong institutions of trust, law, etc. after reading The Secret of Our Success, and got curious enough to learn more about social organization. My interest wasn't limited to the specific issue of whether high trust/\xe2\x80\x8blaw institutions can help sustain rapid technological growth. What interests me are the principles at play in societies which have developed those institutions, and what good those principles tend to do.</p><br><p>As a test case, let's choose the norms of trust, law and property. What good do those do?</p><br><p>It is difficult to get an answer to this question without a general theory of sociological phenomena which explains why certain traits tend to be the norm whenever a given society can afford them. When there are tradeoffs between different traits, which traits tend to win?</p><br><p>But since this is not a post about a particular society of interest, let's choose one in-the-know.</p><br><p><strong>(I) The Norm of Trust</strong></p><br><p>All societies of humans to the extent that we can explain it are built on trust. Even in societies who don't make explicit use of explicit trust laws, the existence of trust in the first place is sufficient to establish basic economic behavior. Imagine a hunter-gatherer society where the hunters live off the prey they kill, but don't share the deer. Every hunter is individually rational\xe2\x80\x94they all want the deer, and would like it if all the others shared the deer equally with them. But in practice, there are not enough deer to go around and the best alternative is for the hunters to band together to pool their efforts until the next successful hunt when everyone gets their turn again.</p><br><p>Another example of this principle comes from the Roman empire. In the Roman system, all citizens were granted citizenship and the right to demand from other citizens the things they needed such as food or shelter. However, it was considered to be bad manners for a citizen to demand services he wasn't entitled to. If I know that you have all the bread and my back is aching, I might ask for some to help me. But if I really need bread I'll ask for a loan. That way if I'm mistaken as to whether you have some bread, I don't risk spoiling your hospitality by looking too greedy.</p><br><p>In other words, the Roman way was to accept that we all had different rights, but we all respected the rights of others the same way. If I ask for bread and you can't pay me, you can't just decide someone else is making more bread and take their stuff.</p><br><p>Somehow, though, we know how to apply these principles in a less self-interested way to other humans than to other humans' property, something I would call trust.</p><br><p><strong> (II) The Norm of Law.</strong></p><br><p>The norm of law is the norm that all disputes be settled according to rules, no matter who the players are. In some ways this is the default: humans seem to be built to deal with other humans with laws. Even animals. Even plants. Even some non-living things if they are sufficiently similar enough to us and powerful enough to pose a threat.</p><br><p><strong>A few rules about this:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>The rule always applies in the moment, never after. If you were to kill every man in your country but leave a certain woman alone, she can always claim that she was raped and demand compensation. If this ever happened at all, you were the villain in a story instead of an honorable man.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>No exceptions: even if the law doesn't usually apply in a particular class of circumstances, its <em>existence</em> is enough to establish the rule. For example, in most legal systems, an individual who steals a thing worth less than a certain value is presumed to be a bad guy. But under our present legal system, when you are caught and try to hide anything worth more than $1000 and everything you stole was worth $0... it's hard to get away. At minimum, you'll lose your gun permit.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In many modern legal systems, this rule is only partially effective. If you steal and are convicted, you can always appeal to "extenuating circumstances", which are often interpreted as "you're a terrible person and we should hurt you as much as possible". "But I didn't actually steal the things\xe2\x80\x94there were witnesses and I didn't get any hint from them that they might lie. So what about the "faulty" ones? That didn't count as a defense either?"</li>
</ul><br><p>We're also reminded at this point that there are two separate norms here. There is the norm that rules must be followed and be enforced, no matter who you are and no matter what goes on. But then there's the norm that you should actually stick to the rule you would if someone in your position were in your place.</p><br><p>If you're the sort of person to get into a shouting match with a foreigner and insult him for not understanding the law or breaking it in the appropriate fashion, then you're also the sort of person who shouldn't get to steal a bike from someone else just because he forgot to lock it up. On the other hand, if you can somehow find another way to steal the bike, for example by pretending to be someone who is legally authorized to do things on others' property, the law has to change before you can really say what you did was correct.</p><br><p>The Norm of Law and the Norm of Trust are both examples of sociological principles which apply not just to societies like our own, but to all human societies that are able to afford them. The only reason we think about rules-of-behavior is that many humans would benefit from it, but it doesn't mean that it's the <em>most</em> beneficial arrangement. After all, what works in one society could be considered a crime in another society. But if it works most of the time, most societies tend to adopt it.</p><br><p><strong>III. The Norm of Property.</strong></p><br><p>In all societies there are norms about how we can own things. It sounds almost tautological, but "all societies have norms about how we own things" sounds a lot more interesting than "no societies have norms about whether it's appropriate to steal things". In fact, "no societies have the Norm of Trust" is <em>not</em> nearly as tautological as I tried to make it sound.</p><br><p>So, what does the Norm of Property mean, and why does it exist?</p><br><p>It all comes back to the original question. Some people might have stuff like bread and others might not. If there are not enough bread-for-others, you can either steal bread from others or ask someone else for it. But what does the norm of property mean on top of that? Why does it seem like any society with enough bread for more than one person can afford to have a norm of giving more bread to others?</p><br><p>Property is, after all, a scarce resource. If you are rich enough, you might have people who have much more than you do. If you are willing to ask others for food, some of the people in your neighborhood might have enough food to go around for more people than they have. If you aren't willing to ask for help, then you have to either be selfish and eat, or else have your property stolen from you.</p><br><p>But wait! There's more than one value of property. In societies of trust, the norm for property is to distribute it in proportion to how valuable it is. But if you are the sort of person for whom the norm that there should be enough bread, you have the right to demand that others share their bread. So there aren't just different norms of property, there are different norms of trust!</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
