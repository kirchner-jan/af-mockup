(The correction doesn't say for which parts it should be terrible, because I haven't had time to proofread. If you can't find the error on your own, feel free to send me a message and I'll edit the post to correct it.)

How can we know if what's going on is in fact a good model and should be applied to more important problems?</p><br><p>Nurture Assured: Rethinking How Children Learn, by Bruce Locke, offers a neat little parable to help us answer that question.</p><br><p>A biologist named Alice is playing with three different colored balls, which bounce around when you push them and occasionally produce an egg. She's studying how these balls interact and trying to understand the rules. This is her first day.</p><br><p>Her colleague Bob is very impressed with the balls, and decides to run an experiment. He uses a piece of paper with a picture drawn on it to make the three balls interact in interesting ways and convince them to produce eggs.</p><br><p>Soon a friend Carol is along. She understands the experimental theory and is excited to see what comes of it, and Bob teaches her the whole set of rules. Alice doesn't like Carol at all, and is very suspicious of her. Can someone from another culture really be trusted to run an experiment on something this personal and private?</p><br><p>This ends up as a huge battle between Alice and Carol. Bob is trying to use what he believes are very reasonable experimental procedures to try to convince them to use a different perspective on the system he's been playing with. Alice has her belief that everything she's reading is correct. Carol has her belief that Bob is wrong. So they're both reading a lot of things they disagree on.</p><br><p>The problem with the experiment isn't that they disagree. It's that Alice thinks Bob is trying to convince her to do something wrong. From her perspective, there's only one option – accept what Bob tells her. And the more Bob tries to tell her, the longer their conflict lasts, and the longer it keeps hurting the system. Therefore, she doesn't want to agree that Bob's methods could work on anything else.</p><br><p>Bob tries harder. He comes up with fancier stories. He's actually trying to convince her that he can help people. If she would just let him try the experiment, Carol might be able to produce eggs too.</p><br><p>So she and Bob go off together and try to persuade Carol that she's wrong. Meanwhile, Carol continues to believe there's only one thing going on in the system – that she knows the experimental procedures better than Alice does, and doesn't need to listen to Alice.</p><br><p>After a while, Bob and Carol work in harmony together, and the balls all produce eggs like they should. The story ends with a big victory for both sides, and the biologist Alice realizing that she's wrong about so much of the situation – that children aren't supposed to listen to her, and even when they should listen, she shouldn't listen to them.</p><br><p>I like this parable because I feel the same way. I feel like most people in the world are very wrong about how to be moral, how to treat others, how to think, what to believe, what to want, what to believe about things, what to believe in order to be more successful, how to learn things, what to do with your time as a kid, what to do as a teenager, and probably other things too that I'm not thinking of. So I try to find the people that aren't trying to convince me of something I just don't think I can accept. I try to find groups of friends I like a lot, and learn to live in peace with the group as a whole, even when I agree with some but not all members.</p><br><p>II.</p><br><p>I don't <em>like</em> Nurture Assures, and you should read it anyway. I'm sure you will.</p><br><p>First off, it's a good parable. The science is correct and relevant (although I want to stress that there are a few things the book leaves out, and a few things the science doesn't even consider), and it's a good analogy to some issues that I've seen among my own friends and family. I'm sure it will have a lot of good material for you on the topics it discusses, and I'm sure you feel as confused as Alice before you get a chance to do any of the science.</p><br><p>Secondly, it's a <em>short</em> book at 160 pages. I was able to read it all in one sitting, and it's the shortest book I can think of that isn't a textbook. No book I know of claims to provide as much useful information in as few pages as Nurture Assorted can in 160. I was kind of surprised to see that.</p><br><p>Thirdly, it's not just another book about children and their learning. It's a much more important book than that. One theme of the book is the need to take scientific findings seriously. It's almost a rallying cry.</p><br><p>The book is about the experimental methodology of developmental psychological studies in general. The studies get interesting because we don't quite <em>know</em> those methodological procedures, and some of them contradict each other. For example, if you train people to perform better on the mental rotation task by showing them a diagram of a spiral, they will then fail a much more difficult spatial rotation task where you can't visualize anything. What's going on? </p><br><p>Developmental psychologists have theories. Some theories say that training increases how many people's attention can concentrate on one thing, and some others that it improves the ability to plan ahead, both of which can increase intelligence. But the experimental studies don't always lend much weight to these theories.</p><br><p>There are some techniques that work almost every time, and some that work rarely or not at all. There are some tasks that all young people do well, and then some that older people do better. There are some people who are good at learning some tasks more quickly than other people. There are some that can be trained to do better by being more motivated and engaged, other people that need a lot of sleep, others that don't. And of these contradictory and contradictory experimental findings, some are more important than others for a general theory of learning. Sometimes it's hard to know which.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
