</ul><br><p>Crossposted from the EA forum.</p><br><p>[Summary: Justice has two sides.] </p><br><p>The Scales of Justice.</p><br><p>In The Art of Strategy Noah Smith describes two important principles as follows:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The first principle is that your opponent's behavior is a useful source of inferences about what his mind looks like\xe2\x80\x94at least to the extent that you know how your opponent thinks he would act in given circumstances. The second principle is that your opponents' behavior is a source of inferences <em>about</em> your opponents' minds.&gt; To use your opponent's behavior to learn about what he values (what makes him happy, what frustrates him, what satisfies him, what he would do in a new set of circumstances), you should reason about his behavior within the constraints he has placed over it. To use your opponent to learn about what <em>he</em> would do, you should reason about what he might do given different constraints (the possible range of outcomes for which he might value his behavior) and/\xe2\x80\x8bor a better understanding of his mind.A consequence of these two principles is that people take actions and strategies which optimize not only their own reward, but also the potential reward of their adversary that arises from their opponent's reaction. They also consider potential punishment actions and strategies if things do not work out in their favor. This post will start with a description of the two principles; I will proceed to explain how both principles and consequences can manifest in different ways, some of which may be counterintuitive.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The scales of justice may be in place in brains.</p><br><p>Two examples.</p><br><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p><br><p>A person who takes a job at a casino because they want to gamble will be more likely to be generous towards their coworkers and will make greater effort to do good work on the job. This person expects to benefit from this action.</p><br><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p><br><p>One of the reasons why it is not always a good idea to offer to pay another's personal expenses is that you might feel like you are taking advantage of them, and this might influence their perception of you negatively. However, even if you never offer to pay someone else's personal expenses, some people will be negatively influenced by your decision-making process.</p><br><p>As an individual, it might be a very bad idea to act in ways that will affect the perception and values of other individuals. It is possible to come up with examples in these areas, but I've only been able to generate two, which might be representative.</p><br><p><strong>Suit your opponent</strong>. </p><br><p>Suppose a person is an outspoken atheist who has a number of values which conflict with the values of a group of people around them, who mostly believe in God. The person might find it unwise to express their belief in atheism in the way that they would like people around them to behave. They may even want to avoid saying or communicating anything related to religious topics. The person would do very well by communicating their values in a way that would satisfy the group of people around with whom they want to be part of the in-group.</p><br><p><strong>Be consistent</strong>.</p><br><p>If an employee of a casino finds it in their self-interest to gamble, and to do so they often play on slot machines with lower expected values for casino operators (due to a desire for personal gain), they will have a more difficult time justifying a decision to stop gambling entirely, as would happen in response to personal incentives such as gambling as a hobby. </p><br><p>In both examples, in one direction the decision maker seems to be optimizing for their own utility (being nice and consistent with values that they already agree with), and the other appears to be doing something different from the one that maximizes their own utility (satisfying their own values in their decisions). </p><br><p><strong>The Scales of justice are not opposed</strong>.</p><br><p>This principle applies in both examples. In each case, whether you decide to take a job at a restaurant or not, you are maximizing the expected value of your own reward <em>while at the same time</em> taking the best actions that you can given the constraints imposed by your opponent.</p><br><p>A person that maximizes their utility given the constraints imposed on them by society at large is still acting according to their own values, and acting to maximize the expected utility of their opponent's reaction is still an action that attempts to further the potential reward of the opponent that they know they are competing against.</p><br><p>The Scales may be at play in every decision and it is unlikely that one will be "on the side" or "against the scales". The scales may be more present when we are in situations where there is social pressure. </p><br><p>Another consequence of this principle is that people's decision-making processes are more likely to have an anti-epistemic flavor. A person's values and preferences and preferences can shift and often do, and they may not have a full understanding of themselves, and therefore may have reasons not to try and get a full understanding of that in which they have value alignment. Therefore it may be better to accept a person's values as a given, and then use their values to attempt to figure out what they might decide for any given action. </p><br><p>The Screens of Justice.</p><br><p>Another way to understand what I have defined as the two principles of The Scales of the Justice is to consider something analogous to a screen. Every action has a set of constraints; a screen is a constraint. A screen of justice is a constraint with multiple possible outcomes as values. It is similar to a screen of values.</p><br><p>The two screens are at the same time the most useful and the least useful parts of the justice screen. The most useful part of the justice screen is where the player values a reward given his opponent's response, and the least useful part of the screen is where only the player is given feedback on his strategy.</p><br><p>The most useful part of a justice screen is the part at the scale of <em>the opponent's strategy.</em> The screen constrains the possible decision sets that are <em>compatible</em> that particular opponent.</p><br><p>The more useful part of the scale of the opponent's strategy is the part at <em>the player's strategy</em>. The player can see these constraints and act to optimize within them to maximize their own reward, or to satisfy the constraints to satisfy the values of the opponent.</p><br><p>On one side of a screen of justice, the scales of justice are fully optimized for the player's values. However, the more detailed information available to an adversary about each side of the screen of justice gives <em>both</em> sides of the scales more information to draw from than just one side. </p><br><p>As the adversary makes their strategy clearer, they will necessarily have to make it more specific, and this opens up the possibility for optimizing for <em>the opponent's</em> values rather than their own.</p><br><p>The two sides of the scale do not have to be perfectly opposed in terms of one's values. Indeed, the scales of Justice can be at the same time both more likely to be pro-epistemic than most in their values (the player values his opponent's values above his own), but also more likely to be anti-epistemics in terms of information that they convey about themselves.</p><br><p>The values that a player might choose to optimize for on each side can be quite different. For example, one player might be <em>consistent</em> over a large area of the possible range of outcomes to choose between. This person might value <em>their own choices above a majority vote</em>.</p><br><p>This person would rather be on the side for any given vote, but could be tempted by an outcome for which they would have a small share of the popular vote, and therefore can influence a larger share of the choice.</p><br><p>Another player on the other side may be indifferent between many possible value outcomes, but have a strong preference for <em>having the right to veto the outcome</em>. Therefore this player would prefer a situation in which if several outcomes have more than a majority of voters' preference for them, the outcome which has the most voters in favor, with a majority being less than half the number of votes. </p><br><p>The Scale of the Opponent's values.</p><br><p>One of the two scales of justice may more than likely be aligned more closely with its opponent's values than either side of that scale is aligned with one's own values. </p><br><p>Another possible consequence of the two principles is that they imply that <em>any</em> set of values will have someone supporting them and others opposing them. While this may not hold in some cases (such as in a democracy, where there is a relatively clear choice between different value points which is not often the case in practice), it is still possible that the person on one side of a given piece of the scale of justice has more <em>in common</em> with another person on the other side than these two sides have in common with each other. Therefore, it becomes more likely that there is <em>some</em> set of values which a person supports over a particular value set that they also support to a lesser degree.</p><br><p>A person does not have to hold exactly the opposite values than another as to be on other side of the scales. A person may be on opposite sides of the scales (of justice) without having values which are exactly opposed to each other. This concept of one's values being more opposed to values that one disagrees with has implications for a person's epistemology:</p><br><p>The scales may be at the same table with one's values.I may agree with some of your values, but you seem to have values I oppose, and it comes down to a choice between my values and yours.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
