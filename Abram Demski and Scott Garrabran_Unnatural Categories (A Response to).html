</ul><br><p><em>(Content warning: Category theory)</em></p><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p>Abram Demski and I had a long email conversation a little over a year ago about meta-level concepts, about the difference between talking about "mathematics" vs "number theory," and other examples of the difference between talking at the object level vs the meta level. If you haven't yet, I highly recommend it; we exchanged a few more paragraphs than we think is usual.</p><br><p>Since then, the conversation has largely fizzled out. In particular, a recent post of Abram's convinced me that Abram and I had some fundamental disagreements about natural categories. I'm excited to try to flesh out what I saw as the disagreement. At present, I'm still confused, but I hope that I'll be able to flesh out the disagreement by the end of the sequence.</p><br><p>Here is my outline for this sequence.</p><br><p>This sequence is about natural categories. A key part of the sequence will be the difference between natural and non-natural categories (a distinction we have been using for quite a while now). But beyond that, I'll basically be exploring various definitions of a natural category and comparing these to the definition of a non-natural category I gave in this post.</p><br><p>The basic idea will be something like, "a natural category is roughly the category that comes up in our intuitions when we think about mathematics." To be precise, I use the term 'natural' loosely; I won't be arguing that everything that people might think of as a 'natural category' would in fact be a 'natural category.'" But what I mean, as a heuristic, is "the category that comes up when someone thinks about mathematics."</p><br><p>I'll be doing a bit of defining my way through this definition. First I'll talk about intuitions about natural categories, and then I'll try to spell out the argument. After that I will discuss how I would define some technical objects like quivers and operads according to my informal definition of natural categories, and compare these to some alternatives (in particular, the Cartesian frame definition of natural categories). I'll probably be including my definition of quivers &amp; operads in this sequence, because I want to present a bunch of examples. Also, I haven't figured out a great way to do the quiver examples, and I expect they'll be easier to follow with the definition laid out in this sequence.</p><br><p>The sequence will be broken up into smallish chunks, hopefully around a single idea or a small collection of important definitions. I don't know how that will work out, but that's what I have in mind for the structure.</p><br><p>Below, I'll state my definition of a natural category, my definitions of "countable categorical" and "finitary categorical," and a few other things.</p><br><p>Natural Categories</p><br><p>What's a natural category, and why care about them? Why do we want to have a category with the nice properties we know of?</p><br><p>First, if we define a category as a "directed poset with a bottom element, closed under finite products" (or equivalently, any set of objects with a least element and a canonical morphism from the bottom element to any other object), then that is essentially all of categories\xe2\x80\x94all of them are just a special case of a directed-poset category with a bottom element and closed under finite products. But what do we do with other categories? What are categories, <em>in general</em>?</p><br><p>Why is it useful to have <em>any</em> category at all? What does it even mean to have a category X at <em>all</em>? What is an X? Is there a better definition? I don't know. But having a category at all seems quite useful, so it's definitely worth trying to define it.</p><br><p>Natural categories are an incredibly general concept. I'd guess that it would be a good category theory textbook to explain a definition of "natural categories" and then to ask for the definition of a natural functor out of such-and-such category. We might need to spell out what it means to "be a natural category," but given the other definitions in that textbook, this would be straightforward\xe2\x80\x94and hopefully a reasonably common textbook in ten years would have a complete definition.</p><br><p>As a rough-but-useful heuristic, "natural categories" are the category that comes out of our intuitive understanding of math, as described in Section "Natural Categories."</p><br><p>However, a category is more, than an abstract thing. A category can have many layers of definition on top of all the properties listed above.</p><br><p>Some of the more-important properties of a category may be:</p><br><ul>
<li>Countability. If a category C has an infinite number of morphisms between any two objects in the category, then C must be uncountable.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Countability (up to isomorphisms). Given two morphisms between two objects of the same type, there can only be countably many morphisms between those two objects. In other words, C must be <em>countably</em> categorical.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Finite. Any collection of objects of the same category C must have a bottom object. So C must be finite, in the sense that we can order all the objects of C by height. This fact is very useful. For example, when we show that C is Cartesian, that is, we show that C must be finite.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Biextensional Equivalence. Two objects are biextensionally equivalent in the category C if there exists a set of morphisms between them such that for all choices of morphisms between the objects, we obtain the same result regardless of which morphisms we choose. This fact isn't very important to know about a category C, but it's a useful property to have. There are several ways of specifying this property.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Sub-Sums and Sub-Tensors. Given two natural categories C and D, the tensor product and sum of their respective morphism sets (e.g. C\xe2\x8a\x97D) should be equal to C\xc3\x97D. This is a useful fact to know, but you're not supposed to think "homotopy equivalent" or "bicategorial equivalent" unless you already know how to think about category products and sums.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Homotopy Equivalence. The sets of morphisms from two given objects should be structurally isomorphic to each other, in the sense of homotopy equivalence of category theories. This is a potentially very useful fact, but again you're not supposed think "homotopic" unless you already have some notion of what it means to be homotopic.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Cartesian Frames. Given an ordered pair of natural categories (C,D) which is not a biextensional equivalence of C and D, C\xc3\x97D should be a <em>natural category</em> in its own right. A natural category should obey similar axioms to a commutative-diagonal cartesian frame (section 2.1 of the Cartesian Frames paper). A category with these axioms should be called a finite category (as opposed to a countably categorical category that obeys much weaker axioms).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Isomorphic. For the objects and morphisms of a category to be identical in some sense, it doesn't have to be isomorphically\xe2\x80\x94I could have multiple identical objects and one morphism between them. I could also have one object with multiple distinct morphisms to it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Embeddable. Given a categorical equivalence biextensional between two categories C and D with the same objects and morphisms, it should be possible to embed one category into the other. This condition is not directly stated in terms of morphisms but does seem closely connected\xe2\x80\x94it seems like an important condition. (More precisely, if I know that C is embeddable and D isn't, then the category D must be Cartesian, since C is not; if D might or might not be a category, then I <em>either</em> know its type or know C's type, and the only possible cases for knowing C's type are knowing it's not a <em>simple</em> category and knowing that it's a Cartesian.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Simple. Since a category can have many objects and morphisms between them, the objects and morphism sets should not get infinitely big.</li>
</ul><br><p>There are a few more properties I feel are likely to be useful. The last thing I feel like I'd need would be a definition of "categorical," since that's one of the main things I meant by "natural category." But if I have to spell that out, I might define: something is a category if we can order all of the morphisms from a given object, and also order all of the objects, and then there exist some morphisms h0,h1,h2,... such that for all morphisms between the given object and some object g, g0g1g2...hi\xe2\x88\x921g\xe2\x88\x92i would make sense. That is, a category is something where we can order everything in the category and we can also order everything in the morphism sets by composition. This is a pretty simple condition, I expect that most reasonable categories have this property.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
