<p>Although most of the claims about the <em>first</em> successful aircraft flight date vary, the consensus seems to be that "it took place somewhere around 1903." One prominent source is the famous French aviation expert Gabriel de Broyer d'Aubr\xc3\xa9gondis's 1909 work, <em>A History of Aeronautics and its Developments</em>, which claims it "the first airplane, <em>made in 1900 or 1901,</em>" but at least one historian found that the "first airplane flight," according to d'Aub\xc3\xa9rondis, wasn't even fully flightworthy until late March or early April 1903.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Another source is the 1919 report, "The First American Airplane: The Wright Aeroplane" (<em>The Great Illustrated History of Aviation Volume I</em>). This gives 1903 as the date of the "first" flight\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the flight for the first time in 1903. Here is a quote from the report:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>...There is very, very little difference in the appearance of the Wright and Curtiss machines with few if any minor changes, except in the use of the rudder on the Wilbur Wright machine. The Wilbur Wright machine will, at every rise, automatically come into a true circle, and the Wright glider with its automatic wing-flapping will practically never stop going in or out of the air. It will travel not over a quarter of a mile, and then when it is going more than that, it will do a lot of turning. The Wright machine is almost as good as it is known as a flying machine, both in its aerodynamical and the mechanical aspects. (The Wright patent on the rudder, although it does increase the speed by a certain amount, is not entirely satisfactory.) The Wright engine is of some twenty horsepower and it will carry two passengers. It will rise to a height of one or two hundred feet.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>(Although note that this date, by both these reports, is more nearly in line with the other sources cited above, which generally give a date between 1900 and 1902.)</p><br><p>In case you find this all a bit too much, you can Google Wikipedia! They give 1903 as the first "successful" flight date on the first page they go to. This is true for me too\xe2\x80\x94I just did so a few minutes previously. The Wikipedia page doesn't have a "Successful flight" date listed; it does give the date of the publication of the Wright patent, March 23, 1903. However, it says this:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>While in the United States, the Wright brothers held a press conference in which it was claimed that they would make their "Flyers" fly within a couple of days, an official investigation into the Flyer would not determine whether such a flight had taken place in 1903 before the publication of the patent on 23 March 1903.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>(This may be an argument for the date 1900 or 1902 having priority, as suggested in an earlier post.)</p><br><p>What does all this mean? It doesn't really mean anything. The date of the first flight might have been any of these dates: 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906... (the "1900" case is still controversial, as I discussed at the end of that post, as well as in a comment by Nisan_Strum below)</p><br><p>An examination of two primary estimating methods for the date(s) of the first successful aircraft flight</p><br><p>I looked in more detail at two primary sources concerning the "first successful flight" for aviation: Gabriel de Broyer de Aubr\xc3\xa9gondis' <em>History of Aeronautic Developments</em>, and a 1919 report by the National Museum of the Future called, "The First Flying Machine to Reach The Stratosphere of Flight:"</p><br><p>https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.nps.gov/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bnfoa,_assets/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8buploads/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe-first-successful-flight-report0.pdf</p><br><p>https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthehistoryofflight.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwp-content/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8buploads/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b2018/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b06/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bThe-First-Successful-Aerial-Flight-1918.pdf</p><br><p>I found de Broyer de Ubrensondis' work to be very clear, concise, and even entertaining and enjoyable to read. It offers a comprehensive history of all "flight" machines up to its time. What it does not consider when writing this history is the distinction and potential importance of "flight" machines <em>before</em> the Wright Flyer, and indeed, it is very clear that the Wright Flyer is the first "flight" machine. (This is also clear from the "1900" controversy described at the end of the earlier post which I discussed there.)</p><br><p>The 1919 report is a 1919 report by National Museum of the future (NMMF), and is actually quite long and comprehensive\xe2\x80\x94you can find the whole thing here. It does not try to summarize anything, nor summarize the history of flight in general, but covers the first "flying machine" to succeed. This is interesting because the author seems to be trying to determine <em>exactly</em> when the first successful aircraft was made\xe2\x80\x94and he comes as close to a clean and precise conclusion as I've seen.</p><br><p>Other historical estimates and their merit</p><br><p>In the comments to the earlier post I mentioned that I couldn't find a <em>single</em> source that made very clear and confident claims that the <em>first</em> viable aircraft was actually built or flew in 1900. The same goes for the claim that the first flying machine was built in 1902 (or even in 1905). Wikipedia too, for that matter, is generally pretty clear that it wasn't until 1903 that we had first viable flying machine (see this discussion of the Wikipedia page, as well as the NMMF report linked above and the Wikipedia page on the First Flight Controversy). Wikipedia generally agrees with Wikipedia that the Wright Flyers won the 1903 Wright-vs-Benson-Bentley Contest, but then also states that the Wright Flyerr was not <em>first</em> successful at flight until the NMMF Report says so:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>An important piece of evidence is provided by the official contest rules. The rules stipulate that a machine shall "not be judged by the Court as unworthy of its place in the record of the first flight, on the principle that to count toward the record, the machine must have been actually flown before the flight recorded." The NMMF Report declares that "The Wilbur Wright Flyer [was] not a flight for the first American" (as it had not at that time been demonstrated to fly anywhere in America), although it clearly is part of the record.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>And then we come the controversial arguments about the 1900 date. In this comment, Nisan_Stum, a historian, made the following comment:</p><br><p>I'm not sure what you mean by "1898" is not part of the record? My understanding is that by "1898," you simply mean "before 1903." For example, it's true that the first successful flight (if it was in fact a flight) is generally taken to have occurred before 1903, and almost all sources agree with this ("The Wright Flyer, 1903"). But this is not really a date by which the Wright Flyer <em>qualitatively</em> differed from other flying machines (in terms of the flight history); it's merely a date on which the Wright Flyeer <em>qualitatively</em> differs from other flying machines. In this case, the flight, which is generally taken as the "first" successful flight, is taken as having occurred after 1903; it isn't a date on which such a flight <em>qualitatively</em> happened.</p><br><p>(Note that his statement seems more ambiguous, and perhaps <em>wrong</em>, but I'm unable to interpret it as meaning what he seems to mean since I do not know more about the context in which he wrote it.)</p><br><p>To me, the above commentary was very clear and understandable. However, most other sources disagree with this, especially Wikipedia, which lists many sources saying the Wright Flyer flew in 1900. In fact, Wikipedia makes Wikipedia's own statement sound not only reasonable, it also makes it seem that Wikipedia <em>believes in</em> the 1900 interpretation\xe2\x80\x94the claim that the Wright Flyerer flew before 1903. So to make sense of all of this, Nisan_strum seems to believe that the 1900 date is plausible, possible, and actually reasonable:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>Why would anyone argue about anything other than what happened\xe2\x80\x94especially when they all agree on the first manned flight?</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>However, the most important question to ask is: <em>why do some people seem to treat the 1900 claim as being implausible (at least prior to this article)</em>? This is the question that I ask here.</p><br><p>Conclusion</p><br><p>I want to be clear on one thing: Even if someone has <em>evidence</em> in favor of a 1900 or 1902 date, and you don't see it, it's OK. If everyone around you agrees (or even claims) that the Wright Flyr was in fact the first viable flying machine, then the 1900 argument does not hold. I certainly agree with this. However, I do not think it is <em>reasonable</em> to assume that it also necessarily holds before one has seen the evidence.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
