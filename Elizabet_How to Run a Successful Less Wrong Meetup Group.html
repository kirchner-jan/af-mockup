</ul><br><p>I work in software, and also in general run a lot of other peoples' lives. People come to me to ask what the best way is to organize my meetups.</p><br><p>This is a post for anyone else who might be interested in becoming the sort of person who can run meetup groups. Since the beginning I have been taking meetups pretty seriously. I have a sense that I'm not doing a terrible job, but that I'm on track to need more deliberate attention. (There's been one or two events that involved a significant amount of effort, which makes sense since each one had its own specific benefits.)</p><br><p>Below are the ten major ways I think meetups can be awesome, what sorts of things I've been doing to run meetups well, and why I think this is the best path forward.</p><br><p>A) Finding and Training An Advisor</p><br><p>It's possible for the majority of initial meetups to just bounce off. This can even be a good thing if it makes people realize that they aren't cut out to be a group organizer. And while I've been in this camp a few times, I've been in it on the wrong occasions. (I even once had the exact opposite reaction; "I <em>can</em> host groups!" I would announce in advance, or to some others in advance, and be excited about my own prospects of organizing. I had just become friends with the person I expected to coordinate it with in advance, and he was the only one with enough of an existing social network to even try it! The rest of the other attendees seemed to genuinely think it was a terrible idea; some of them were surprised I wanted to try it. That was the day I decided it wasn't for me)</p><br><p>The most important thing in the world when running a meetup isn't who's on the line. It's what's in control of the person on the line.</p><br><p>When I first started going to meetups I thought I could just find and introduce new people to each other. "We'll invite them to hang out with us again", and maybe we'd be new friends. But I overestimated my abilities in advance, and underestimated how much they would dislike me. I underestimated how weird some of them would find the whole meetup thing too. I underestimated how many of them would have to get involved in order to help their friend and I solve a problem. I made bad assumptions about how much time I would have to spend at most meetups.</p><br><p>In the end it took around eight months to meet everyone I knew and know well in the Bay Area. And I still only hang out with people about 10% of the time. I've gotten quite a lot done in that time with the little time I <em>have</em>, including running seven meetups, of which one was a formal event. (Even the formal event took six months after it started, because I'd gotten it on the wrong days with the wrong people, and had to fix that before it got good.)</p><br><p>And this is a very rough approximation; I may know who the people are I didn't meet, if they were only in the same room one day at a time, but not what their relationships even were with me or who they met with more.</p><br><p>This process is also the fastest way to have social control; it costs me about five minutes, a lot of which being "let's hang out" costs nothing but another five minutes. It costs ten to actually coordinate a meetup, because I do have to do a lot of communicating. Once I find a group that suits, I can go from "you need to meet with this person or other to run the meetup here" to "this person and I are going to be organizing this meetup." To me it looks like a lot of effort, but to people already invested it can look like "you just came to meet people." And then when you get around to it, they can take all the joy out of it.  (If you are an organizer and this problem sounds strange to you, please speak up!)</p><br><p>B) Managing a MeetUp Group</p><br><p>If I had to do it again, I would work to make sure that the people who were going to be the ones organizing meetups saw the potential in me as a host.</p><br><p>A lot of people get the wrong impression of me, because my blog posts can be quite long and I keep saying "I'm not a rationalist, I'm just an organizer," (even though I'm part of the rationalist group). And then people get the impression that I have a lot of opinions, and I have a lot opinions. One of my main intentions with this blog is to convince people I'm not as bad at thinking as they think I am, or as the average other person is. Also to give people a way to see if they can have control of what they are and aren't getting wrong about. So I have a bunch of opinions, but I mostly don't think about it. And even if I did I mostly wouldn't talk about them much, since those tend to be the things that are most vulnerable to bad takes. I mostly want the audience to be getting things mostly right as a default assumption. That's mostly why my blog posts are mostly only a couple hundred words, my actual ideas don't run more than a few paragraphs.</p><br><p>Part of the reason this blog is so important to me (and to my readers) is because it tells people that I have skills. But I also need their endorsement for any specific thing I say. What are the things that seem reasonable to me? And what would you change about me if a reader told you you should change? (This is similar to asking advice on how to change for someone's benefit, but applied to a self)</p><br><p>A second part of this, that seems like it'd be useful for anyone, is that some ideas tend to be more fun for one or the other of us to have. I like discussing things with people who are better at explaining them than I am, and vice versa. (I also expect a lot of group decisions to have an effective amount of both, so that's one reason I'm ok with it, but I also think there's a lot of value in talking and sharing models)</p><br><p>To explain all of the advice at once, here's my list of common failure modes and solutions to help people avoid them.</p><br><ul>
<li>Not having strong mentors. Don't start out as having lots of mentors. I get asked by acquaintances to see if they could get me to come to dinner. People have said "I'll see you once, maybe twice, and then never talk to you" or "I'll see whether you come out to dinner with me at all."  These tend to come from acquaintances who don't really have social groups, who don't know what the group norms are, and don't have an easy way of finding more people to talk things through with them. I'm usually pretty good at figuring out the right approach to handle them, and I usually learn a lot from the person trying to be helpful, but it gets harder to give good answers over time.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Not being responsible for your own social situation. The problem with being "someone else's problem" is that it's easy to lose sight of what those problems are. Sometimes people don't know what they want, so they need to get it wrong the very first time. Sometimes they want different things from others, but aren't sure what to say to get people to understand the differences. Sometimes they are afraid that what they ask is weird and they'd be embarrassed being told no, and they're trying to figure out the best option in the moment. Sometimes their expectations are not explicit and some people may end up feeling embarrassed not meeting them, which makes it hard to fix later.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Failing hard when everything goes wrong. The hard failure mode is when problems never get fixed, because there's no way to fix them once you've done everything that needs to be done. This includes things like failing to make progress in meeting someone in person, getting off the first date with no good excuse, deciding it's too late to back out of meeting up and finding they were busy, etc.</li>
</ul><br><p>C) Running Events</p><br><p>For the few times I do have to run something that is more structured, things go much more smoothly. </p><br><p>It doesn't cost much to try out new things, like seeing what happens with an event format. You can get ideas and some feedback about things that are good, and some feedback on things that aren't good.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
