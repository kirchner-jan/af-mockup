</ul><br><p>It seems that the number of children that a Fields medalist often brings into the world follows a power law: at least one report I've seen is that a large majority of Fields medalists have more than 3 kids. The vast majority of researchers in a field, in other words, do not have large families.</p><br><p>I have a few hypotheses on how to account for this.</p><br><p>For people under 30, this makes sense: for most of history, childbirth was a significant life event in itself. Women in their late 20s had a couple children, and then another couple to wait for their children to age out. So in most history, there was a significant delay between reaching a certain level of achievement for a woman in their 20s, and having a couple kids. Thus, the people who have large families are mostly those who were <em>exceptions</em>\xe2\x80\x94those who could afford to delay their kids to gain experience in the field, or take a long time to become credentialed enough to bring up more kids in their own field.</p><br><p>Mathematical proofs, in particular, come very, very late on. In most cases, mathematicians start out as kids in their 20s. They don't get to the point of proving things until their 40s, at the earliest.</p><br><p>In fields that require more long term research, like physics, we see the same. This goes double if the field requires large investments in equipment, and so a young physicist with no technical debt needs to have a few kids to make the investment in a physicist.</p><br><p>In areas not well-suited to large households, like engineering/\xe2\x80\x8bdesign, there is a similar pressure towards high-quality research that is independent of the number of children produced. For example, in electrical engineering (one of my personal areas of expertise) most students do not have a garage or driveway, so you have to either work at home while you raise the kids, or move somewhere to afford your own home and kids. The same pressure does not apply to physics, where the number of children you can support at home is more readily available (though still not that many).</p><br><p>The obvious first guess for why we see a power law amongst Fields medalists is, of course, that Fields medalists get to <em>pick</em> which children to have. Not all of their children can be mathematicians, but presumably they can select out for having math-like children at a much higher rate than they can select for other traits. This can, in turn, be viewed as a form of selection bias: if you are more likely to pick a kid that happens to have math-like parents, and you are more likely than others to pick a kid who happens to have math parents, then this is a self-fulfilling prophecy\xe2\x80\x94you are more likely to <em>actually</em> get a Fields medalist, rather than someone else or no one at all.</p><br><p>But this is really a special case of the phenomenon of selective breeding and breeding to the extreme: humans are very good at doing that and selecting for traits they find appealing. There are a number of papers I've read arguing that this is how we got so many smart people and that this is how much of the variance in intelligence can be explained (on average, but some smart people definitely have more variance than other smart people. Also on average, but some of those smart people <em>like</em> being smart and it pays off!). This also seems like it would explain why the Fields medalists <em>themselves</em> would be selecting for math-like children, to a significant degree.</p><br><p>But is that a good model of the selection pressure at work? What if there's more going on than that? Perhaps there are actually other factors at play?</p><br><p>A few cases in fields &lt;-&gt;"less obvious than math"</p><br><p>One thing we can use to determine if there are more/\xe2\x80\x8bdifferent factors at play is to look at the distribution of children amongst the people <em>with</em> large families. I've looked for data on these, so here are some quick notes:</p><br><ul>
<li>In physics, Fields medalists tend to be less productive. Fields medalists have a mean age difference of 4.35 years (3.84 years average difference); while the overall population mean age difference is 4.18 years (3.79 years average difference). (Wikipedia: "The mean age difference in the population was 4.33 years in men and 4.49 years in women, significantly larger than in the Fields medalists (3.84 in men and 3.79 in women"), with very few people in the former having two children and none in the latter.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Fields medalists tend in general to make their biggest impact at earlier ages; the average age at when they make a significant mathematical breakthrough is ~28 years. By comparison, the general population averages ~32 years, with the vast majority of people making their first significant breakthrough by 40-50 years old. [See the following link where mathematicians are compared to physicists and they don't look at age at any other point: http://\xe2\x80\x8ben.wikipedia.org/\xe2\x80\x8bwiki/\xe2\x80\x8bTimeline_of_mathematics]</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Fields medal winners tend to have more than one child (average: 2) by comparison to other mathematicians (average: 0.66). For example, Fields medalist R. Langlands had 4 children. Fields medalist Wiles also had many children (4). Fields medalists are also more likely to divorce. Fields medalists had a 4% chance of divorce, whereas the baseline for people in general is 15%, which reflects higher divorce rates among people who are in their 20s rather than 40s.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Fields medal winning couples are, on average, older when they get married. Fields medalists tend not to be married in their 20s; they tend to get married in their 30s, on average, and the average age gap is ~6 years. (There are few or no cases where they marry in their 20s and then have less than 4 years gap)</li>
</ul><br><p>These points all fit well with selection bias. A person who gets married very late (in their 20s) also has a higher chance of having a later firstborn. But it's hard to see this factor alone explaining the large standard deviations, unless one also assumes some selective bias in who gets married in the first place.</p><br><p>But a few random notes can sometimes tell you more than you might assume.</p><br><p>Mathematicians, mathematicians. The ratio of mathematicians to non-mathematicians in the general population is around 1:3, with mathematicians being disproportionally women. By contrast, the corresponding ratio in the mathematicians' siblings is around 1:2. This suggests that women in math-like occupations, and women in math-adjacent occupations, may be somewhat more likely than other women to have kids. (There are a number of exceptions to this, of course\xe2\x80\x94it's not just math-like professions that have such a ratio. It also varies from profession to profession. For example, the ratio in law students to graduate students is around 3:1.) [If this doesn't make sense to you, the wikipedia page might help.]</p><br><p>On the other hand, this doesn't <em>prove</em> anything, at least for our purposes here.</p><br><p>Mathematically/\xe2\x80\x8btechnically oriented engineers and scientists are particularly likely to have children. This is partly an artifact of the way that they end up early in their careers, but it does suggest that there may be a lot of selective bias at play here. It's also possible that, say, people from math-adjacent professions have <em>more</em> kids on average to compensate for this relative lack of reproductive success.</p><br><p>Physics and engineering seem to be fields where there are substantial selective forces in favor of math-like kids, and so we would not expect this kind of bias.</p><br><p>The interesting part about physics is that if you look at their age at the first significant piece of math, it's ~10. Most other disciplines are more like ~4-5.</p><br><p>Are there other major types of engineers and scientists where the people with more mathematical children are <em>more</em> likely to have math-based children? One obvious class of candidates is chemists. Chemists seem to have some of the most strict gender/\xe2\x80\x8bsexual discrimination I can recall seeing. In chemistry, the female/\xe2\x80\x8blesbian/\xe2\x80\x8btransgender/\xe2\x80\x8betc representation is pretty typical and I don't personally think it reflects an unusually strong selection bias on the part of biologists, but it's definitely suggestive. If it proves anything it's <em>prima facie</em> suggestive that there's a selection bias present, and that it seems to be skewed in favor of math.</p><br><p>Another interesting comparison class to consider here is Nobel laureates, and the question of why math is so highly concentrated in physics and their immediate cousins. Many Nobel laureates come from math-adjacently orientated departments (I've heard FHI, CSER and FHI as examples, among other physics ones). And many mathematicians come from engineering-related orientated departments. On the other hand, I haven't investigated what the age distributions look like, and I imagine if I had it'd tell me something interesting about the selection biases present among them.</p><br><p>Fields medalists and Nobel laureates</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
