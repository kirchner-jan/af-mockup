<p><em>What if you have one project that you're doing for some amount of time and the opportunity comes along to not do it anymore? What do you do then? If you're the kind of person who thinks things through you would do the obvious thing. But most people don't. - Richard Hamming</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>Sunk cost fallacy is a common mistake in rationality. An opportunity to be more rational may be overlooked if you have already spent a lot of your resources, even if you know that it was a mistake to do so. Even when you know that it would be a rational thing to do, if you still fail to take it, you're doing it for irrational reasons. Why is sunk cost fallacious\xe2\x80\x94and why should we try to avoid it in our actions?</p><br><p>Consider the sunk cost fallacy in science, of course. When new scientific methods reveal new worlds, the old scientists sometimes get their feelings hurt, feel like they already spent their lives on it rather than getting involved in new research, and so refuse to change their opinions. If scientific method X produces new results Y, and scientists who had method X also find the new results Z, what does the new scientist do? If he or she has spent time and resources on method X, does he or she not have a right to expect to have done the investment pay off?</p><br><p>And consider sunk cost fallacy in general. Even when we don't act under an assumption that our effort will be meaningless, it still seems that the fact that we put so much effort in means that something worthwhile must be found. Suppose you invest 15 hours into an hour-long job interview. If someone else offers you the job, and you accept it, then you'd think you hadn't learned anything. But this is only the case if you didn't put in anything at all. If you're trying hard, then you're much more likely to find out later that the job is better than you first thought.</p><br><p>The sunk cost fallacy is important to us because of its implications for how we do business at different levels of a process: at the individual level, at the group level, and at the systemic level. But first I'll elaborate on the implications for doing individual science:</p><br><p>At the individual level, a sunk cost is often a <em>sign of an irrational and possibly ungrounded belief in one's abilities.</em> Suppose that you just spent a lot of time on a project. You know that it produced no results, but you know that you might have missed some subtle detail that could have produced results. You know that the task isn't too hard, the research isn't too complex, and so perhaps it just needs more time than you thought. You also know that it takes more time than you might estimate, but the initial effort must pay off in a different form later on. Maybe a better estimate would have been to put your efforts into another research topic that you feel more knowledgeable about, but you now think that a little extra research time could do even better. You know that you need to avoid being anchored by sunk costs; so you try to use a different technique for coming up with such estimates.</p><br><p>At the group level, a sunk costs is a sign of a need to avoid wasted effort. Suppose that researchers have been working on a project for a while, but all the time, new research methods have shown that a different research question is in fact most important of those working on the previous line of research. In this case, it would be a pity if the researchers continued working on old, useless lines, simply because they have already put in so much time into it. It would be more efficient to just shift into doing the new research instead.</p><br><p>Systemic sunk cost fallacy is sometimes thought of as a form of cargo cult science (an instance of the cargo culting phenomenon, in which cult members behave irrationally even when the desired behaviour is obvious in theory, because its is part of an overall scheme of behavior that serves a function similar to the one served by the desired behavior).  Even though the sunk cost fallacy is often not explicitly observed, if cult members do the right actions for the wrong reasons, it can be a sign that people are operating in a manner akin to the sunk cost fallacy: without taking into account the fact that the sunk cost is a sign of the need to be more rational, instead doing the same thing for the sake of tradition or some other such reason.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
