That's the _philosophical _work, e.g. the literature on first-order moral philosophy and moral psychology, and the corresponding work in meta-ethics, the related subfields of metaphysics and epistemology. In meta-ethics we find distinctions that philosophers have been making for a long time, such as between first-order and higher-order properties, between physical and non-physical properties, properties that are "part-in-a-whole" and properties that are "nonsubjective." We also examine the role of emotions and intuitions in ethics; the possible relevance of animal ethics to human ethics; and the possibility of moral enhancement, as well as moral luck. </p><br><p>There's a lot that I think is useful in this work. But what I see most often is the following type of argument:</p><br><p>Gavin de Becker wrote a book called <em>The Gift</em>, in which he argues that there really are human needs that are not met by most people, that can't be achieved via our current institutions, that we ought as a species to start thinking about. People are going to feel cheated, and resent the unfairness of these institutions and the lack of regard for them by modern life. <em>The Gift</em> is one of the most widely-reviewed, well-liked books of my time, and I see it promoted and defended by a lot of people of an intellectual bent. Some of them have even made a point of trying to introduce G.D.E.'s work to their friends.</p><br><p>And some of them, as you might expect (and you can read G.D. E.'s book to see why I might think so) have found G.D.  E.'s work completely offputting, and they will probably never speak of it again.</p><br><p><em>Some</em> readers may also be annoyed, but they may go ahead and talk about it anyway.</p><br><p>And some readers won't even notice the book until they run into some of these arguments, in which someone is defending G.D. "on philosophical grounds," or trying to introduce G., as de Becker is fond of saying, "by the time he gets around to me, he should have already taught them the concept."</p><br><p>What I see most of the time, in fact, is this:</p><br><p>Gavin A. de Becker claims that we have needs /\xe2\x80\x8b rights, in a very strong way (as well as an in-between claim that "modern people do not have needs as completely as G.D.) He argues that we should all recognize this, and that we should start treating it as something of a tragedy that modern people do not have the satisfaction of those needs that G.D. claims exist. </p><br><p>Some people get stuck in the first two sentences or so, and dismiss the book entirely. They may not even notice the rest of the book, and would never have read it before, so G.D. has failed to change their minds. For them, the book is just a bizarre idea from an unusual source, to be laughed off as if nothing had ever happened. </p><br><p>This is a bad sort of dismissal. For one thing, it's just not true: the rest of what G.D wrote is _not _at all bizarre or unlikely, and has indeed been discussed by at least one other scholar in the past fifteen years (Kamm). This is not, as I see it, exactly a fatal problem, but it is not insignificant. </p><br><p>For another thing, I don't think that dismissing the book on the grounds of "the book is really weird and I didn't see that coming" is helping the reader, or helping de Becker, who wrote it. G.D. would probably react very badly to the accusations that his book is just a strange little thing that no one else had read or noticed, which makes it sound more reasonable and respectable than it is. The alternative to this dismissal is being dismissive of something that is otherwise highly respected (but may be flawed) and not engaging with the rest of the work (but not engaging with the ideas that seem so strange to the critic), which is not a way to build a strong case against other views on the subject.</p><br><p>The alternative to this, I think, is for anyone who wants to get through to modern people that we should really look seriously at the needs of people who feel that some things are missing. This is one of those cases; it's very much a case of "we don't realize that we owe you something." The alternative to being dismissive is to _say something about it, _and also to engage with the rest of G.D.'s books and arguments, which are some of the strongest ones I have yet read on this subject of the need for recognition of those needs. </p><br><p>Of course, "We should have needs" is just a good enough way to say it without actually having to engage with all of the issues raised by this idea. That's like thinking "We should be more willing to die so we can have a chance to experience something" sounds like an interesting thought, and so you toss the problem out the window. But when you actually have a chance to engage with some of the literature discussing why people might be happier in the future if someone gave them more time on earth, and you say, "We <em>should</em> have such a thing!" and then you go off talking about quantum immortality, you're at least going to be having problems. Indeed, someone might wonder what you <em>did</em> think was a good reason for this person (who I am imagining to be a real person who has been in your head) to die. But I digress.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>My main point here is that we, as a species, spend a lot of energy talking about moral philosophy, whether in arguments among our peers about this particular topic of interest or among broader society; and a lot of this energy we devote to sorting through philosophical distinctions which can't really be <em>decided</em> or <em>justified:</em> whether we have needs, or whether we have rights, in a way that can't be settled even by empirical investigation.</p><br><p>There is a simple and in fact obvious conclusion:  We have both, and it's important that we understand that.</p><br><p>But this fact is itself the subject of considerable dispute, both among philosophers and among broader society. One of G.D.'s main takeaways from his book was that (paraphrasing) although it's possible for <em>some</em> people to be happy just by existing\xe2\x80\x94indeed, to have such a condition that I would consider the opposite of <em>need</em>\xe2\x80\x94it is <em>not</em> possible for anyone to be so <em>maximally happy</em> that their condition <em>excludes any other possibility</em> of suffering. This is a point of contention in the book (see chapter 4), but it is also a point that (as I'll discuss later in this sequence) gets repeated ad nauseum by de Becker and by some of his critics. One of those critics, David Enoch, makes it a point in his book <em>Does Moral Realism Require Moral Relativism</em> to claim that de Becker has it backwards:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>If we are committed to say that needs are as important as rights, then we should take seriously the idea that there must be very important needs that we can't or won't satisfy, and that therefore there must be important needs that are not moral rights for us.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>And once I try to think about it this way, it's easy\xe2\x80\x94_very_ easy\xe2\x80\x94to see how people might disagree about this.</p><br><p>De Becker will tell you about the needs that people have for love, respect, and friendship. And if these needs can be satisfied through institutions and social conventions, in which case do people really have any "rights" as opposed to getting what they want? Isn't this a very old debate that gets put into new words every time? Or, conversely, is this one of those cases where it is more useful to say "needs" than "rights" to make people engage?</p><br><p>Echoing what I said above, some people will say, "It's <em>obvious,</em> in this instance, that people shouldn't be held accountable for failing to satisfy their needs, if those needs can be satisfied by outside social institutions." To which another person answers: "That's not how it works! People who don't have their needs met by outside social institutions, will still <em>feel</em> cheated, but that doesn't mean they should therefore be given a right, a privilege, and immunity from punishment for not meeting those needs <em>in the future!</em>"</p><br><p>It's important to point out here that although we spend a lot of time arguing about rights in particular, the concepts we ultimately want to think about, and the concepts we ultimately have to live with, are not quite so divided, for reasons I'll discuss in Part X of this sequence, about the possibility of morally enhancing people (but really, this is a bigger subject that could be expanded upon and I'm getting ahead of myself already\xe2\x80\x94I should probably just stop writing now).</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
