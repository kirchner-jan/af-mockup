Qu.</em> <strong>34</strong>, No. 3 (1995): 633-636. I have put his name in the title, because this is a book with a lot of quotes from famous philosophers and he has written the best one. However, if you do not mind me quoting him I suggest skimming over.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"I have tried very hard to read the Bayesian literature. I have not made a list of the papers I have read, in fact, I have made a list of those I have not. In brief, I have read only three papers. Of these three, none contains Bayesianism, although I know from a very good source that Bayesianism is what these philosophers want to argue for... I am, then, left with at least two choices. Either philosophers are wrong about the subject, and Bayesianism is not in fact their way, or the arguments they rely on are wrong, and have been shown to be wrong; or their arguments are right, and because of their reliance on these wrong or false grounds I do not in fact believe what they say... (Of course it's possible that philosophers really believe in Bayesianism or the subject they claim to be interested in, and are using a particular way of arguing, with these as noncentral members of the audience who know less about the subject). But this is hardly likely."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I found this quote interesting because I don't feel like I believe it when philosophers say that they care about logical consistency, but also care about what they say because it agrees with the evidence. I am tempted to say that philosophers care about logical consistency over and above the evidence.</p><br><p>And then I have thought of a more subtle way to interpret what they feel: philosophers care about logical coherence, and they care about the evidence because it agrees with coherent hypotheses.</p><br><p>For example, consider the way in which people in the bayesian community try to persuade people that coherent theories of rationality are true. Here's Steve Rayhawk:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"The rationality of a single agent consists of the properties that the agents rational planning algorithm assigns to the set of available options. But it is not sufficient to observe that an individual has a particular rational planning algorithm, to conclude that its behavior is rational. A further observation is required: how well does the evidence it perceives in the world support the hypothesis that this agent is implementing the stated reasoning algorithm, and how probable is this theory given what we know already about the agent and the environment? Even if we can find out the stated reasoning algorithm of an agent, it is not sufficient, by itself, to conclude that the agent is actually reasoning according to that algorithm; after all, the algorithm could be incomplete, internally incoherent, not logically coherent, and so on. So what we need to evaluate an agent's rationality is the whole of its beliefs, not just the stated reasoning algorithm it employs in carrying out its behavior."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Or suppose someone claims that they have discovered the secret of "Bayesianism", as described by John Norton and Richard Jeffrey. They say:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"Bayes' Theorem constitutes the axioms and theory of inference of the most elegant form in all of mathematics and can serve as the foundation of a modern theory of probability. No one has succeeded in deducing probabilities in a rigorous way." They explain that Jeffrey is the inventor who came up with Bayes' Theorem and that this theory contains the whole theory of probability.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Then they explain why Jeffrey's approach is not useful in practice:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>It's easy enough to see that any particular equation of the form P(F) = E(X|F) P(E) is not likely to be useful in practice if one does not already have a background in Bayesian reasoning. Jeffrey had this in mind when he said that Bayes' Theorems serve to reveal Bayesian reasoning, not to prescribe Bayesian techniques. Although Jeffrey's "coherence" axioms on decision theory imply P(E) = E(1 | F), and this equation is very useful, it does not <em>define</em> probability theory...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This looks like one of the cases where the definition that the argument claims to show is correct is less important than the definition the argument is using. But, as someone who was raised with Jeffrey, there's a certain emotional force to the belief that I should not believe people when they claim to show the way to subjective probability.</p><br><p>So here's an additional part of the puzzle here (that I don't have as a solution yet): if you're a philosopher who wants to say a certain kind of thing about the nature of belief, to defend yourself against a skeptic who says <em>you</em> believe in objective Bayes\xe2\x80\x94what should you say? It seems you can't just say: "well, this is not subjective Bayes." because the philosopher is also claiming that there's a sort of subjective Bayes, namely logical subjective probability. What can you say?</p><br><p>I think what the philosopher should say is: "well, my argument for this is of the form I want it to be, and therefore it's a coherent theory." Or, "I have observed something that should increase my credence in this being true" (where that observation is the argument itself).</p><br><p>And then they go out and claim to make this argument; and of course then the skeptic says: "so what?" and they say: "wait, can't you just be as skeptical of me saying I can observe a belief as well?" And they do in fact know how to be skeptical of someone having a belief, they've taught themselves. (I am a philosopher myself with no background in Bayes, in fact I have <em>never</em> had any background in Bayes. I claim in my blog posts and so on that I learned this from the philosophy professors at Oxford who taught me. Though I don't know if that's true; they may have been trying to make sure I didn't actually get this from somewhere.)</p><br><p>So, I find myself wondering if the following two statements are true:</p><br><ul>
<li>If you start with a very strong claim in favour of some argument, then you can refute it by showing it's coherent. But in order to refute it, you can't just show it's wrong, you have to also refute it by showing that it still forms a coherent theory after being weakened.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you have some evidence, but I <em>skeptically</em> claim that you do not know some evidence, because my skeptical claims are in fact consistent with your evidence, I must also be skeptical of your strong claim that you have this evidence.</li>
</ul><br><p>If this is the right way to interpret philosophical beliefs in general, the main reason why my intuitions haven't been more skeptical of a lot of other philosophical views, is because the philosophical methods are of a different kind. Some philosophers do not use scientific methods or scientific observations (for example, this is one of the common complaints about the philosophy of science); but some philosophers may be using methods that <em>seem</em> scientific, but to me feel wrong. In which case I should be skeptical of my own methods: the method that is generating the feelings of wrongness. I am pretty sure philosophy is not as good as science at this point.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
