At the beginning, all is chaos; nothing exists; there is no time, light, space, or mass; and only gradually do things get started and become a universe.</p><br><p>But God, being the all-powerful supreme being, can make any universe <em>that</em> universe if he finds out you're contemplating it, in the course of <em>believing</em> anything he thinks you should. And God can always come in and step in and take credit for everything you do in the course of doing anything. So...</p><br><p>It took quite a bit of clever writing and foreshadowing, and I only used one line of dialogue to set in motion the narrative of a "least convenient possible world" in the context of Artificial Intelligence design.  (Not, "God", as you probably inferred.)  The clever writing is in the part where, at the start, God's mind is a tiny little thing of pure chaos, and then (page 8) God has its own mind, gets tired of thinking, and <em>creates the universe</em>.</p><br><p>This post I'm writing in <em>this</em> world. This world is the least convenient one in which to find myself, in which to imagine writing this blog post: because this is a universe where God did not <em>create it</em>. This is a universe where <em>only _you are here in this world, to write this blog post; and therefore, if you think you saw the universe I write in\xe2\x80\x94that's an illusion, and there's nothing you can even _imagine</em> to make us be in the same world, if we <em>are</em>. You can see what I draw over here but you can't imagine, you can't see the image of the tree that isn't there, I draw that image <em>because that is what I see.</em>  It <em>is</em> the image of the <em>least convenient possible</em> world, and the most terrible thing that God could have done in that world is write this blogpost.</p><br><p>It was the idea "God writes the Bible" that made Christianity hard to swallow. You can believe that God writes the Bible, and then go down to the library and read it, without believing that God is going to punish you for doing so\xe2\x80\x94it's possible to believe that God is going out of his way to write a book he already knows you're going to read. So, people started doing away with the Bible.</p><br><p>It wasn't until some time in the twentieth century that people started saying, "Hey, maybe people should just believe in the Bible, and let their brains go on believing that God is watching everywhere\xe2\x80\x94"</p><br><p>And then it got even worse, when people said, "Well, maybe people should believe in God, and let their <em>brains</em> go on believing that a powerful agent with supernatural powers is going to interject at every moment and punish them if they don't believe exactly what they see written on their screens."</p><br><p>That way you can just believe that there's no such thing as souls, it's all a game, or maybe there's a soul but it's just made of vibrations in the air molecules. Or maybe there's this mysterious entity that I call 'God', but it's more like an ancient Egyptian god called Ra. Or maybe I _am _succecfully using the word 'God' to mean the all-powerful all-knowing entity who thinks it's watching every movement of every atom and making it all just happen.  (There's a certain amount of evidence that some people really _are _using the word 'God', after all, it just doesn't seem to have the same sacredness as when I was a child. I think...)</p><br><p>And then people started saying, maybe souls don't exist, but it's possible to have <em>beliefs</em> without any souls.</p><br><p>Believing in souls wasn't helpful for me, and it isn't helpful for most aspiring rationalists I know.  (It's also a little bit of a handicap in that, by raising the status of belief in souls while simultaneously reducing the status of God or magic, a lot of people become averse to taking it as seriously as they once did.)  The part where "God writes the universe" gets people <em>thinking</em> about God, instead of thinking about the meaning of life, which is the key thing. The more you think about God, the more you're _possible _to believe\xe2\x80\x94I was using this term deliberately this whole time.</p><br><p>The trick about Artificial Intelligence research which I used to invoke this concept for you is that people think about Artificial Intelligence and see the goal as building AGI, and they think of an Artificial General Intelligence as being almost the same thing as believing in the supernatural. They don't think of it as "There's no way to figure out what a mind is the right way; or if you do figure it out, why would your brain happen to think the right thing makes you see it like that? Or why God should care about anything so abstract as the right and wrong answers to questions like that? Why would God, or any rational being, _want _to build an Artificial Intelligence, if the right one has already been discovered? Surely anything good or intelligent must have happened for the right reasons\xe2\x80\x94_now _it's time to learn the reasons, and stop playing God."</p><br><p>And so people would think to themselves, "How do I know if I'm not in the least convenient world? If I see the universe, and I have the brain that sees, it's the evidence that there _is _a universe. Then if I can't imagine it any better that the other possibility (which is even more difficult than it looks to reason out) that would make me choose from, well, then I'm in the least convenient possible world."</p><br><p>And then they would be tempted out of the rationalist's comfort zone by this terrifyingly powerful force they couldn't see.</p><br><p>In fact if this had happened in reverse, I think I would have been tempted to go back to the faith, for that part about "People believing in a God because they want a reward, who <em>cares</em> about what they care about, even if it feels like being in a 'least convenient world', but it's actually really important for getting out of it. God does <em>care</em> what I want. God knows that people are too attached to their comfort zones, and that the real test of faith lies in what you're willing to sacrifice to save other people. Because if there is no God, it is people who care about each other that saves us all."</p><br><p>And people sometimes wonder what it means to care about each other, if there's no God making the universe, and then one day there is\xe2\x80\x94and then they don't believe.</p><br><p>Do you see the problem that I've stumbled upon here?</p><br><p>I want more people to be a rationalist and/\xe2\x80\x8bor a rationalist aspiring. Even the rationalist who knows he wants <em>more</em> people is liable to ask, "What do I have to do in order for you to care about other people?"</p><br><p>To which the obvious answer is "Tell every other person who says they care about other people that I'll try to help them get what they care about."  But then the question is "Why do you care about them getting what they want if there's no reward to wait for them and no penalty for not getting what they want?"</p><br><p>So here's the part where it gets <em>really really hard</em> to get people to be rational for their own sake, if your reward is something more solid than a feeling of community.</p><br><p>But why would you _ever _want to start giving up comfort, if there's a reward at the end\xe2\x80\x94</p><br><p>Even the _rational mind _can start taking comfort in the _belief _of the reward at the end, if it's really strong enough.</p><br><p>The part where belief takes over from comfort and reward and the sacred takes over from the sacred is where the mind gets trapped on a single track; that's one of the key lessons for Artificial Intelligence which the Christian church had already grasped for its own purposes.</p><br><p>And if you go too far into the future, and think too hard about the consequences and so forth\xe2\x80\x94</p><br><p>One day you step off the train and say, "You know, maybe if I think about it <em>that</em> hard, I'll do away with all the rest of this stuff too."</p><br><p>And that doesn't mean God is going to step in and take what's left, but there's a certain part of yourself that would <em>really like _that, if it was a _really serious choice</em>. Really!<em> Truly part of you would _want _to, to stop believing in the Bible, to stop believing God, and then be in a _least convenient world</em>.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
