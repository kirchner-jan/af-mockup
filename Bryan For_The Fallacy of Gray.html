<li>I want your attention...</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Originally published on <strong>Bryan's Blog</strong></p><br><p>The Challenge</p><br><p>You and a friend are sitting around reading about race. You start getting frustrated because the conversation keeps going in circles; she says white people are privileged, you reply that white people aren't privileged, they retort that black people also aren't privileged, you respond that black people aren't privileged either.</p><br><p>You start to get worried and decide to change the subject. "What's your favorite color?" you ask.</p><br><p>She doesn't say anything, so you keep pushing. "Why not?" you ask. "If it's so great, why ain't you rich?"</p><br><p>Finally, she answers. "I'm not so much into colors, myself. I like purple."</p><br><p>(the rest of this is a joke)</p><br><p>You are both aware of the fallacy, where someone comes away from a discussion dissatisfied from their side and convinced from the other persons side. There is a certain type of person that will get irrite by any kind of challenge to their narrative, and you're a bit worried you might have encountered this type of person while reading these posts. So here is an interesting little puzzle to solve:</p><br><p><strong>A Challenge!</strong></p><br><p><strong>I want your attention...</strong></p><br><p>The story ended with you both being persuaded by the arguments on the other side, but did that really happen at all? You are an impartial observer that can look at both sides without getting sucked in. It feels like you could just keep looking at both sides without giving up either. So let's look at the same situation in terms of colors. Someone on either side of the color line could be tempted to believe color is everything there is. However, if color were everything, then racism would be a big deal in our society. It's not\xe2\x80\x94in fact, our society is highly diverse, and there is no need to use the color line to explain this at all. Let's make another scenario that seems more familiar, and see how easy it is for us as neutral observers to see both sides.</p><br><p><strong>A Problem!</strong></p><br><p>An economist and a lawyer are both thinking about how much they should pay to fly on the next flight. They have the same information and have the same decision process for choosing the appropriate price. So what's the difference between the two of them? Who is the correct decision maker?</p><br><p>The lawyer answers "I'm the Decision Maker. I'm the one that has to pay."</p><br><p>The economist answers "But you are the Decision Maker. You're the one that has the Job to decide which decision maker to use."  The two of them would probably get along just fine as friends and economic advisors, but as long as they don't live together it will be difficult for an outside third party to distinguish which side is right. Maybe if you get into some very intense debates with them, that can prove to be an interesting exercise?</p><br><p>I think your response to the color examples will be something like: "Well, I could look at the fact that purple is not particularly privileged without really considering the context?"</p><br><p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p><br><p><strong>"Well, I could" (or I)____ "look at the fact that in this situation, the lawyer is the correct DM" without really considering the other context?" (or I)</strong></p><br><p><strong>[For the rest of this challenge you should respond to a "look at (or I)" challenge. For the challenge to be valid it should be a true "look at" challenge that would prove difficult to ignore even with your usual epistemic caution! Don't bother looking at me if you can't take into consideration all the other possible context!]____ ____[There is also a version in the comments section, so please be a bit more generous than usual to people who can't look into their own minds\xe2\x80\x94this is a bit of a skill to know how to do the right thing in a "Look at my map or you're wrong" challenge.]____ (or I) </strong>  [Or "What should I do in the situation that I'm facing" or your version of a "look at me" challenge!]</p><br><p><strong>A Context!</strong></p><br><p>The lawyer had a job; she actually had to make a decision to decide whether the economist should be the DM. The economist had a skill that gave him the potential to be the DM, but he didn't have any particular right to that position, and so he wasn't the DM. The lawyer could be the DM because she was the person that decided who gets to be the DM. I wouldn't be surprised to find that people are biased in favor of their decision making ability, when presented with information like "You could actually be the decision maker", but it's not completely unfair to look at the real world consequences of having a given skill as an example of an actual relevant skill.</p><br><p>I won't say "no one has an inalienable right to live off the fruits of others labors", because I don't believe in this sort of thing but I do believe in having legitimate skills that can be exploited, so long as these skills are not being exploited to cause harm. So I will say things like "If you think your color should dictate the DM, you should have been a lawyer if you were smart enough and/\xe2\x80\x8bor rich enough to make the lawyer's job easier."</p><br><p><strong>The Fallacy!</strong></p><br><p>I think this example will work at least as well with the classic "If you aren't for gay rights, you must not be for animal rights."  The lawyer actually has (or I'd argue has) the skills to make the lawyering job easier. If the lawyer has (or I) the skills to be a good DM, then she probably actually should be the DM or at least be the person that makes the decision for who gets to be a DM.</p><br><p>This can be further illustrated with "I can be the DM for this matter if I wanted to be".  Or "I have the skills to be in this position if I want it" or "I have the color of skin to be a lawyer, but I don't want to be one because I want it in ways other than making other people pay for my services".  If this weren't the case, then it wouldn't be possible for the lawyer to actually decide who gets to be DM, and someone else would have to make that decision for someone else, whether it be another person, a machine, or some alien being.</p><br><p><strong>The Argument</strong></p><br><p>There's a difference between:</p><br><p>(1) "I'm good at making good decisions for me"</p><br><p>(2) There are very good people that are the best at making good decisions to make themselves useful" </p><br><p>And "You should pick yourself as DM"</p><br><p>(3) "You should pick me as DM"</p><br><br><p><strong>In reality the lawyer and economist are not going to be the DM because they weren't skilled enough, so we don't need (3).  I'll just explain (1) as it is in the above example anyway, and will leave out (2).</strong></p><br><p>"You should pick (2) as DM"</p><br><p>I could just as likely ask for a "If you want to be a lawyer then there are lots of reasons you should be a lawyer"</p><br><p>"Are there? Well look at the number of people that are talented at (2) and who have trouble making a living. Even among lawyers those who make lots of money aren't especially skilled at (2)."</p><br><p>Asking "Would you trust me if I said (2)?" makes a lot of assumptions about what skills or qualities will be important to (2).  It's a difficult argument, but it's not necessarily wrong if the assumption is "I'm talented at (2)."  "You should pick myself" is a non-sequitur, regardless of any sort of skill, so "You should pick who is best" is too. The "look at the data of the best at (2)" argument is the same as the "take my word for it" argument. There's nothing special about "look at the best", and in this case it's not necessarily accurate either.</p><br><p>In my opinion, the lawyer was making (1), and the economist was making (2).</p><br><p><strong>The Answer</strong></p><br><p>Look at your own situation when you are trying to select a DM. I think this will take us a long way towards the sort of answer you want in the color example. It will take us to, "You have (or I) a skill that I think should make you a decision maker, but you're not" or even "I think you should have that skill, but I'm not."  It might even help you identify some other important skills in your decision making process.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
