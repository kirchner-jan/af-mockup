</ul><br><p>(This post has been written with a view towards possible employment in a computational chemistry lab.)  </p><br><ol>
<li>Theoretical background.</li>
</ol><br><p>A number of years before I started working in a computational chemistry research lab and thinking about problems of interest to me, I have studied various math courses at various universities, and I thought a lot about which kinds of math would be most useful for me to learn and in which domains. </p><br><p>For someone who is interested primarily in computational chemistry \xe2\x80\x94 and who wants to be able to, in principle, solve problems of interest to the chemist community in computational chemistry \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to someone who has some sort of broader interest in the mathematical aspect of problems in various areas of science, I believe that some math is important. I'm thinking specifically in this context of a certain subset of math that has to do with model building, model usage, and numerical calculations, with a view towards their potential application to the computational chemistry community.</p><br><p>If your initial question about computer programs is about how to make a program or a program to build a computer program that does X, then as long as you don't have any experience with programs, and as long as the problem space concerned and your current mental model of it is reasonably compact, the math taught in a mathematics or computer science degree can probably be helpful for you directly. </p><br><p>However, if you want to make an accurate mathematical prediction of how things <em>outside</em> the program domain will work, or if you want to be able to <em>generate a program</em> to solve problems of interest, or even if you want to <em>be able to understand a program written by others</em> \xe2\x80\x94 in this case you should have some theoretical understanding of the subject: you should understand how a program works. A computer science degree <em>may</em> improve your ability to write your own programs if you have that prior background, but it does not <em>automatically</em> give you that background.</p><br><p>1.1 A model of the <em>subject</em> of mathematics.</p><br><p>In other words, a subject whose mathematical aspects I would want to study at a college are (a) mathematics as taught at a college or university, together with (b) math taught in another field such as physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, engineering or physics. I will call this broad subject of math (including this narrower topic of computational chemistry)  a "subject" of mathematics; I have no reason to think it has any sort of mathematical character distinct from the usual broad subjects of these fields: mathematics being relevant to so many fields (the number of mathematics textbooks written to be of interest to a wide audience \xe2\x80\x94 such as in the introductory level of a university course \xe2\x80\x94 contains hundreds of pages of technical proofs and examples of calculations in other fields). A typical undergraduate course \xe2\x80\x94 e.g. in electrical engineering \xe2\x80\x94 is a relatively small part of the math subject matter. I'm interested to know which aspects and fields of mathematics students study, but I do not know how many years they tend to spend studying mathematics in comparison with any one of the above fields.</p><br><p>Computational chemistry falls under the discipline of <em>informatics</em> or <em>computer science</em>; it's in the subheading to the left. Although many of the basic ideas of informatics and computer science are useful concepts, these fields do not overlap much with mathematics: computer scientist write computer programs for <em>other</em> people to run on <em>other</em> computers; mathematicians are generally interested in the use of one's computer to build a computer, but they write their own computer programs. </p><br><p>So computer science and mathematics might seem to overlap with little practical difference. </p><br><p>But there is a difference. For example, consider these subjects:</p><br><ul>
<li>Mathematical logic. I am thinking particularly of the theory of "mathematical deduction": an argument that has a number of premises ("observations") and a conclusion drawn from them; sometimes, a number of such arguments, in which the conclusions are more general. Formal proofs are an example. (An example of a non-formal, useful argument could be given in the text of a blog post \xe2\x80\x94 I can think of at least one example. However, I don't know enough "non-formal" material to write this blog post.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Analysis, especially of functions, especially in one or more of <em>finiteness</em>, convergence, integrability, etc.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The study of differential equations of physics, biology, economics, etc.; this is an important subfield of mathematics (especially of mathematics in physics), but I am not specifically thinking of computer science or of the narrower field of computational chemistry. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Probability theory (more specifically, its branches such as Bayesian probability theory).</li>
</ul><br><p>These belong to fields that are very different from each other: mathematical logic has, as its primary aim, to prove things <em>false</em>; analysis is largely interested in the extent to which claims made in arguments are <em>true</em>, or alternatively, have "a lot of truth about it". Probability theory and Bayesian inference is even more different from the other three.  </p><br><p>There is a continuum between these three: for example, it's possible to prove statements with mathematical logic, or in analysis, without using probability theory. It's also possible to think probabilistically in an analysis, or probabilistically in mathematics.</p><br><p>I have given three examples here that I think are somewhat illustrative, but in reality mathematical analysis would be in a much broader and more varied set of fields; there's a substantial overlap.</p><br><p>What else is in the subject of mathematics? There's the study of integers, decimals, fractional numbers of various types, and so on; but I have not been able to figure out much about this for each of the branches of math I've studied. To my current understanding it has very little theoretical underpinning and is primarily built on in practice and experimentation. Perhaps if I spend a lot more time in this field I'm likely to learn more...</p><br><p>The domain of problems of interest to other disciplines seems even broader: in my undergraduate studies \xe2\x80\x94 I started in biology and then in physics \xe2\x80\x94 I had to study lots of chemistry and physics, as well as biology and many other subjects. </p><br><p>I now know that the mathematical modeling that I would want to learn and be able to apply is something to do with:</p><br><ul>
<li>Modeling the interaction between small particles that move around on cell surfaces and cells. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Modeling how some particular chemical system reacts with a substance of interest, e.g. a drug molecule. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Combining these kinds of mathematical models with information from experiments and simulations of the physical world to predict possible outcomes (e.g. the effect of a drug molecule on some cell type and organism type). </li>
</ul><br><p>However, these problems are not "mathematical" in the sense that there's an abstract mathematical structure underlying what I want to do. It seems to me that the relevant abstract mathematics I would have a comparative advantage in learning \xe2\x80\x94 e.g., computer science, statistics, game theory, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 are the parts of computer science that are of use in other subjects that in turn are used in computational chemistry. They include, for example, algorithms that are used in simulation of the world; algorithms for representing graphs, sequences, strings, etc.; algorithms for representing physical processes like diffusion, chemical reactions, etc.; algorithms that can be combined to model the various parts of a complex physical process.</p><br><ol>
<li>Ability to create models  and models of models</li>
</ol><br><p>Computational science deals with modeling: building a model of a physical system or of a process, in terms of its different parts, using mathematics and other tools; a model that one then runs and gets an answer out of. </p><br><p>I think this sort of mathematical modeling is not that different from what statisticians do for some applications of the Bayesian inference framework, or computer programmers doing data analysis or machine learning, although the former two fields can have aspects of interest in computational chemistry, and the latter two fields will sometimes be involved in computational chemistry. </p><br><p>For example, suppose I do some experiments in physics: my system is a small particle on an ice cube; the system I want to model is the interaction between this particle and the liquid from which ice is made, and ultimately the interaction between that liquid and my environment. The results I get when I run my model are likely to end up being complicated mathematical objects (potentially, with different components; see the first picture here).</p><br><p>This is not the same as modeling of real processes in the world, which does not deal with mathematical objects.</p><br><ol>
<li>The ability to use models to  predict the effect of different factors in a field  under consideration</li>
</ol><br><p>For example, say I have a chemical system that I want to model using some computer program, but that has to be run on a computer. At some time in the process, I need to know the concentrations of each component of the system.</p><br><p>The program needs to include a representation for each component in its simulation of the chemical system, including the fact that the concentration of a given component will be affected by other molecules in the system.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
