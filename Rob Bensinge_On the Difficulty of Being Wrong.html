If, after completing an introductory course in the history of philosophy, you thought the "hardest" philosophical problem was "Is there such a thing as a true map of America?" then you may want to be cautious applying these same skills to something like "Are there objectively correct moral theories?" or "Are there objectively right or wrong theories of God?" I don't have any particular reason to privilege or downplay these as the "hard problems" around which the history of philosophy is centered, so I won't be too picky about them.</em></p><br><p>The main thing I take away from introductory courses in the history of Philosophy is, always, "If you want to win debates in philosophy, debate hard stuff." If you just want to do philosophy right up until the time when you publish a paper in a journal, you don't have to worry about debate-winning; you can take the easy way out and use ordinary Philosophy 101: think through the problem on a conscious level, and hope your conscious reasoning is right and everyone else in the field is mistaken.</p><br><p>Sometimes, if you're good at arguing and you can think hard, you can avoid debate-winning and still find a way to get the right answer in the end. But usually, you're not good at arguing, and you can't think hard. That's fine too, as long as you're able to take the right answer on a conscious level. But if you can <em>only</em> take the right answer, you're basically guaranteed to lose one of your attempts at debating philosophy.</p><br><p>A second thing I take away is, sometimes there's a really good and legitimate justification for someone, even on the very first pass, to expect to have a really hard time finding the flaw in someone else's argument.</p><br><p>Someone I respect once wrote a comment explaining why his criticisms of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics sound reasonable:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>In general, __I feel like a great deal of the issues in philosophy of science /\xe2\x80\x8b physics /\xe2\x80\x8b physics of mind, etc. have to do with being able to come to philosophical solutions in a way that doesn't require making a ton of new empirical observations first, i.e. via abstract, purely conceptual reasoning. __From one point of view, this is a challenge, and for people who can't do the required abstract reasoning well, it's really hard to evaluate other people's arguments in philosophy unless you spend <em>a lot</em> of time getting to know them.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>To me, this comment seems accurate enough as a description of what I <em>do</em> find hard to do, that I found its reasoning more convincing than the one I immediately rejected, without trying for long and hard to get a handle on it, and without making sure that I understood what was going on well enough to be able to evaluate the underlying reasoning.</p><br><p>Philosophical thinking is really hard for <em>me</em>, at least.</p><br><p>In all honesty, one of the reasons this whole situation looks like a great deal for me <em>does</em> come from the fact that I'm not very good at philosophy: I've spent years training on a variety of cognitive biases, and I've developed a fairly high level of abstraction, so I can't very well argue that what I don't understand is unimportant.</p><br><p>From the outside view, it looks obvious that debates in philosophy of science could be hard to settle. I feel the same way about debates in other epistemological fields: like debates in philosophy of cognitive science, debates in the philosophy of religion, disputes in the metaphysics of ethics and so on. And yet, I don't <em>feel</em> this that way.</p><br><p>It seems to me that many people can't, for some reason, think at the high levels of abstraction which are required to solve these problems. It may be a result of general cognitive dysfunctions, or a specific result of socialization (or a combo). Most philosophers I know can think at these levels, but they probably all <em>also</em> think at the level of "if all the evidence indicates that a proposition is false, then it's a bad idea to endorse it", which is more abstract than most people's innate epistemic wiring for good reasons, and this gives them an advantage.</p><br><p>But if you don't know the high abstract reasoning skills that will give you the edge, it's easy to see that philosophy of science could look hard, and <em>not</em> at all like every other field. In the case of philosophy of religion, for example, I don't find debates in the field especially hard; I've spent maybe half an hour thinking through the arguments. The only way I can see why philosophers of religion would differ is if they <em>hadn't</em> developed the ability to think at a sufficiently abstract level for the problem in question.</p><br><p>So we have a two-factor hypothesis: the problems of philosophy look hard sometimes even for people with abstract reasoning skills; and some philosophical fields look hard even when the people involved aren't very good at abstract reasoning. Which helps explain the differences between my views, and those of the philosopher in my earlier comment.</p><br><p>We don't have good access to people's native abstract reasoning abilities, so we can only guess by comparing them to the abstraction levels needed to solve certain problems\xe2\x80\x94and comparing the problem to the cognitive processes used by other fields. From the point of view of debates in the actual practice of philosophy, it's not too surprising that those debates tend to center around difficult abstract problems, or philosophical fields may tend to be difficult to resolve from that point of view.</p><br><p>But from the outside view, there's no obvious reason philosophy should be difficult.</p><br><p>As far as I can tell, this is mainly one of those situations where the best answer is not to give up entirely on finding a solution; it's just to be aware of the trade-offs involved, and to proceed accordingly.</p><br><p>(I'll be writing up short replies to the comment and to the post as I come across new things to add to it; I'm not done yet, and there's still a lot more I want to say.)</p><br><p>ADDED:</p><br><p>Some things I've read in the comments make me wonder whether the people who are most likely to believe this are the people who are the least likely to think very seriously when arguing for one of these positions.</p><br><p>It's possible that I'm overestimating the difficulty of understanding what's going on without empirical evidence, because it took me so long to understand and argue, and to think about the possible consequences, that other people who seem more likely to be naturally more abstract thinkers had already thought of it before. But I still believe there's a lot of truth in the original idea.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
