<li>I.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>I.</strong></p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate my current philosophical maturity at about 3.3, but I'd guess that it's likely to go higher. I've been doing intellectual projects since I was a toddler (writing an entire book in my head while taking a single shower), but never in my life have I felt as compelled to <em>think and do philosophical work</em> as I do right now; and this seems to be <em>related</em> (if you know of any) to my age 22 \xe2\x86\x92 23.3 \xe2\x86\x92 24 years being the latest step in my life trajectory.</p><br><p>Let me explain why. From the perspective of my previous philosophical projects, I look back and I can see the exact steps I took in thinking my way from one state of confusions to another. Here is my summary:</p><br><ul>
<li>In eighth grade, I started reading this book called Philosophy, <em>The Great Mambo Chicken</em> (a mix of Hegel, Kant, Wittgenstein, and Fyodorovitch Chekhov). It was published in 1985, and taught philosophy in ninth grade. I'd say that its title was fairly good and its content was pretty moderate. A kid these days might have been more interested in <em>Thinking Physics</em>, the latest book on the subject and apparently by one of my favorite historical mathematicians. Alas, by the time I was in high school, I started reading science fiction instead. Since then, my love for philosophy has remained but a hobby.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I've been reading Less Wrong and other LW-esque blogs, reading LW-related literature, and participating in the relevant conversations and debates. I've made friends in the LW community, and learned more and more about this field, until the point that I can fairly speak of myself as "not an existential or even post-utopian anymore."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>By the way, my posts on atheism have been a part of the LW community since 2012 at the latest, but I don't feel like I should put credit where credit is due: the community has influenced me for better and for worse.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>Philosophical Investigations</em> is an obscure book in history of philosophy. My only prior exposure to it is through this link (which I find more illustrative, and possibly more accessible). I was surprised to read about 20 years of progress in philosophical research by David Hume, the author (or editor, in the case of <em>Investigations</em>). It gave me a whole new perspective on philosophy, and a feeling of <em>rightness</em> about progress in philosophy.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My first exposure to a philosopher of language through LW. (His name is Bartlett Spencer. I haven't found a direct link between this website and The Language Instinct (now on my reading stack at college). So I'm giving my theory of mind credit, even though I'm not sure of it).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I was impressed by the level of engagement within the LW community; it gives me a whole new respect for intellectual progress. From my perspective, the LW community is way above my level. I like that it's made of people with <em>really advanced</em> minds, and that it's <em>really well thought-out</em>.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'm impressed by the quality of the arguments in the rationalistsphere, for instance Paul Christiano's work on iterated amplification and Eliezer Yudkowsky's recent thoughts on non-mysterious religion. But I have a hard time understanding and internalizing some of the more complicated LW ideas, which are presented as a sort of tl;dr.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I started reading a whole bunch of philosophical literature by the time I started med school. This happened because I noticed a philosophical bias in myself. I realized that I thought that I knew what philosophy was supposed to be about, yet every time I read about, say, a Kantian imperative, I quickly jumped to utilitarianism (or the real world) and had no illusions about the latter. When I started med school, I was a teenager. My med students seemed to be adult human beings who could reason for themselves, so it was pretty understandable to me how they managed to avoid a philosophical bias. I found it kind of amusing that the adult "wizards of the word" I was criticizing were myself and all my med classmates around the same age.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My experience has shaped a feeling of <em>authoritativeness</em> in me toward rationalistsphere philosophy, for two big reasons: I <em>agree</em> with what Yudkowsky wrote, and I have no reservations about accepting a label like "scientist" for myself.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'm not sure why, I can feel the power of this community in my bones. It's just a feeling. When I read David Chalmers' book <em>The Conscious Mind</em>, I felt that something clicked inside me. It felt that Eliezer Yuddkowsky's writing about the Singularity and Friendly AI gave him a huge amount of credibility, and I started to hope that I would be able to write, speak, and even teach for the betterment of this community.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In 2014, I started blogging about my feelings about rationalism and my lack thereof. I started getting reactions, and sometimes commenters asked me to explain, to which I would reply that "it's in my head" as an explanation. So I started spending more time thinking about these ideas that so <em>totally belong to</em> the rationalistspheres. I also tried to spend more time writing on these topics because "It's in my head." (Although at least for me, those two things are almost always true). In 2014, the LW hivemind began influencing my writing style to the point where I realized that I was <em>trying</em> to write about the rationalistspheric ideas which were so interesting. I decided to write a few posts explaining <em>why</em> I couldn't be a rationalist anymore. My thinking got more sophisticated, and I had the feeling that I was learning much more than I was giving to anyone else.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I was excited by this "new" approach, I felt like I had a better understanding of my own thinking, and a better sense of what philosophy was actually about. I started writing about these ideas, and I realized that I could actually write something which would be a popular book on the subject. At that point, my inner voice decided to start putting all of this down inside a blog, rather than keeping it within my own head, in order to give myself a larger audience. I stopped blogging and continued reading LessWrong.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Before graduating I had already started making arguments that "rationalish" philosophy should focus less on "big words" and philosophy should <em>succeed</em>. There were several big problems with "rationalish" philosophical theories, particularly the problem of logical uncertainty and the problem of induction. The big argument against these ideas was that in the real world you don't have a "rational" reason to think that the next bit of evidence will be <em>logically</em> true. Even though science and logic are often treated by rationalists as the pinnacle of knowledge, when it comes to trying to understand the world, the best advice they can give you is "use empirical evidence, and if empirical evidence fails, then ask your friends why they think science has produced good results in the past."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>So at this point, the rationalistspheres and the LessWrong-es have become two <em>different</em> communities in my head. I've read the sequences and I still participate sometimes, but the posts and the comments I've learned from are now in different places of my brain.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>On January 1st, I started thinking that, since <em>this</em> is how I've thought my way from old philosophical confusions unto the new one, maybe what philosophers could learn from LessWrong-esque blogs is not "how to do philosophy," but "how to think better about philosophy." By this point it'd been several months since my initial blog post about why I no longer take Kant's imperative seriously. But I was still having trouble grokking the content of Yudkowsky's writing about Friendly AI, and I wondered if the solution to this problem didn't lie in the new philosophical work by some of my fellow LessWrong-ers, that is, by the rationalistsphemers.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>When I went to med school, I already read a lot of contemporary analytic philosophy literature, but I didn't come across any rationalist literature before. I decided to finally read and engage with the rationalistspherics because I felt that in order to think about my current philosophical difficulties, I needed some sort of background against which I could start. Also, reading the sequences had been the first step in my engagement with the "rationalistsphere" and I wanted to see if I could make some progress here. I started by reading a bunch of posts on my favorite blog, Lukeprog's.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This blog seems to have a huge impact on LessWrong-ians, and I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not. In any case I didn't have any trouble reading it, and I read through the posts. Lukeprog is one of the main authors who taught me about the rationalistspyre, and his posts are the ones I followed into their own writings, reading a few at a time and trying to see the structure in what they wrote.</li>
