Why the hell aren't we doing the whole "artificial intelligence" thing full throttle?</p><br><p>Let's suppose, by way of illustration, that there were 10 humans and 10 chimpanzees, all of whom were trained to solve chess problems. And by "solve them" we mean build a full tree of moves and countermoves from a position. So one human and one chimpanzee might work out a couple of moves in advance before the opponents (the "humans") could. It might be more efficient to just let each human do one full pass through the tree, and pick the move with the earliest history of countermoves.</p><br><p>But the chimps will never get good at chess. The same goes for the two human players trying to figure out how to build a tree of moves and moves. They might "solve" some problems in limited ways.  (Note that the chimps and humans don't think, or act, or solve problems at all. They have no awareness of the state of the world, the future, their own actions or those of others, or anything like that. They may be taught chess and given a hand of cards that say when they can and cannot open themâ€”but they don't <em>think</em>; they don't even think that they have a plan or a thought. They just do what they're told.)</p><br><p>(And if you're wondering why I've labeled the "humans" as "artificial intelligence", the answer is that they do not play chess, and the chess-playing machinery was implemented independently by two companies. For similar reasons, the human "AIs" may also have been independently developed by two separate companies and have absolutely no clue what either one is doing.)</p><br><p>So let's run with this. Assume the chimps and the humans are not the right size. We might imagine that the chimps, say, all weigh around one hundred pounds, and the AIs in a two-person team are all three teraFLOPS (trillion floating point operations per second).1  The chimps and AIs may or may not be of different species, as far as the chess example is concerned; you might suppose that the chimps are bonobos, or some species of hominids, and the Ais are humans engineered by a secret company. But in the end, it doesn't matter. You could have chimps and Ais of any species at all (or maybe of the same species), but even if human is much more clever than the chimps, it would still take them the same number of steps to get to the same result.</p><br><p>We know we need more than two AIs to get better results. We could have three, but that makes it even worse. If they're even more intelligent than the original two, it may be that they have to "wake up" a single one to have a conversation.</p><br><p>(Which brings us to another puzzle. If we have three of them, but they all have to "wake each other up", isn't that just a bit inefficient? And if they're all just in the same room, talking about chess, what's taking so long? In fact, can we really build more than two of these? I've been asked this a couple of times. (It turns out that when I think of AI this far out, I realize I've no earthly idea what it takes to build an AI. I have to stop and ask what it means if a thing is more intelligent than me, or, what it means if I can't build an AI because I've never seen an AI. There are a lot of problems here that are very hard, and I need to sort them out because I really want to get something like an "artificial intelligence".)  So here's my guess.</p><br><p>Suppose that it takes the first pair less than ten minutes to solve the chess problem by playing through the full tree all at once. The second pair would still need to spend around ten minutes "waking up" the first. The third pair would need to spend around thirty minutes thinking about the first pair, plus ten minutes of "wiring up" to their own intelligence and chess problem-solving mechanism...and then another ten minutes for them to "wake up.")</p><br><p>So...four "AIs", I think, are optimal. Four AIs can think about three other AIs who think about two other AIs who thought about one other AI.</p><br><p>How much do four AIs cost? This is a hard question. Suppose that the first pair's clock costs $10 at their current level of skill. That would cost one human $10. And suppose they each have the ability to create one more pair of AIs at their current level, but can only use two of them on the chess problem at a time; then each additional pair would only cost the one person $5. So four AIs cost as much as $2. You could, as I mentioned, have five AIs and charge $2 per pair. I think that's probably about right. (But it may be lower.)</p><br><p>As a last note, I have, in the previous paragraphs, assumed that all the Ais are playing chess, instead of solving general problem-solving problems. General problem-solving is, in some sense, easier. It's just as difficult to be intelligent in general case, but also more difficult to be intelligent than anyone else. For example, one AI might be the very first AI, and another might just be the second AI, and yet the first AI might see better which pieces the game can and cannot see. The first AI might be able to "wake up the second" without spending any time on its own intelligence.</p><br><p>(And there's a lot we don't know about building a general intelligence. It may be that it doesn't need much "waking up". It could be that what we're doing with all these specialized Ais is simply wrong, and any Ai could do all that without ever "waking up to its own intelligence".)</p><br><p>The same applies to an AI and a chimp. The chimps won't get better at chess. But if you gave the humans better tools to think more deeply, you could probably build more efficient versions of them; and if you gave them better tools to think about the tool builders, you could probably get a "human with AI assistant" to have a better grasp.</p><br><p>II</p><br><p>So, a while back I had a really fascinating idea. It's a bit fuzzy in my recollection, but what I remember is that: "What if AIs were created not by one company, and not by a top chess player either, but by a team assembled for a particular problem, the sort of problem that lots of people have wondered at, and that a lot of people are trying to come at from a number of different angles?"</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
