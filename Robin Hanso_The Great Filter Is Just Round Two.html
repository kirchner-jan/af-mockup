The story follows a group of Eloi exploring a vast empty planet, and encountering an interesting obstacle.</p><br><p>The story starts with "The Age of the Eloi".  I'll try to summarize the most important elements of the story, and then go on to explain why I've come to think that those two key ideas might be confused.</p><br><p>The Age of the Morlocks</p><br><p>For our purposes here, the key facts are:</p><br><ul>
<li>The Eloi evolved from an ancient civilization called Ur, which had a technologically mature culture of some centuries before their decline in population and technological advance.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>As the story goes on, more and more of Ur's descendants have lived to reach our present age of technological maturity.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Eventually, the world is running out of resources, and all available planets are the same. The civilizations cannot communicate with each other, and with any more advanced species.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Since population never increases, the average level of technology never increases through the history of the universe.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>To the Eloi, this is paradise, a peaceful world of plenty, filled with fascinating machines and technology. But to the Morlocks, it's a living hell!</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Morlocks' civilization is very young, and they are at war with a competing group of Eloi called the Laps.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Laps' civilization is also very young, and has only recently developed the technology for space travel.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Meanwhile, in the distant past, the Malthusian trap\xe2\x80\x94the fact that most new generations end up worse off\xe2\x80\x94reaches past the point where all available planets contain life, to a final point where all new species fail to develop technology beyond their planet.</li>
</ul><br><p>Before we get to the details, here are some more general points for why this is an interesting story to be thinking about:</p><br><ul>
<li>What if we're living at the very end of our technological civilization and history? What if human technology is ending soon and we have no realistic hope of surviving?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are there large alien civilizations out there already?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How likely is it that we're living and succeeding because our technology has only just begun to run out?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If humanity is near the last of its line of technological civilizations, what will have happened along the way? What can we learn about the future, from our place at the end of history?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If everything has indeed ended already, where on Earth can a dying species go? If it's impossible to survive on Earth, where else?</li>
</ul><br><p>From the Eloi's perspective, the future looks good, or even better than the past.  "We did what we could. We got as far as we could, given the laws and physics that came to be. That's why we're all still around. The problem is our lack of resources and space."</p><br><p>From the Morlocks' perspective, history is an awful period that should have never happened.  "We're still here because we didn't care enough about dying in the desert to avoid it. Only two of us, out of billions of our kind, made it this far. We should've known, if we'd cared, there was going to come a point when technology died, and no one would leave us. Our survival is only a brief reprieve from extinction."</p><br><p>From the Elo's perspective, the Morlocks aren't even wrong to be bitter.  "Do you have any idea what it's like to be the last of a dying race? To be facing the prospect of extinction?"</p><br><p>The Eloi think they're dealing with a civilization of their level of technology, which is clearly too low to last very long.  "We understand, and we sympathize with, your plight. But we have no reason or responsibility to keep ourselves from making things even better for you. You've got to be out there somewhere by now:  you don't need to survive the same fate as we do."</p><br><p>The Morlocks see the Eloi as a selfish, alien species.  "If we could only reach them, we could show them the error of their ways, and we could make them give us enough of what we need to survive."</p><br><p>The Eloi see the Morlocks as savages who could perhaps be kept in check through violence, if it made any difference to them at all.  "We'd love to try to help\xe2\x80\x94but as much as we'd like that to be true, we wouldn't want anyone who got involved to be hurt. It would be a waste of time. The future is going to go its own way, and no one can make it otherwise."</p><br><p>We are going to get a chance to meet the Eloi and the Morlocks, and see why people disagree about what they need.</p><br><ul>
<li>The Morlock and Eloi civilizations had a technological and technological gap, so no matter what the Morlocks or the Eloi could do, the other side would be superior.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This meant that the Eloi civilization could never be completely conquered by the Morlocks, even if the latter had enough force\xe2\x80\x94in the same way that we might conquer another distant alien species if they were technologically advanced enough to challenge us.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>But, this meant that, although the Eloi civilization was doomed, they could still be left alone in peace.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Elo and Morlock civilizations had a technological gap, so that there would always be room for them to improve, and they never went out-of-date with each other.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They never had time to do so anyways, as they always knew their limits and knew to stick to them. They never took on more than they could handle.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>No one in either world was a desperate savage or an incompetent savage, and no one was even a bit desperate or a bit incompetent.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They just knew that their survival was not going to depend on their own technology or ability to invent inventions, but they would die if they tried to survive by getting what they needed from other alien civilizations. No one ever tried to help, be it the Eloi or the Morlocks; nor did anyone ever need to be given resources, nor was anyone ever offered them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This situation persisted until the day of The Great Filter.</li>
</ul><br><p>The Great Filter</p><br><p>The name of the story is about two alien species who explore a massive uninhabited galaxy, and one of these two species runs out of something so fundamental that it's a major blow to their technological ability.</p><br><p>The Eloi and the Malthusians make several arguments which have been discussed before. I'm going to mention another one which is less often emphasized.</p><br><ul>
<li>The most fundamental problem is that for some species, the size of the filter depends not just on the total number of other, equally-developed, species in the galaxy, but also on how many are already <em>developing</em>, and the number who are in a later technology stage than that of the filter. In particular, it depends on the _rate of technological development. _The farther back in the filter progress the species is, the smaller the filter, even if most of the species still exist.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>For most species which cannot survive the filter, the number which come to exist in our timeline will be very small, possibly as small as one in a million; so their experience of dying in the filter is very little different than their experience of dying of starvation in the middle of a famine or disease.</li>
</ul><br><p>I think this is an important argument, and I think most of the people who have thought about it seem to agree; and yet, I've never seen anyone put this conclusion in terms of the Great Filter's dependence of the number of technologically mature civilizations per volume of galaxy, as I've done here. It's hard for me to put all the details into the context of the Great Filter, but I think the Eloi's (and probably the Malthus' as well?) perspective makes the most plausible sense of what the Morlock's are talking about.</p><br><p>Why are so many other, older, technologically-advanced, species doomed?</p><br><ul>
<li>Because technological development is so slow and infrequent, they can't pass through the filter as quickly as younger filters can.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because technological advancement is so costly, they're unable to produce much of a surplus from their investments.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because their technology is too weak to support many other life-forms, most technologies they try to construct become unnecessary for surviving in the desert, or in the wilderness.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because the population in an area will quickly grow too large for a technology to support, as soon as the technology can maintain its population.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because there's no reason that any single technology or any technology sector, any more than science or mathematics, ought to be expected to advance faster overall than other sectors due to its centralization, as an isolated case might.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because every technology that can make a species self-sufficient in material, requires some sort of knowledge, and the knowledge required is not easily copied.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because a species can only evolve more complex technology if it already has complex technology. This makes it a more difficult, not a much easier, problem to solve than the problem of producing complex technology before you have it.  </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Because, in order to make complex technology, you first need complex adaptation-execution machinery. The most powerful, most numerous, most stable species will have evolved such machinery long before this species gets around to it.</li>
</ul><br><p>On the Eloi's view, the Morlocks are being a bit too self-centered and self-destructive.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
