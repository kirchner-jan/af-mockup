However, the world is already headed in the wrong direction (global average temperature has increased by <strong>5.8</strong>\xc2\xb0C so far). This makes it hard to assess how much things have gotten worse, or to estimate the best time to do something. How much of <em>this</em> comes from CO2 concentration and how much from other nonanthropogenic drivers of temperature change, like solar radiation management? Is it too late to change course? Can we somehow keep up emissions at the same rate and still stay within temperature limits?</p><br><p>For some, the fact that the problem exists at all is itself important information:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>We have <em>sensible rules</em> on things like what to do with pollutants, so it's good news that there are rules against things like carbon dioxide.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This is a framing that makes it sound easy to implement and could be politically viable:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>If people started being more conscientious about how much carbon dioxide they released into the atmosphere, maybe we could just <em>set an upper bound</em> and <em>not let it get near there</em> and that might be good enough.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>But there were already some attempts in the climate policy world to set such a limit, and they were often met with skepticism for technical reasons, or at least not taken quite seriously.  (See here, here, here, and here.)  However, at the same time, it seems that there might be a way to reach temperature limits and actually cause the temperature to fall more slowly, by deliberately increasing the amount of carbon absorbed by the oceans. The two basic ideas of such approaches are sequestration and carbon capture. Both work by removing carbon from the atmosphere. However, sequestration is less scalable than carbon capture, which is also limited by the need to burn fossil fuels, and which the world may not be able to maintain if used at the current rate for more than a few decades anyway.</p><br><p>However, there are other problems associated with atmospheric carbon sequestration, as well as with carbon capture via burning of fossil fuels. So there's still some room to explore, and the problem is still potentially both serious and solvable.</p><br><p>So I thought I should write a post to make it a bit clearer what the problem is, in the hope that people can start discussing and brainstorming solutions at this interesting cross between engineering and social change.</p><br><p>For this post, I'm going to focus on the anthropogenic CO2 problem. I will use a specific number at the start for brevity; the actual number in this post is not quite as extreme as the one I gave, but I'd say that we are already quite close to the worst-case climate change scenario and have already passed the point where even a relatively small increase could do a lot of damage by shifting the world into an unknown and potentially unworkable region.</p><br><p>My basic conclusion is that people can reasonably expect future governments, companies, and charities to get pretty interested in both the problem and the solutions, and have lots already on their hands (for climate change reasons or other reasons).  So at least from an investor or donor perspective, it's not as bad as it looks, although it would probably be still worth buying/\xe2\x80\x8binvesting in some good climate change mitigation fund or charity if you can find one that is.</p><br><p>I would be happy for people to use this post as a starting point for discussion, and of course I'm looking forward to responding to any and all comments and discussion!</p><br><p>Background. What's going wrong?</p><br><p>Since the mid-20th century, CO2 concentrations have increased by <strong>35%</strong>. More than half of this increase has been caused by human activity, which is a larger portion than anything else, and as our emissions continue to increase further, the portion due to human activity will again likely soon surpass the other components.</p><br><p>At the same time, the average global temperature has increased in the same period by <strong>5.6</strong>\xc2\xb0C. This may be some of that other "problem"\xe2\x80\x94it's unclear whether this effect is driven by more CO2 or by <em>something else</em>, or some combination of things.</p><br><p>The most likely way I can see that things could turn out poorly is if we (and the future generations of us) get locked into a region that is too hot (because of anthropogenic warming) and/\xe2\x80\x8bor too cold for too long (because of a combination of warming and cooling factors).  If human civilization starts being unable to survive, that could cause human extinction and likely collapse of civilization, and that would be bad and worth trying to prevent. It's a bit hard to estimate how bad it would be\xe2\x80\x94we don't really know the capabilities and limits of today's civilization. But, it's definitely pretty bad news. My guess is that the most likely outcome is we will probably just be locked into a region where we cannot really survive without some massive intervention.</p><br><p>\tHow will the problem occur?</p><br><p>I claim that increasing a bit more the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is likely to cause enough change to lock us into an unknown and possibly unworkable region of the world. The rate of increase is the issue: if it's very fast, then maybe the problem can be solved, if not, we're locked in for life. Let's assume that it's pretty fast\xe2\x80\x94perhaps doubling every decade or few decades. So in 25 years from now, the air will have ten times as much as it does currently. Ten times the CO2 concentration corresponds to about a third of the difference in today's CO2 level and that of pre-industrial times: today it's around __417__ppm and pre-industrial times was about __280__ppm.</p><br><p>That seems like a scary thing to be locking ourselves into. To illustrate: in a very simple equation there is just one variable, <strong>R</strong>, which in this case is the factor by which warming affects how warm. We're interested in the case where <strong>R</strong> is very large. But if <strong>R</strong>&lt;1, then changing the temperature doesn't affect <strong>R</strong> at all. That's probably still ok\xe2\x80\x94it's more about how much we care about <strong>R</strong>. But at least right now, we're almost certainly living in <strong>R</strong> much bigger than one.</p><br><p>Here's the way that such a feedback mechanism could play out in a simplified way:</p><br><p>Let's first just ignore the CO2. Even if it's just a <em>little bit</em> that it raises CO2 levels, if we increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 1% <em>on our current emissions trajectory</em>, then that is likely to cause 2-80% change in temperature over the next 100 years or so.[1] Now imagine we just keep doing that every year, doubling CO2 levels in the atmosphere each time, and compare the outcome today with one where we somehow managed to keep things stable. This would lead to a temperature increase of at least <strong>5.1</strong>\xc2\xb0C:</p><br><p>We wouldn't have much control over <em>when</em> we lock ourselves into such a feedback loop. If we did try to reduce the amounts of carbon emitted, but didn't succeed, the loop would probably get locked into place over a hundred years. And even if we did succeed, it would be much too slow for us to just keep emitting as much carbon as we currently are.</p><br><p>What can we do about it?</p><br><p><strong>A.</strong> The most obvious thing would be to decrease emissions, which would likely be sufficient to keep the world under some level of temperature that would be safe for life. (Probably just under the limit where things are sufficiently bad they could affect human survival.) In that case, we would <em>probably</em> not lock ourselves into such an obviously bad outcome:</p><br><p><strong>B.</strong> The problem is already locked into place and is probably going to be too late to change. The only solution is to find a way to solve the problem directly. We can do some of that by just <em>keeping an eye on things</em> and making sure that we don't lock in a bad outcome too early. And we already are!</p><br><p>If we somehow manage to keep the amount of CO2 and temperatures within some reasonably workable range, then a different problem may present itself: it seems likely that we would start locking into a region where human civilization could not survive. One major reason that people believe that this isn't happening already is that carbon dioxide concentrations do not rise quickly. The Earth only started warming a few decades ago, so human civilization would need hundreds of years to be able to adapt in that situation. Humans have been able to cope with large temperature changes in the past with little problem, such as in the period between the last few ice ages and when humans first entered the northern hemisphere. Some people expect that this transition between ice ages and warming will end this time:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
