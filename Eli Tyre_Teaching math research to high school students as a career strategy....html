A single year of instruction can make them a few percent more capable and motivated and skilled at a wide variety of cognitive activities, because you've brought up a level that they were capable of (but didn't know how to use) to their attention. </p><br><p>I think there's a reasonable chance that by the very beginning, at least some students have not even realized the potential they could reach, because they haven't encountered it in their school work.</p><br><p>One of the goals of this project is to find a good way to explain to such students that their life experiences in school aren't the most important thing they can be doing with their lives, and that their potential as people who take part in a high stakes process of intellectual development isn't being fully realized by their schoolwork. </p><br><p>So I would now like to ask, what kinds of statements can be made that would cause the students to actually become interested in actually <em>researching math?</em> </p><br><p>The second goal of the project, of course, is that I would like to find a really good math program to teach in high school, that teaches to the point of actually <em>helping</em> the kids in some ways that would make them interested in really learning the material. And that we have at least some people that actually know what they're talking about to evaluate these programs, and to see whether there are things that are missing, or whether there are things they're over-doing. </p><br><p>A third goal of the project is that I would also like the program to not require my students to be exceptional at math in the first place. The last lesson they will receive on some of the harder problems will be the last lesson they learn in high school, and my goal is that they not have to learn that hard work just keeps not working unless they've found their way around the problem by other, and more effective means.</p><br><p>And I would love it if we could at least find some students who are <em>not</em> interested in research, but who can understand the message <em>from</em> a student who is, and who can also evaluate math programs for effectiveness. </p><br><p>What does LW think?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
