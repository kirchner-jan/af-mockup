<p>"The Sun goes around the Earth!"</p>
</blockquote><br><p>An Intuitive Explanation.</p><br><p>"The Earth goes around the Sun!"</p><br><p>A technical explanation is a description:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The center of the Sun is at the Earth's center. The Sun goes around the center of the Earth at a constant speed. The radius of the Earth is six thousand miles. The radius of Mars is seven thousand miles. The center of the Earth is sixty thousand miles from the center of Earth. The center of Mars is four thousand miles from the Sun. (The center of the Earth and the center of Mars are not at the same elevation.) If you know the speed of the Sun and the Earth, you can calculate what time it is.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>If you move the Sun a million miles to the right (counterclockwise), it will be on Mars rather than Earth; if you move the Earth a million miles to your left (clockwise), it'll be on Earth rather than Mars. If you move the center of the Sun and (without moving the rest of the universe) rotate the Sun around itself, without changing the Earth's movement or the rest of the orbits, the Sun will rise on Earth and set on Mars.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Technical Explanation #1.</p><br><p>Now consider an <em>intuitive</em> argument, where the speaker <em>just</em> looks for <em>things to do with math,</em> instead of first thinking, "Can I <em>define</em> a <em>model</em>, a <em>theory,</em> from this observation?"</p><br><p>But now suppose that we are hearing an <em>intuitive</em> presentation of <em>technical</em> understanding\xe2\x80\x94not an <em>intuitive</em> defense of the <em>technical</em> explanation. In this case, the speaker thinks, "That's <em>interesting.</em> Let's see if I can derive this <em>technical</em> understanding from this <em>interesting</em> intuition!"  And, instead of first formulating a <em>model</em> of what it <em>means</em> for <em>the Earth</em> to <em>move closer</em> to the <em>Sun</em>...</p><br><p>Then instead of first saying "In the <em>model</em>...", the speaker says "I see the two distances. Why are they related?" and then goes on to talk about the center of the two solar systems, as seen from the center of the solar system\xe2\x80\x94saying how you could in principle work out the precise relationships between these observations of distance.</p><br><p>Then the model is being <em>built up</em> from the <em>intuitive</em> premises. I'm not telling you, abstractly, that the Sun and the Moon revolve around the Earth. I'm showing you how this abstract thing relates to what I'm <em>trying</em> to talk about when I refer to the "center of the solar system".</p><br><p>Or in plain English, an intuitive presentation of <em>technical explainer</em> means we're working from the premise that the Sun revolves around the center of Mars, and then <em>derive</em> the conclusion that the center of Earth is also six thousand miles away, and that the center of the Moon is about two thousand miles away.</p><br><p>An <em>intuition</em> is a set of beliefs like that\xe2\x80\x94which <em>support</em> the existence of solar-system-circumnavigation theory, <em>in the same sense</em> that belief in the Earth's motion supposes motion-based gravity in much the same way that belief in the Moon's motion supposes that the Moon moves independently of the Earth. A belief which <em>supports</em> the theory has to be true under the theory.</p><br><p>In particular, our belief in "distance to the center" is <em>supposed to be</em> a consequence of the <em>underlying</em> belief in "solar-system-circumvention".  <em>Both</em> the belief in "distance", and the belief in "satellite-distances", are intended to be consequences of the "satellite-theory".</p><br><p>Now suppose that we are trying to <em>visualize</em> what the <em>intuitive</em> argument for the technical argument looks like. We're trying to put the words into an <em>intuitive</em> picture. What makes the <em>intuitive</em> presentation <em>intuitional</em> is that the speaker is trying to draw conclusions from <em>interesting</em> arguments, <em>in contrast</em> to trying to draw conclusions which are <em>entirely</em> derived from interesting beliefs.</p><br><p>Visualize the <em>intuitional-visualization</em> and you will end up seeing the whole thing at once.</p><br><p>This is closely related to the problem of counteranalogy, which occurs when you have an <em>intuitive</em> impression of something, and then have to visualize <em>that</em> as an <em>analogous</em> thing, and it sounds like the thing-you-'re-imagining. Which can be a problem in general, or even very specifically, because the analogy isn't perfect.</p><br><p>A simple example:  We have a clear impression that apples fall to Earth in a straight line. But if you think of this as an analogy, like, say, an apple falling as the rest of the solar system turns, in the center of a vast expanding sphere\xe2\x80\x94as the sun, and other stars, and all the other planets with which the moon is gravitating, and all the distant galaxies into which the Milky Way is gravitating, will turn around the sun\xe2\x80\x94then it sounds like the apple will go <em>up</em> through the expanding sphere of the stars, without ever coming down.</p><br><p>So the <em>intuition that "An apple falls in a straight line!"</em> goes out the window. On the way there, however, we were <em>talking</em> about apples falling in straight lines...</p><br><p>Technical explanation #2.</p><br><p>...whereupon I said:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>So I will now try to define a notion of explanation in terms of the intuitive notion of "analogy", which sounds suspiciously like the notion of building up a picture from a belief, by analogy with pictures which support the belief.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>In the case of a counterargument, analogizing the conclusion to some assumption with a different conclusion, sounds suspiciously like building the picture from the assumption! An explanation is a belief about an already visualized phenomenon. The notion of a counterargument is <em>really very similar</em> an intuitive notion of argument from an analogy, as it really is, and it's really <em>quite suspicious</em> that I just declared that something which sounds so similar to an intuitive notion of "argument from analogy" should be included as a part of "explain" by a Bayesian definition of "explanation".</p><br><p>...</p><br><p>And then I went on to give an extended argument that a visual analogy is <em>not</em> what I meant.</p><br><p>Technical Explanations are all <em>intuitions</em>\xe2\x80\x94beliefs, or visualizations as the case may be.</p><br><p>The notion of a technical explanation as a statement about a specific "explanatory hypothesis" is a formalization of an intuitive notion of explanation.</p><br><p>But the formalization is <em>wrong\xe2\x80\x94_for many reasons, some of which are currently coming due\xe2\x80\x94at least from the perspective of someone who does not _already have</em> a technical understanding of a body of knowledge. This means that someone who isn't trying to teach someone from scratch, but are simply trying to talk about what they can see, doesn't say things like, "The center of Earth is six thousand light years from the Sun," because they <em>already know</em> the physical model which says that the center of both solar systems is six thousand light-years from the Sun.</p><br><p>So a technical explanation of a technical explanation is...</p><br><p>...a formalization for someone who already has a technical model, but is trying to explain to someone who doesn't, and doesn't think in terms of physical equations.</p><br><p><em>Analogy</em> is a notion from first-pass <em>general knowledge about the world.</em> A good analogy is one that supports lots of <em>conclusions.</em> It's not a good analogy if you can't see the analogical model, to support your analogy with the thing you're trying to explain.</p><br><p>But this is not because we <em>haven't tried hard enough</em> to find models. It's because the analogy <em>should already</em> be pretty good. The <em>intuition for</em> the analogy <em>should be</em> pretty good; <em>the fact</em> that it's pretty good should show up in the <em>conclusion</em>. If someone hasn't thought much about the <em>specific models</em>, then the <em>reason</em> the model is pretty good, shouldn't be a point in its favor.</p><br><p>The models should be <em>trying to support the conclusion</em>\xe2\x80\x94for us <em>already</em> to have beliefs that, on their own, show it.</p><br><p>And <em>this is not a problem for "good faith".</em> It is not a question of trying to <em>sell</em> the <em>technical</em> model, and trying to sound plausible in the process. If the model is actually pretty good, you don't <em>need</em> to argue for it. You can just <em>talk</em> about it.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
