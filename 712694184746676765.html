I don't want to complain here too much, I think Paul did do some good work and it is nice to see him getting back at it. Nonetheless, some things occurred to me: </p><br><p>1) I find the first comment here. Here it would go something like this:  I am a pretty good scientist. I study physics, and make a lot of experimental observations. I have spent quite some time thinking about how to make science actually work, and I am pretty sure I have found a big problem. I think I have a system that I am pretty excited about, but haven't really put it to work.  (There is something about the fact that science has existed for a long time but we didn't have the language to describe it in. It turns out that with the internet we have a very good ability to describe a lot of things, and to coordinate a very interesting project!)</p><br><p>2) I want to be very suspicious about the second comment, especially because the title suggests that things have changed.  If I was a physicist reading that it would be very easy to get excited, and then I saw:  "We have a very good system for predicting the results of the experiment when we tell it to, and so I expect we will think we have a pretty good method for predicting the results when we look at the experimental evidence."  This was an important test of science. </p><br><p>3) "You make a lot of good measurements, and come up with a theory and a prediction, then actually make the measurements. Then, at least by some objective standard, you should be able to see if the measurements you made fit the theory or not. See Paul Bays here." – This is almost true, but the only thing that the experimenters really did, was say that they thought that they were better than chance  at coming up with a theory that explains the data. What did we actually do to improve ourselves? That would be the third and most important thing I would like to see described more.</p><br><p>4) "I think I got good answers just by asking the question. There weren't that many smart people there, and so I think I did most of the work. My hypothesis was the most wrong. My answers got the highest score." – the answer to this is that this actually kind of happened! There was this guy whose name is Chris who was very very quick and good at coming up with good answers. His answers were way faster than any of mine. This is not a great way to find the best answers you get. </p><br><p>5) "I know that lots of people are bad at science because someone wrote a blog post about how dumb that person was – they failed to understand something that took a long time to teach, or read a journal article they don't understand the author's point well enough to understand the rest of the paper, etc" – what I find very funny about this is that I think this is exactly the right strategy to get people interested in science. I remember a time recently when a friend who works as a programmer told me that the best way to teach someone who was interested in math what they were missing was to explain it.  "Oh, I think you can just look at the equation, you don't know what it means so you have no context to start with." – This doesn't work! A lot of times people can look at equations and then say, "Oh! That's not like what I've been looking at before! I should read that textbook and talk to my math teacher before asking any more questions."  But that wouldn't work if their first reaction to the equation were, "What on earth is this thing?" It should work best when the response to reading the equation is, "This is a lot of information! Look at this section to see where things are going."</p><br><p>6) "I remember someone who was the only one who had actually gotten the answer to this problem correct. And then one problem after another, there was a lot of good answers, but they were wrong." – I find this very interesting. I want to note that I know this doesn't quite mean that that person is the one who actually got it right, it might just mean that they had a lot of answers that sounded right. But that is interesting, since I think many people's first response to the problem is, "This sounds kind of right. I wonder why I don't think of it."  Or, "The data was noisy. I wonder if I can get a tighter estimate by looking at it in some other way."  I don't think that's right, at least not generally. My sense of it is that there really was one answer that was the best, or at least one that was pretty close to the best.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
