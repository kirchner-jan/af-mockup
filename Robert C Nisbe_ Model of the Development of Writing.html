The problem is more interesting than that. I intend to sketch out the following picture with a minimum of mathematics. The post assumes that the reader can read the text and try to figure out the details (in the appropriate section of the post). Those of you who are not so mathematical can skip the rest of this post. </p><br><p>Let's start with a very simple and primitive device of thought\xe2\x80\x94namely the visual system. We begin by sketching out the shapes in our imaginations. Words for things\xe2\x80\x94the object they stand for in our visual system\xe2\x80\x94is how our abstract thought began. This is where things get interesting.</p><br><p>When we try to describe them in words, the brain must come up with some way of mapping shapes to words. It is also a very clever idea, that it makes the abstract concepts of objects "real" to us by allowing words to represent the abstract shapes that represent the objects. I call that map the "concept map":</p><br><p>"A collection of words or concepts (a map within a map) that represent objects or events in some manner." </p><br><p>The map is made up of the words and the ways in which their shapes "click" together. What is interesting is how it works. We begin by understanding that to find the object the word points to in our imagination, we must find the corresponding concept in the concept map. To simplify the example, suppose that when we say the word "red" what we really have in mind is a circle. So what we will do is use what we know about the map\xe2\x80\x94words and concepts\xe2\x80\x94to find the correct circle of the map.</p><br><p>The map has two dimensions\xe2\x80\x94the length and width of the circle. Let's call that map\xe2\x80\x94which describes the size of the circle\xe2\x80\x94the "word map". Now the thing we are looking at must be in the rectangle bound by the borders of the rectangle. For example, let's try and figure out where the "rose" is in this map. If we want to pick out the circle, then if it is in the blue part of the map it belongs to that word map in concept map:</p><br><p>The process we just reviewed, and one we will use over and over, describes how our maps (concepts, word maps, size maps, and so on) develop. Each map comes later than the one before. We are, however, now beginning to see the development of the map from the basic to the advanced. There are three major steps of development. </p><br><p>The first step is learning to differentiate between concepts, or word maps, from objects, or size maps. The word <em>rose</em> is a concept. The word <em>red</em> is a concept and so is "red ball". So that the word <em>rose</em> will point to a concept in the map in the concept map (from the primitive to the advanced map). If that word <em>rose</em> does come to take on a connotation of a specific rose, that connotation does not come in the word map, but with the concept map.</p><br><p>In the primitive map, the size of the shape of the objects was mapped to words. Now the concept map has evolved. The shape of the circles is no longer mapped to words. That map also has been changed. It is still in the same location, just mapped to a new concept. The concept of size is now mapped to words or to shapes in the same way the words <em>red</em> and <em>rose</em> are mapped. The mapping between the two is through the concept map:</p><br><p>\t"A map (in the more complex sense of the word map) is a representation that is related to the territory, and is stored in memory."</p><br><p>The next step involves learning to map concepts to each other. This is learning to map the word <em>rose _to the word _red.</em> There also exists a map of the word <em>rose,</em> which is in the concept map, and from that map (again through the concept map) the word _rose may well be mapped to another word. Rose_red is a "semantic link".  In the primitive map there is no link. In the early stages of the map there are no links.</p><br><p>"What a wonderful thing! What a wonderful thing!"\xe2\x80\x94Alfred Korzybski </p><br><p>Now we get to the _third _stage, which is learning to think to connect concepts. Before the map develops this ability, it cannot have any links between concepts. What happens when the map develops the link _rose_red. As the map develops, a link is established between the words, and a set of concepts is created in the map. That set may have no real link to any of the original concepts, but the word is established as a link. It connects the concept map to the conceptual map. The map can also connect words to concepts.</p><br><p>The link that we just saw is the _Rose_red concept in the conceptual map. But there can also be links connecting concepts. This is where the most interesting thing happens.</p><br><p>Linked concepts</p><br><p>Let's take a second to talk about linked concepts, and the concept map, which shows the concepts that are connected by the concept map. There are two different things that happen when a concept gains a link. </p><br><p>One is that the concept can become more specific. For example, in a map there were two circles, the word <em>red</em> was mapped to these circles both, and the word _rose\xe2\x80\x94 _red\xe2\x80\x94can be said to be a more specific concept than the concept of red.  </p><br><p>The other concept, is that the conceptual map, itself, may expand. It can connect to a more specific map, the semantic map.    </p><br><p>If you think of the primitive map like a very simple computer program, the concept map is just a computer program with links and connections in it. As you add more links, more concepts, more ideas and connotations, the old map gets crowded out and the newer and more specific map may gain space and be placed upon top of.</p><br><p>"And the rose that's upon it is so red,And thats not the color right either.</p><br><p>_I tried to think a little while. And I found that I thought before the rose could be red,We must have the word'red', that is not it. And yet\xe2\x80\x94the rose can't be red\xe2\x80\x94"for thats not red.""</p><br><p>In other words, the map can increase in size.</p><br><p>The question then arises\xe2\x80\x94How do we describe the connection between the word map and concept map? The word map and conceptual map can connect but how do they connect?</p><br><p>There are several ways to describe this connection.  </p><br><p>These have the advantage of being able to cover each part of this story.</p><br><p>The concept map and conceptual model</p><br><p>There are words or concepts that are connected to the concept map, by links or by other connections, to the conceptual map (either the semantic map or the conceptual map). In the case of language, the links of the concept map (word map) that connect to the connection of a word or concept in the conceptual model (map of word map) that have more or less the same connotation, are called semantic connections or semantic links.  </p><br><br><p>The links of the conceptual map that connect to the concept map do not carry a "semantic connotation".  They can be connotation links.   </p><br><p>Both concept map and concept model can interact to form an idea, or an abstraction that does exist because of connections between their components. If you have a map of a map, you can think about what it is to be able to see "through" a map, to the territory.</p><br><p>In both cases, we will deal with words, but words map to concepts, not directly. Concepts map directly to the map of concepts. There are no shortcuts. Once you add concepts to be linked, they come in their own time, and do not affect the map of the map of concept map.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
