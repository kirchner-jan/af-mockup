(Also from my last post on LW, How to Convince Me That 2 + 2 = 3. I also found this on Hacker News. I think the same principle applies here: How much more likely do you think "smart people with the same background and knowledge as me" will think your idea is plausible, if you give me an idea? How much less likely? How much difference? As far as I can tell, lots.)</p><br><p>For the purposes of this discussion, consider a typical discussion where two people have an argument about some topic and one side is making an argument that's clearly mistaken and the other side is making a good case. The more intelligence you have, the higher your ability to detect clear mistakes. The more intelligent others believe you to be, the more plausible their own position will be to you, if they agree with you. This doesn't mean everyone should defer to the most intelligent person, but it provides an argument in favor of respecting someone's intellect if they are smart: If I know you're smart, I'm almost guaranteed to believe you more simply because I know you're likely to make a good argument.</p><br><p>A side-effect of this is that people will end up making arguments which are not only wrong, but unrefutable. In the discussion I just had yesterday, some time after I explained the concept of "the argument from authority", several people responded by saying, "That's silly. My argument from authority is even more valid than a 5-year-old's. The kid is just arguing for a side; I'm just trying to be rational. (The conversation moved on to whether that sort of thing is valid in general.) They were very persuasive when they were making the wrong argument, and that made me even more convinced. I don't need intelligence to argue my side; it just takes a smart person to argue against any idiot who's wrong with authority."</p><br><p>In response to the comments on that post, I wanted to emphasize that this doesn't apply for all or even most arguments from authority. I think people often find themselves making arguments that they know are wrong, and find it emotionally painful to give a rational response to an authority-seeming argument.</p><br><p>When I first posted about this, I thought it applied only to non-negotiable "you're fired" situations. But I realized there's a nonlinear relationship between intelligence and authority. The higher the intelligence, the more likely you are to take the other side into account. It's not just a matter of how confident the other side is, but also what your level of uncertainty about their position is, and how smart they are.</p><br><p>Let me offer another example. Say I'm talking to a friend of mine about some important problem she faces right now. Say she thinks she's on the side of rationalists\xe2\x80\x94I'll call her a rationalist friend (RPF). We'll consider various different kinds of possible positions the RPF, myself, and I could take on the matter. I could say, "I'll take the other side of the argument." I could give her different reasons from the other side; for example, I could say "I think you're smarter than the average person, and I think a 5th grad student is smart by US standards, but not nearly smart enough to counter what a college educated RPF would say."</p><br><p>I might have reason to take that position with respect to arguments about specific issues, for example if I know the RPF really understands a complicated argument which I don't know anything about. But the more I know about the RPF, the less likely it is that she'll accept me, and the less I can reasonably expect that I could use her as an authority. If I can, I'll just say "Tell me a bit more about why you think you're right." If I'm dealing with a general knowledge-based argument\xe2\x80\x94for example if I give a nonlinear estimate of how many people are smarter than a 5 yr old\xe2\x80\x94my best bet may be to treat the other side as being intelligent on par with me.</p><br><p>In fact, if I wanted to convince the RPF that I was right about issues that she knows nothing about, I would probably have to come up with my own arguments before I felt comfortable arguing with her about them. I would have to convince her that I was actually right and she was wrong about something pretty important, just as she was probably wrong about something important, and that I could do all of that with a reasonable amount of effort and probably have her agree with me. In other words, the only reason I'd accept her as an authority is if she looks like the sort of person who would probably agree with me once they'd thought about my arguments for themselves.</p><br><p>(I know that this is a bit of a departure from how the average argument works, but I think it applies to a lot of high-stakes arguments.)</p><br><p><strong>ADDED:</strong></p><br><p>For the record, my best guess on how to answer the original question with a real-life example is basically: A 5-year-olds and the average US citizen differ by orders of magnitude on epistemic and instrumental rationality. But, say they come across the same question. If they answer it differently, this doesn't necessarily mean either one is smarter than the other. I'd make a similar bet to the one the original article made with authority; if they answer it differently\xe2\x80\x94if they disagree\xe2\x80\x94this doesn't mean they're stupid or biased. They may just have a different perspective. In fact, I'd be more surprised by people who answered the question differently from the 5-year-older than from someone who was a whole order magnitude smarter. Of course, I'd also be more surprised from someone who was 10 years older, and from someone who was 100 years older than them. But they might have more relevant information.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
