A lot of work has gone into categorizing these\xe2\x80\x94I won't go into the details and I'm sure you could find plenty of papers here to fill in the blanks, if you cared enough. But one thing that seems very clear is that a problem is not a math problem until you get to the answer.</p><br><p>You read a newspaper and come across an interesting claim of fact. The first thought that comes to your head is that you should run the numbers. There's probably a right and wrong answer in your head\xe2\x80\x94even if the real answer is 50.01% and 49.98%, the real answer is still math (because it is the answer to some equation).</p><br><p>You read about a theorem or conjecture that is either interesting or important. There were probably many approaches to proving it or disproving it\xe2\x80\x94there are probably plenty of clever tricks to try. The first thing that comes to your mind isn't that you should prove or disprove it. There are probably other things you could try.</p><br><p>I know someone, in fact, who spent hours proving theorems he knew were obvious\xe2\x80\x94ahem\xe2\x80\x94because he didn't have much to do, actually, so he figured he might as well while he waited for a more interesting problem to show itself. (And you all know the person I'm talking about.)</p><br><p>I don't think that's some kind of mysterious way that things should be done\xe2\x80\x94it's totally understandable, based on what mathematicians are saying now.</p><br><p>What I find confusing in all of this is the way people write about math. For example, in mathematics they are careful to write a lot of papers about how you're about to prove a new theorem or how you'll use a clever trick to prove an old one. These papers give the impression that doing this is not only necessary, but mandatory.</p><br><p>I agree that it is often necessary to do this. But I think it's also often unnecessary (i.e. not the "proper" way to do something is the proper way to do something).</p><br><p>Take the person who knows the argument, and it's obvious that if it's not the clearest and simplest possible argument, someone will come along to disprove it.  "How does one even begin?" I hear you say. "You're going too far, just telling some random person how they are <em>entirely wrong</em> about a math problem, and that this is <em>not how math works</em>, it's just a wrong approach."</p><br><p>Maybe the problem is that math doesn't look like that, but that's okay, you're probably just not yet ready to understand it. Maybe that person has the right to be concerned about where you got to, because you don't know why you're wrong yet. Maybe math is supposed to be hard, so that you may think you have a strong argument in your mind, when really you're just playing a mental version of Russian roulette.</p><br><p>I also agree that it's OK if you're working on a problem and you want to find the shortest and simplest solution that matches the problem description. Sometimes the best solution is not necessarily the one you think it is. But that's not usually the case\xe2\x80\x94the problem description usually gives you enough information to make up the simplest solution that is probably sufficient. Or even if not, it will usually still be some fairly complex solution anyway. It's the case where you don't know what you're doing and it's easy to come up with a simple solution that is just wrong\xe2\x80\x94that's where it might be good to read at least one proof or disproof or two to make sure that the problem statement is sound, and give up and try something else when you realize that.</p><br><p>I'm also a fan of saying a lot of "oops"\xe2\x80\x94it seems to me that there's a tendency to keep looking for ways to prove or disprove the problem until you find something\xe2\x80\x94just because you don't have good reasons to suspect that the argument is sound and that the argument is complete.</p><br><p>All that, and yet I also tend to write down the problem statement. I write it down because I might not remember everything right, and then I realize later that there's no reason I couldn't have used in some case the argument that is sound\xe2\x80\x94what was I thinking???\xe2\x80\x94and then the problem becomes easy.</p><br><p>So, what makes a math problem not a math problem? Is it that you can just <em>read the problem statement</em> and decide that's not a math problem and go on? Or do you have to have a particular type of problem in mind, and have a particular approach to solving it in your head?  What's the rule?</p><br><p>__Followup comment from Vaniver: __It sounds like you're disagreeing with Abram in some way. I want to note that Abram, although this is a strawman, is saying that you <em>don't</em> just read the problem statement. Yes, you might read the problem statement and know that there are "no numbers" involved, but you don't just read the statement and know that it's not a math question. The statement might contain a description of some set or domain in terms of the numbers (e.g. the natural numbers). To have a problem that is not a problem in math, you have to have some sort of constraint that is not satisfied by the problem statement.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
