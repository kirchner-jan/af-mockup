</ul><br><p>This is the first of a few short posts that I'm planning to write about this theme. This post builds up on a discussion over at the EA forum started by Wei Dai.</p><br><p>In the original post, Wei Dai suggested looking into the literature on social roles to see what kind of research has been done. I looked around a bit and ended up coming upon an interesting paper by Dijksterhuis &amp; van Olden (2011) that seemed to have addressed some of my specific questions. In this post, I'll discuss one particular aspect of their paper: the role of hierarchy in organizations.</p><br><p>(If you're already familiar with that research area, then you may know all of the things I'm going to say here.)</p><br><p>Acknowledgements &amp; References</p><br><p>Dijksterhuis and van Olden (2015) is a survey of research on various organizational roles, many of which have been discussed recently on the EA forum. Dijksterhuisd and van Olden cover a lot of terrain. The paper itself (which was written in 2008, by the way) is mostly based on a review of existing research. However, it does reference two main pieces of relevant literature. For one thing, a different area of research that had also been discussed on the EA forum was described at length:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Several recent studies suggest that in organizations, status is related to the degree of commitment and involvement of employees in a task or project, and this relationship may be mediated by the presence of a social role.&gt; The present study shows that a social role is indeed a mediator of the relationship.The paper then describes the theory underlying the importance of hierarchy in organizations, and provides some more detail on existing research:</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>The notion of status as the ultimate determinant of workplace outcomes is not new. The modern workplace is essentially ruled by a hierarchy, and the influence of organizational structures on employee behavior is well documented (Reeves, 1981; Shanteau, 1991). In particular, two main explanations for the effect of organizational hierarchy on task performance have emerged: (1) social hierarchies are used to maintain organizational tasks, (2) organizational structure is used to reward and punish employees.&gt; Social status is defined in terms of social roles that can be occupied in an organization, including such roles as team leader, team member, and subordinate. Because role characteristics are interrelated, individual persons occupy different roles to varying degrees. The role of the person thus is determined by social and informational networks which include others who have already occupied similar roles. Dijksterhus and van Olden call the relationship between role occupance and task performance the "cognitive representativeness" model (Pashler &amp; Hintze, 1994). One of the central aspects of this model is the similarity tendency: individuals tend to assume other role identities are similar to their own identity. Hierarchical structure is thus assumed to increase cognitive representativeness in one of the two situations: first, it may increase representativeness as individuals in general are assumed to play similar roles; second, it can also increase representativeness of more "specific" roles.&gt; For the cognitive representativeness model, social and informational networks can take on different roles. Networks in which roles are occupied in different degrees lead to different representativeness.&gt; Some research also suggests that the amount of task information needed to perform a task is lower if the person occupying the role does it to some degree than if no one does it at all (Manktelow, 1987; Shanteau et al., 1990; Rittenauer &amp; Hintze 1990; Rittenaur, 1990, 1991). This would be expected because if the role is less specific, the individual, even if acting alone, would need less information to perform it to its optimum. Hierarchy is therefore assumed to lower representativeness.Other aspects of the theory of the role of hierarchy were covered in depth, as well as some specific research papers that shed light on the topic. There isn't room for all of this research in here; the details are too spread across all kinds of studies. So I'll simply refer you to the paper itself for more details on the whole theory.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I'm going to break up this post into three sections: the background, the generalization, and the applications. </p><br><p>Generalizing across roles</p><br><p>The Copenhagen Interpretation</p><br><p>In the 1960s, American physicist Niels Bohr made a surprising and provocative claim about the relationship between atoms and the universe. He said that the atomic nucleus was not a single, discrete object which was made up of particles and which we could model mathematically. Instead he said that it was a sort of "mathematical cloud" inside the nucleus, made of waves and interactions that did not fit into the math of quantum mechanics, which described the world at large.</p><br><p>In this view of the atom, Bohr said that the behavior of an atom was "more continuous" than it looked. "Continuity" in the Bohr view means that there is no sharp distinction between different electron configurations of an atom. (When talking about a cloud of amplitude inside of the atom, one can say that a discrete electron configuration is simply one possible shape for the cloud.) </p><br><p>The Bohr model was considered unlikely at the time, since the math of quantum theory did not describe such things. Still, Bohr would not give up. He did a lot of experimental testing to confirm his model, and published his theory. And although it later turned out that it was mistaken, the ideas it set out were found to be more correct than most of the other interpretations, as well as being useful enough that they remained in use until the 1970s.</p><br><p>The Bohr Model</p><br><blockquote>
<p>One idea which was put forward in order to justify and promote this model of the "cloud" was the "Copenhagen Interpretation", first developed by the early quantum theorist Oskar Klein (Klein, 1954). The Copenhagen Interpretation made the prediction that a "cloud" in the nucleus would cause the experimentally observed line shifts which result from the electron's velocity. The implication was that an electron could enter and leave the nucleus by jumping a distance which depended on its velocity, in analogy with the way the classical theory of motion predicted the classical equation relating velocity to distance.The Copenhagen Interpretation also predicted that the energy needed to jump a distance was less as the velocity decreased (and correspondingly increased as the velocity increased), since the electron could interact with the nucleus less strongly as it travelled faster. </p>
</blockquote><br><p>In order to test those predictions, Bohr built a small and simple apparatus whose purpose was to detect how much energy was needed to jump a given distance for various electron velocities. He placed some sensitive metal plates at various distances from an atomically uniform source, and created a small gap between the plates. The source of radiation could then be moved towards the hole between the plates, or away from it. Once the electron configuration of the source was known, the energy needed to perform the jump from the source to the other plate would reveal how much energy was in the cloud.</p><br><p>Then the experiment was actually performed. The results, as predicted, confirmed the Copenhagen Interpretation.</p><br><p>So the Copenhagen interpretation predicts that there are essentially "holes" between the atom, and we're able to block the electron from leaving inside by closing the gap and creating this hole.</p><br><p>The generalization</p><br><p>Wei Dai posed the question: if hierarchy is really only used to reinforce specific tasks, would nonhierarchal organizations have better performance overall? I was intrigued by the idea of investigating what the evidence was like, so that we could be less persuaded by anecdotes than by hard data. To that end, I ended up finding the paper by Srivastava, Greve, &amp; van der Wal (2013), which addressed the following question:</p><br><ul>
<li>Do teams with nonhierarchies outperform their hierarchical counterparts in terms of project quality?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What about cost?</li>
</ul><br><p>They used a dataset that included a large number of projects involving teams, ranging from small (two people) to large (three hundred). The idea was that if hierarchy was simply serving some purpose, the more-hierarchical teams would clearly be inferior in terms of performance. If there was some advantage to hierarchy that was not captured by quality or cost alone, then that would also be evident.</p><br><p>Instead, the results showed that there was little difference in quality, but a significant difference in cost. The researchers found that nonhierarchial teams required fewer resources to complete tasks, and therefore cost fewer dollars. But in the end, since the difference was so small (as in the case of universities, for example), it could not be attributed to any particular factor. So there is little support for the hypothesis that hierarchies are a necessary byproduct of specialization; they might be useful for something other than specialization. But if we think of hierarchy as being merely incidental to task specialization (as in the Bohr model), then specialization might still work better than non-specializing.</p><br><p>This supports earlier research in my own community. I mentioned earlier that an educational expert might be as good at teaching math as a computer programmer, because their specific skill is the same (teaching mathematical concepts and algorithms), but different skills and context. </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
