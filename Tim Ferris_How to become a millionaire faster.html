</ul><br><p>I find the advice in the classic financial book <em>Your Money or Your Life</em> one of the most important (and useful?) things I have learned throughout my life. I've worked my way through it every single year for the past half-century, but it didn't click for me until I read it in my twenties.</p><br><p>When I was nineteen and had just gotten my first paying job and started living on my own, my life revolved around saving money, spending money, getting more money, and generally working harder and smarter. I'd read Peter Drucker, Peter Thiel, and Ben Franklin. I read books about the art of rationality, and took every single economics, math, management, and self-improvement class that I could get my hands on. I spent a decade pursuing higher education. Every year, I went further and further in debt to make it to the next class, and worked <em>hard.</em></p><br><p>And then I got sick.</p><br><p>And that was it. I spent my own money on the best care I could afford, and the rest of my life was in recovery for the cost of it. I didn't start writing this because I thought it would make me rich, I wrote it and wrote it because everything in my brain was still screaming <em>RUBBITS!</em> in a single voice, and I figured I might as well share anyway.</p><br><p>So, back to my original point. I figured if I was going to go through the pain and hard work to become rich, it was worth it if I could get there a lot faster. And I did, by implementing the tactics I learned in <em>Your Money or your Life</em>. I was back in school in 18 months after getting out of rehab, and I paid my last couple hundred thousand dollars for my bachelor's in finance and business while still working a paying job as a cashier and taking every possible class that I could manage. And now I'm going on to save the world using a career in money management.</p><br><p>I'd like to share my tactics because I think you can improve your financial life quite a lot, and I'm confident you can do so much, much faster.</p><br><p>Basic steps</p><br><p>How to find a product we believe in</p><br><p>There are a few different things I like the book for, but the most important is for my friend-recovery-from-addiction-using-heroin.</p><br><p>As it happens, I personally had an <em>awful</em> past with heroin. I was involved through several phases with the drug, and at points spent several months living in a rough circle of dealers and "friends" from which I gradually moved toward recovery and clean living. Along the way, I realized that the reason I used the drug was because it was cheap enough that I could afford it, but then I also noticed that I had a strong intrinsic desire to use the drug. I was trying to be responsible, but I still wanted it. What I hadn't recognized at the time is that _that was the _wrong pattern for me\xe2\x80\x94all I should have done was stop doing it.</p><br><p>So I tried to find another way to get heroin cheap. The same thing occurred: I found a dealer to buy it from, but they wanted too much, so I started looking for different dealers to try to get my dose cheaper. Again, the same thing happened: my dealer would tell them "that guy can't afford it", but when I looked through his notebook and saw pictures of expensive homes, expensive cars, and expensive women, I saw the proof of what they were saying. And my desire to get high more than canceled out what they claimed the guy I was looking at couldn't afford.</p><br><p>This repeated until I started asking myself "is this guy's problem here?" and asking my girlfriends "what do you think the chances are he's lying?". Then I found the website [redacted] to help me out. They had a user rating where the top ratings are for the people who tell it like it is, and the bottom ratings are for people who want to lie.</p><br><p>I made my purchase in a black box where there was no website, and no real middleman, and with a phone number for a guy I knew that was good at finding and shipping drugs. I got a perfect score based on the user rating. Heroin ended up half the price it had been, and I started off clean and happy for the next few months.</p><br><p>I think this is the best example of how to use the method: if your problem is a difficult set of circumstances that you can't change in the short term\xe2\x80\x94if you can't solve it yourself by improving your circumstances or learning from the problem before it gets worst\xe2\x80\x94then go look for a method out there in the world of problems that are just as, or more, difficult, but with an element of "you can make a difference" and "you can do it yourself and get a good result at the end\xe2\x80\x94but I'd have to be right to be you".</p><br><p>And then use the product to satisfy that intrinsic desire.</p><br><p>How to spend more</p><br><p>_"Spend money on experiences, not things." _</p><br><p><em>- Ben Franklin</em></p><br><p>I am the kind of guy who spends money fast, and this was a period of life where money was very, very important. When I was seventeen and in the middle of my recovery from heroin, I had an ex who was about to give me back the keys. I started dating this ex (my first girlfriend) because I knew even then I was a good relationship and had an excellent ability to spend. But I was so poor at the time, and so uncertain of my ability to keep going back to school and living in the house I shared with my ex's friends, that I was terrified at the very idea of being seen with the exact same ex by anyone.</p><br><p>So after the breakup with my ex, I did the only thing I could think of to get money\xe2\x80\x94I signed up for a telemarketing company with a friend. Every morning while I showered at work and got dressed, I'd get a call from some other dude I knew. He would tell me that he was a personal trainer at a sports clinic, and wanted to learn how to market himself enough to give me training sessions, and I was excited because I knew I would <em>lose so much</em> working out with him. I went through a period of about a year where every time he called me and mentioned he was about to start training me, I would yell "no! no! don't come at <em>all!</em> I'm scared of your training!"</p><br><p>So after that, I went out in all these clubs and bars where there would be a table full of people in business suits with drinks in front of them. I'd sit down, and a lot of guys would be staring at me thinking: <em>Who the hell are you, what do you want, and why should I give it to you for absolutely nothing?</em> And I'd notice some of those suit guys at the table would look at me, too, because <em>if you can't stare down business-suit guys, who can you stare down? _And I'd think to myself that _if I could just ignore the suit guys and make their eyes go empty and wait long enough, if I could just stare down _enough</em> people..._</p><br><p>What I learned from this period was that I had a real problem. I did not have the skills to get enough money for a place to live, and I didn't have the skills to ignore the stares of suit guys and stare down anyone, and in fact wasn't able to do either. But a guy in a suit <em>can get hired fast</em> if he talks fast and makes people feel like he can take care of them.</p><br><p>Once I'd gone from being unemployed, broke, living in a black hole shared with heroin users, and in constant danger of my life getting wrecked from my ex or her friends being exposed, to being able to be employed and living in a house, in a neighborhood that included a police officer I knew who liked me and would talk on the phone with me without a manager there, it was amazing, but it also taught me that <em>money is awesome</em>. Because once I was spending money on experiences instead of stuff like heroin, I was happier, and more in control of my life.</p><br><p>How I'm going to save you money while learning to save the world</p><br><p>There are few people who are actually interested in my work. I got a job at a finance company as a bookkeeper at $25 an hour, but I was making around $13,000 a year before the pandemic, and the people there were really only interested in making sure I was earning my salary and nothing else. I was happy with that, but I knew that saving a lot of money in the year we're in was critical, so I looked around for ways to learn and get skills while making a small amount of money.</p><br><p>I went to school (yes, I went back to school). I started working out at my local gym. I started learning how to program computer code in my spare time. I also kept talking with the finance guys.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
