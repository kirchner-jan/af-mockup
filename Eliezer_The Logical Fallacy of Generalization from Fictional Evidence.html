(Note that you could still think in terms of logic and factual belief the same way, but at the very front of your mind.)</p><br><p>The fact that one thing can have two distinct, nonoverlapping meanings will hopefully be obvious by now.</p><br><p>When we <em>know</em> a statement to be false, our brains have their own special mental operation where they look at the statement, and they <em>say</em>:  Wait a minute, if that statement is false, then what am I <em>actually</em> believing, here? And they say out loud to you "Oh! I'm actually believing a false statement now!"</p><br><p>But in this sort of case, you can't trust your own mind\xe2\x80\x94the one operating under logic, the one with the conscious beliefs\xe2\x80\x94in most cases at all, because the operation of questioning logic can get lost in the act of questioning it.</p><br><p>At any rate, <em>the question we want answered</em> is this:  When we hear about this amazing thing that just happened, is it likelier to be true or false if the Amazing Thing is from a "factual" source, or from a "story"?  How different would things be, in this case, if some of the details had been lifted out of a science fiction novel?</p><br><p>It's true that a story can be <em>good</em>, even without being true. If we think of the universe as one big story, then it's more interesting, and we find it easier to empathize, and we get a greater emotional kick out of it. That doesn't mean we should just assume that everything in a good story is true.</p><br><p>So the question is this:  If you knew that Robin Hanson was the father of some child, and that Robin Hanson was telling you a good story but not actually being honest by mentioning the fact, would you know that Hanson was probably lying outright?</p><br><p>We could try an exact mathematical statement of this question, but I doubt that the intuition here is too far from the mathematical statement. If I was imagining the <em>process</em> of an honest and honest-seeming storyteller and a dishonest and dishonest-seeming one\xe2\x80\x94but the two stories didn't have other facts in common\xe2\x80\x94would the honest-seeming person actually believe "His statement is more likely to be true, if the rest of the detail is lifted out of a story" as strongly as if he were actually <em>listening</em> to a storyteller in a universe he knew to be fake? And could a sufficiently honest storyteller really think that statement, without changing his thoughts in any way?</p><br><p>You really don't want to confuse honesty and honesty-seeming.</p><br><p>But let's try to be specific about the part about lifted-out-of-a-story, versus actually-being-true. Suppose that one storyteller, the liar, starts his conversation as follows.  "I met someone at an exotic planet, and he gave me this gift, and I thought that I'd share it with you even though it's not the sort of thing I usually share...".  Then he pulls out a golden ring from his pouch, and offers to show you that ring. You peer at it closely, and eventually say, "I'm afraid it's not a ring\xe2\x80\x94it's more like..."  Then Hanson cuts you off, and hands it over. It's really a ring, in a plain, ordinary-looking brown leather box, and it's an impressive ring, with an awesome engraving on it, showing a big red apple.</p><br><p>If this story really happened, then Hanson would be lying if he told you "That guy gave me this ring, and here's my box and a nice red apple, don't you think he's a great guy?".</p><br><p>If a story's real-life characters are all super-geniuses and the plot centers around <em>their</em> super-genius character, or if the story involves really powerful AIs, then the super-genius parts might <em>sound</em> like a true story of an alien spaceship...  But the <em>rest</em> of the story is just a story. It's a <em>lie</em>.</p><br><p>Let me repeat that:  A story which involves <em>real</em> super-geniuses, <em>real</em> AIs that take over the world, and <em>real</em> aliens who come to Earth is, in general, <em>not real</em>. You should not <em>believe</em> that you know anything <em>more</em> about it than you do about an alien spaceship.</p><br><p>You can believe the story might come from space-faring aliens, and still accept that human scientists will explain the spaceship the next year after the aliens finish building it, and that you could never possibly know about it before an hour after it happened in 2012, and have no way of convincing your friend that anything actually happened in 2012, just because there's a good rumor that a spaceship was seen over in that part of the sky back in the early 90s.</p><br><p>But as soon as you realize that somebody who says he saw a spaceship in the 90s, is probably lying, then you realize <em>all</em> stories involving alien spaceships are probably lies. You don't think it's a question of whether it would "sound a <em>bit _like a real alien story".  It doesn't _sound like</em> anything. It doesn't <em>seem _like any plausible story that humans would make up. The alien storyline didn't even make the list of all possible things humans think about space-travel, I would guess. Even when trying to come up with an actual real-life real-time scenario that you'd reasonably expect an honest alien to invent if they were real, it doesn't sound like an alien story\xe2\x80\x94it doesn't seem _suspicious</em>.</p><br><p>Hanson <em>really did</em> go and meet a guy at an alien planet and get given an incredible ring with an engraving on. That is what an honest alien would probably think it might be like, if there were aliens who did things like that.</p><br><p>There isn't anyone who could honestly tell you that story without either thinking up a lie, or trying to deceive you by _simulating _a lie, or thinking up some other strange and possibly untrustworthy thought pattern. Or a combination of those four things.</p><br><p>There just aren't <em>that many</em> stories which could be told that would convince <em>someone</em> to believe something. The fact is, you can't build a coherent internal narrative of how a group of aliens might end up here and meet Robin Hanson, and then go to a <em>planet</em> instead of an alien colony that wasn't mentioned in the story.</p><br><p>An alien story _might _sound like a true alien story, and this can get people to believe it. But it would _sound less like a human story _than any of the stories that just consist of somebody hearing Robin Hanson try to explain something to them.</p><br><p>Robin Hanson is not an alien. The part of his brain that produces a false internal narrative is not much larger than any other part of your brain that generates a false internal narrative. It's possible to generate an internal narrative which <em>sounds</em> like it's from an alien civilization, when you're actually seeing a story about a human brain. You won't believe that claim <em>even if you know it's false</em>.</p><br><p>This is why a fictional story can make you skeptical of non-fictional claims; but a real life alien story would not make you disbelieve Hanson's claim\xe2\x80\x94at least not if you <em>believed</em> him in the first place.</p><br><p>(But if you knew you were being deceived by a story made by someone who wasn't Robin Hanson, it may still be true that your friend's belief in a real alien might become <em>more</em> likely if he were to read and believe the same story himself. People do weird things when they've been deceived into thinking they're a certain way.)</p><br><p>I find this line of reasoning, as applied to fictional evidence, even <em>more</em> disturbing, because it points out the extent to which <em>all</em> our false beliefs can come only from an effort to deceive or be deceived.  (And the more you know about cognitive biases, the easier it is to tell the difference between cognitive biases which are a result of rational design, and those which came from other minds by accident).</p><br><p>In this case, it's not as if the story is being <em>told</em> by someone who's <em>believed</em> it by themselves, but rather, someone who is trying to persuade us, or simply <em>telling themselves</em> that they've been persuaded\xe2\x80\x94you could say, they're <em>relying</em> on the fact that they happened to get into a story. In fiction, even one of those self-deluded stories can be _believed in _by a mind sufficiently similar to ours.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
