It is not a matter of fact\xe2\x80\x94I mean, you <em>know</em> both statements. But neither is the <em>stronger</em> statement, which is that saying that the future will be as exciting as <em>The Time Machine</em> doesn't <em>make</em> the future any more likely\xe2\x80\x94it doesn't alter the laws of cause and effect.</p><br><p>So it's not <em>so much</em> exciting, is it?  <em>E. Y. said:  "You know, the future's so much more exciting."</em>  This statement does not correspond to experience. The future's so much less exciting than <em>The Time Machine.</em>  I am not just saying that things could be as exciting as I imagine them, because you don't <em>know</em> the imagined scenario, and it might be far more exciting. I am <em>being</em> precise here.</p><br><p>If you <em>can imagine _experience with the singularity\xe2\x80\x94if you can see the future _in your mind's eye,</em> which you have only imagined\xe2\x80\x94then we can talk about <em>that</em> as an event that has a chance of actually <em>happening</em>, you might say. It's not so much that this is <em>your</em> mind being the witness of the whole thing; but the claim is that you see the future and the future actually happens and you are in fact there.</p><br><p>But if you talk about "that has a chance of really happening," then you still have to do the standard step in analyzing future scenarios, and <em>see how much more exciting they are</em>\xe2\x80\x94how much more likely you think they are, how much more likely you are to anticipate them, how much more exciting their actual outcome might be. And when I said, "The future's so much <em>less</em> exciting than <em>The Way Things Could Be</em>," I do not mean just that we haven't invented superintelligent AI yet. I mean that, in the <em>standard</em> probability analysis of the singularity, it's the most unlikely scenario that you know about\xe2\x80\x94the least likely thing that's ever happened, so far.</p><br><p>"But that sounds like the sort of thing I do," I observed.  "An unspoken intuition pump. The thing people use to generate future speculations, and the thing that drives them forward. It's a habit of thought."</p><br><p>"It sounds that way," someone said, "but it's also something your brain just learns to do automatically, so much so that it sounds odd if you try to say out loud 'This is a habit of thought I have created in my own brain; please tell me how I could have learned that habit of automatic thought, such that I now can do it even when I'm conscious.' It wouldn't make sense."</p><br><p>"Do you happen to know about a cognitive bias which makes people forget they are creating such a habit of thought? Can you name the bias?"</p><br><p>It was a good question, but I don't think that it had been named yet. So I answered it, and went on to the next question:  "But of course you <em>can</em> say out loud how you know the thought. This is not the habit of thought you learned by thinking it automatically. You can say it out loud. You have remembered the original impulse, and put it <em>back on autopilot</em> for the question at hand."</p><br><p>After that, I noticed we were running out of time, and suggested continuing the conversation at some unspecified future location.</p><br><p>It seems clear to me, after the fact, that my own question-answering habit was not <em>automatically</em> going on\xe2\x80\x94that it didn't <em>just happen</em>; it was <em>created.</em> And I'm pretty sure it would have been different for someone else who didn't already have the question-answerving habit\xe2\x80\x94though to predict the exact thing you've just learned, you would have to watch yourself using it, if you actually saw the future in your own mind.</p><br><p>I do know of a technique that can, I think, be used to automatically put questions back on autopilot, by taking one particular element of conscious experience entirely out of your decision-making\xe2\x80\x94taking it out of your decision procedure\xe2\x80\x94so that you think you can't <em>tell whether to do</em> any particular conscious thing!</p><br><p>And this is one of the very keys to building Friendly AI. I will describe the theory later; for now it is just a reminder that your mind is <em>made of</em> the particular elements of experience that the mind is responsible for choosing to do.</p><br><p>There is a further key to building Friendly AI:  How a <em>single</em> person can go from "I know what I am doing" to "I know that I am not making a decision"; and then how that <em>one</em> new thought about which to behave in terms of the expected utility of its terminal consequences, can take the place of the thousand half-thoughts that are running around in a human brain. This is described in a later post\xe2\x80\x94though it is not the core of the Singularity.</p><br><p>Then to go on from there, to building <em>an Artificial Intelligence</em> which is Friendly and does the job at hand, may require a little bit more creativity than I've shown so far.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
