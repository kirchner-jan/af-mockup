I am also using "group selection" as a synonym for "group selection theory" I will be using the term "group selectionists" to refer to proponents of group selection. __[Note from Richard: __It may be useful to define the term "group-selection Theorists" to refer specifically to the proponents of E.O. Wilson's "Group Selection Theories".]</em></p><br><p>In this post, I discuss what a theory of human evolution would look like if the main driving force behind evolution were group selection. Group selection is the idea that, in many multicellular species, selection pressure is strongest at the level of the species, not least because the genes that are beneficial to the group also replicate more, and hence spread. Suppose that species that have a great many members tend to make offspring with greater reproductive success, and that group selection applies. Why might this be? Why might group selection favour individuals in a species that are most likely to have a great many offspring? </p><br><p>Suppose that we have a group containing a thousand individuals. These could be the cells of a single human, the cells of a group of friends gathered for a party, a group of people fighting a common enemy (and the enemy goes through each member of the group and picks the ones who have done the best, and the group that survives becomes more likely to survive in the future). </p><br><p>If group selection applied, we would expect to see selection pressure in the direction of greater numbers of members. Indeed, we would expect the group to exist for long enough for selection pressure to increase the size of the group to the point where group selection is no longer a good description; we should therefore anticipate the group to have evolved towards larger sizes. At best, this would bring us to the edge of the Dunbar number: groups of about 100 can form stable social networks with complex hierarchies and traditions. But groups as large as a dozen or so are more like independent bands than stable social groups. Group selection predicts a higher level than that.</p><br><p>You could argue, though, that selection still operates on the level of the members. If a gene makes an individual bigger than others, this will decrease the probability that any given individual will be able to reproduce. Individual group selection predicts a lower level than this. A gene that makes everyone in the group bigger but causes them all to reproduce as frequently as they do before is not likely to increase the frequency of the gene in the species. The gene must be increasing some benefit, or else the species must be adapting to the presence of the gene.</p><br><p>So it seems there are two competing theories. One, group selection, predicts that group selection will favour genes that increase group members; the second, individual selection, predicts that individuals in a group will themselves try to increase their numbers.</p><br><p>I have been discussing individual selection (aka group selection modulo individual selection) because I have been discussing the evolution of social systems, but it is also likely relevant to other areas. A famous paper by Stephen J. Gould claimed that the main cause of human evolution was group selection. But now we have the example of the human liver fluke, which replicates at a higher rate than its host. If the parasite could increase its own rate of replication, it would do so and wipe out the host species before its reproductive success had a chance to increase. If the parasite's replication depended on hosts that also reproduce at a high rate (perhaps because the hosts are food sources or because they provide mutual help with finding mates) then it would only do so if the hosts had increased in number as a result of group selection. The individual selection argument for group selection makes no difference to the individual reproductive success of the host; to justify that success, the parasite must be benefiting from group selection, thus ruling out group selection as the main driving force of evolution.</p><br><p>This, of course, is a consequence of evolution by group selection being less powerful than evolution by individual selection. When group selection is a good model, it offers valuable predictions and insights. But the group selectionists should be careful to take the model's limitations into account when proposing new ideas. </p><br><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I realise I have used "individual" and "group" interchangeably. Since group selection for reproductive success can be seen as selection for increased group <em>fertility</em>, it is entirely consistent to assume that group selection favours individuals who have the greatest potential for future fertility; these are members most likely to have great numbers of offspring.</p><br><p>This means that it's misleading to talk about individual selection favouring one group member at the expense of others. What matters is not the fitness of individuals, what matters is the likelihood of a member of the species continuing to contribute genes to the group's next generation vs the probability of the species becoming extinct if it's too large to succeed in competition. Whether selection is driven by individual or group selection is irrelevant.</p><br><p>Of course, it is even easier to see how this argument applies where the reproductive unit is an individual. A bird or insect reproduces in accordance with its biological sex, not in accordance with the group.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
