</ul><br><ul>
<li>How much of that intelligence decline would be predictable years in advance?</li>
</ul><br><ul>

</ul><br><ul>
<li>How much could our experiment be informative about other things?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Would we gain more information about intelligence by studying younger adults than by studying e.g. old people?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How informative might this study be about intelligence?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A larger intelligence decline might be due to age-specific factors not involved in the general decline</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Perhaps intelligence is stable and aging is due to loss of neurons, not to cognitive decline?</li>

I now think I have a pretty good feel for this field, though I'm still not happy about any points I made in the original. The discussion in this comment thread has been the most useful follow-up that I've had to my original post, and I'd recommend checking it out to get more perspectives and perspectives on the topic.]</em></p><br><p><strong>[I've spent so many words describing this topic, so I'm just going to go ahead and present the case for intelligence probably mostly decreasing with age. Most of the evidence for this comes from looking at e.g. humans and chimps, but from other species it seems clear too, e.g. birds and dolphins. I am currently not totally sure that it actually is an intelligence increase (although I don't currently know of any good arguments against it) but I am more open to the idea now than I was a few weeks ago, and I find it fairly persuasive. This is not a debate I plan to be involved in any more than I initially made this post, so I just thought I'd pass the message along.]____A brief summary</strong></p><br><p>If you have an IQ test, it seems like a great test of your intelligence. But if you don't have an IQ test available, there's still a fair number of ways (i.e., all sorts of ways) to indirectly ask yourself to answer a question about what people's "general cognitive abilities" would be like when they're older.</p><br><p>At the very least, it seems like one can infer a fair number of things from the fact that, e.g., humans and chimps and birds seem to be getting smarter at older ages. But if you go looking for answers, you're not just looking for raw intelligence. I mean, maybe chimps were always smarter than dogs, but dogs might be able to learn lots of things more effectively than chimps could. So maybe that's more of a "smartness" test, and chimp "intelligence" isn't necessarily a smaller version of human intelligence at all. And once you know how to test bird and chimp intelligence, how to answer birds and chimp tests is probably a reasonable indicator of how to answer a human intelligence test.</p><br><p>I feel like something I read a while ago said something like, "It doesn't matter whether it's the same exact experiment repeated on ten different birds the same time and the correlation stays the same, on the condition that the birds are all the same age it seems perfectly plausible that if you asked each bird "How smart are you at age 45?" they'd have pretty strong correlations with each other."</p><br><p>In other words, once you take into account the fact that the birds are young, it seems like there's an argument to be made for expecting these relationships even if it's not the case that <em>all</em> the effects seem to come from the same underlying process of intelligence decline.</p><br><p>Of course, in general humans just aren't very good at making these sort of "across-time-trend" comparisons. We only run our intelligence tests once, when we're young. So it's hard to know how much to let cross-time-tangent effects influence our confidence in the claim about human intelligence being more or less stable with age than in the case of other animals. Maybe I should just be more confident that humans and chimps are similar, like I'm about most of my other claims.</p><br><p>But I don't think I'm making any particularly strong assumptions about how human intelligence has gone up over hominin evolution. If chimps had always used their "cognitive enhancement" as an opportunity to outcompete other animals, then their enhanced "intelligence" would almost certainly have been a constant factor in their relative dominance across many environments, and would therefore have remained relatively constant with age. The thing I see in the empirical record is that "humans are getting smarter with age" not (necessarily) as a result of a "cognitive enhancement".</p><br><p>Caveats</p><br><p>"Age" is an incredibly complicated concept, and intelligence may be just one type of thing people are using that doesn't actually have a particularly solid definition. It wouldn't be surprising for there to be some other major way intelligence varies that also does decrease with age, or for it to simply be that both <em>within-species</em> variance and <em>within-population</em> variance decreases with age.</p><br><p>There's a potential problem for this whole line of reasoning with the case we have of some recent (but not too recent) animal species such as elephants, hippos, whales, or dolphins, especially if you are a long-time reader and a longtime fan of AnimalBrains (such as I am). Specifically, people who say there is intelligence (as measured by IQ tests) steadily increasing with age amongst these species, but at such a low rate that it's basically undetectable over a lifetime (if the cognitive enhancement from the "cognitive enhancement technology" described by Eliezer in "Elephants in Translation" is used). But I'm also not an expert, and it may be that whatever cognitive enhancement these species use, it could still be happening within brains that are declining at the time of testing.</p><br><p>So it could very well be the case that there's a huge amount of variation in how "good" a particular species is at solving a cognitive task (even if that is measured on the same test in the same way), e.g. due to things such as whether the species have been trained to do well on it. Such variation leads to a false impression the species are getting smarter with each passing year. And that could be happening even if there's no effect on "intelligence" as commonly measured.</p><br><p>But in general I do not think the absence of these other sources of variance makes the case for intelligence being at least a little bit more stable across a lifetime more compelling. Also, I <em>think</em> intelligence measures like the ones in the IQ test usually decrease with the amount of time spent learning the particular test. But I haven't investigated this very systematically, I would not be at all shocked if there was evidence to the contrary, and I would be highly interested to know about any such evidence.</p><br><p>So my best guess is that if you asked a group of people who are, with a low enough level of training, good enough at simple arithmetic that they could answer questions on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test in the first place, how much have the scores of those people increased with age? Probably by a small amount, and probably not that much. And if there were training required, and the group had been very old when tested, that probably would have been less of a change (but not by <em>enough</em> to actually change the score from below ~50 to above ~70, or whatever). So basically, I think there are probably still <em>many</em> other sources of "goodness at math" variance (which, again, probably decreases with age) that aren't "how smart" you are per se, but rather have to do with your amount of training in some task that involves math thinking.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
