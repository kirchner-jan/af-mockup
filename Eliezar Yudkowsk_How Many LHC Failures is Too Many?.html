For instance, to estimate what the chances are that a single accelerator could kill all the humans in the world with a stray current of electricity, you look up the power capacity of the largest power generators and extrapolate. In practice, most people's estimate of power supply failure probability would be the same no matter the cause, because most power suppliers are overkill. If you can get 1 gigawatt out of 10 power stations, then a stray current of 1 gigawatt through your circuits should kill you.</p><br><p>To make a probability estimate for a super-collIDER <em>specific</em> to a collider, you need to put in some hard thinking. For instance, "how many LHC beams would have hit the Earth if they had gone the other way?" This probability, I find, is <em>not</em> on most people's minds when they think about super-colliders as existential risks.</p><br><p>What is the probability that 10% of the beams coming out the other end of the collider would have hit the earth? It sounds like an incredibly low probability to contemplate, but it's not that hard to think about. I calculated it and got a number between 0.005 and 0.5 per square centimeter of surface area in the Earth. (1% probability in case of a million square centimeters of Earth, 100,000,000 to 100.) This means every square centimeter of Earth's surface has a probability of less than that of a cosmic ray hit per second of <em>not</em> destroying the Earth.</p><br><p>But the odds ratio is even worse than this; most of the calculations I just made are _relative _to the base probability of "we're going to be destroyed by a cosmic ray if we do this thing." If you were worried about all the Earths out of a million, but your estimate puts the cosmic ray probability at 2\xe2\x81\x843, then this is a factor of 3 from my guess per square centimeter, for a total of 0.000333 to 1\xe2\x81\x843. Given that cosmic ray impacts are a constant worry, this factor of less safety is much worse than a factor of 10.</p><br><p>Suppose you have a collider whose beams were not steered, so that they were heading straight for Earth. Now the factor goes from being in the million to being in the billions.</p><br><p>And if the beams were going to any other part of the solar system, say Mars, the Earth-centered calculations take another factor of a billion, and the factors-of-a-billion-to-factors-of-a trillion are probably still around.</p><br><p>So <em>if you add up how many Earths are likely per second per square centimeter</em> the factor is still _way _beyond what would be necessary to even start thinking about existential damage. An accidental collision with a meteorite, let's say, would be just small enough to not even register, since it isn't getting the attention that a cosmic ray strike would be even if it destroyed Earth in such a way that it would destroy the rest of the Solar System.</p><br><p>But if you look at the probability of a specific accident\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a broken beam colliding with the Earth\xe2\x80\x94then you have to get into very difficult physics (and even then the factor gets large fast). The way the LHC is built, as far as I can tell, prevents an accidental beam collision with the ground. A single beam of about a hundred tons of mass, and a million square centimeters or so of Earth's surface, with a few million kilograms of kinetic energy, would do a lot of damage:</p><br><p>But a <em>single beam _of a hundred tons of kinetic energy at _low</em> energies will still have a <em>chance</em> of getting through even a collider made of the best-made parts, since not all particles follow the same laws of motion. So that means the factor goes up by a factor of thousands at least. And that is <em>still _well beyond what would kill _all</em> the humans on Earth. Just so, if an accidental accidental collision by cosmic rays could destroy the Earth in such a fashion as to destroy the rest of solar system and possibly even the galaxy.</p><br><p>So my model of a potential existential disaster\xe2\x80\x94colliders of enough power being built\xe2\x80\x94says "It is very improbable (compared to accidental cosmic ray collisions) that the LHC will destroy all of humanity, but not completely improbable."</p><br><p>This is where the actual thinking begins. For an example of where _my _hardest thinking comes from, see "Beware of Other-Optimizing".</p><br><p>There, I thought that if everyone on Earth cooperated, then if I could stop an existential catastrophe, _the Earth would cooperate. _That sounds very unlikely on the surface, but it means something much more difficult than the "collider disaster".</p><br><p>(This is why I want to know whether it would be possible to _convince _the human species to cooperate if I could avert an existential risk. Not "can I prove that I will save the species" or even "can I prove I am capable of stopping the disaster".)</p><br><p>The question is whether it is possible to _force _the Earth to cooperate if they do not already.</p><br><p>Imagine that this disaster\xe2\x80\x94colliding with Earth\xe2\x80\x94proposes a major change in policy. Then that suggests the Earth is being coerced, not just convinced. There may be other ways to coerce the Earth than to threaten to kill everyone on it.</p><br><p>And remember that coercion works the other way around as well. If someone <em>wants</em> to cooperate, it indicates a way of thinking that is different from that of "collider catastrophe".</p><br><p>(Again, to be clear: I am not talking about someone who <em>cannot make up her mind</em> on whether to cooperate, or someone who thinks she <em>can't make up her mind, _but someone who thinks, _in abstract, without considering Earth's reactions,</em> that cooperation is the better part of valor.)</p><br><p>So if there _is _a way to stop the disaster and then get cooperation from the Earth afterward, then "conforming to Earth's will" probably won't be able to stop it anyway.</p><br><p>There is one more implication I must highlight.</p><br><p>It seems to me that to get such cooperation, I should only have to make a <em>few _small concessions first. If I do not need to concede to all of humanity first, then I am not sure that _any</em> concessions will be required...</p><br><p>For instance, if LHC-level impact is probable, it seems to me that it would make sense to have a nuclear launch system built that could destroy the world on the off-chance that a stray cosmic ray or a few other things happens to hit one of the other nuclear launch systems in such a way as to knock out a few other nuclear launch systems but not the one they'd want to hit. The system could be placed on the upper levels of the atmosphere, or the stratosphere, near the magnetic poles. It seems to me reasonable to expect that such a minor concession would not trigger the collapse of humanity (or the collapse of an almost-human-like species).</p><br><p>The cost to destroy the world with a nuclear or cosmic ray hit would be quite small by comparison to the other risks. I estimate that if, first, we destroy the world with such weapons, there will be about a one in a million chance of a new generation of LHC accidents that end up as a small, minor accident. Assuming that these LHC accidents are more dangerous to humanity than cosmic rays, they would have to occur 1 million times for them to be an effective risk factor against super-colliders, after going through a million accidental accidents.</p><br><p>This implies two small concession:</p><br><ul>
<li>I should be allowed to have the LHC at all. (To quote from my previous post: </li>
</ul><br><p>If the LHC was impossible to build because of a stray cosmic ray strike, <em>then</em> the cosmic ray strike would still be the world's single greatest existential risk. Having the LHC is not the only existential risk; there are other things like nuclear war or engineered pandemics which might seem less plausible but are much more catastrophic and hard to predict.)</p><br><ul>
<li>I must be allowed to finish my calculations, and to write down how many LHC disasters there would have been to prevent if the plans were wrong, so I can put a <em>decision</em> value on the final outcome. (To quote again:</li>
</ul><br><p>If "collider disaster" occurs, then the only thing that matters is the value that goes into the decision node, not the precise final configuration of stars in galaxies. I have computed this value. The outcome could even be dominated by the value of humanity's future potential, if not by the direct result of the disaster itself\xe2\x80\x94as I have described several ways that this could go.</p><br><p>If the "collider catastrophe" doesn't happen, then (I think) the real-world result is dominated by the LHC project itself, which is extremely difficult to assess. But if we can find a way to minimize the other existential hazards I have listed, it would also probably have good effects on reducing the chances of "collider" accidents.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
