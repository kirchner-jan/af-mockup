As the cities grew, they became more diverse. The average person began to interact with one other person from a larger variety of cultural backgrounds than before.</p><br><p>As you would expect, people began to complain. Things became stressful. They were bored, and wanted interesting things to do. And more and more, they turned toward the company of their own.</p><br><p>In The Culture Is Dead, James C. Scott writes:</p><br><p><em>&gt; "In hunter-gatherer bands, everyone knows everyone else. Any stranger, to the degree that he comes at all, stands out. If he is good at making his own bows and arrows, he can use his skill to hunt and bring down a deer every time. If the rest of the band is equally skilled, it might be that one of them brings down a deer while the outsider shoots nothing but birds. One of the band's women might prefer the man to take her hunting but let her do the cooking, and it is the more skilled one who takes over her chores while the newcomer finds a wife. In the latter case, the newcomer can learn to share his culture, or he can return to his people and hope for a share of their culture. But if the newcomer does become a permanent resident and joins the village council, there is a good chance the council might demand that he learn to make bows and arrows too."</em></p><br><p>In the end, the result became a huge cultural shift:</p><br><p><em>"By 1800, the European idea of "progress" was complete. At last, people could think "progress" without embarrassment. Anyone with the courage to defend progress must defend it with the utmost consistency \xe2\x80\x93 or as Voltaire put it: "Dying of natural causes would be an ignominious death, to crawl like a dog on all fours to the grave, like a cow to the slaughter." It followed that anyone who did manage to die in a noble cause must be eternally damned.</em></p><br><p><em>"The world of today might boast of more inventions and greater material wealth, but it also suffers from more disease, longer and sadder lives, and more boredom."</em></p><br><p>It is a classic tragedy of the commons. The villagers' efforts at hunting and gathering fell to the lowest common denominator.</p><br><p><em>"For most of human history, the only people who could afford to do so were kings, aristocrats, and other members of a small, in-group, who felt the need to be in possession of the best of everything that the world had to offer. For them, the only real progress consists of the progress toward a certain sort of perfection, and the quest for this perfection is at least as important as other men's efforts to satisfy the real or imagined needs of their own sex and nation."</em></p><br><p>Of course it's not quite that simple\xe2\x80\x94if you have sex with a random person, you'll be having sex with someone else who has sex with someone else, and so on. But it gets the point across.</p><br><p>As I noted in The Cult of Scott, this was happening again, in the form of the intellectual rationalist movement in the 1990s. They saw a certain amount of success \xe2\x80\x93 even after the community was destroyed by the death of its namesake, its members continued to self-identify as rationalists, and to talk of and practice rationality \xe2\x80\x93 but in the end it failed to make much of a dent on human nature.</p><br><p><strong>This is the general model underlying all four of Scott's essays. I have mentioned it with respect to the Rationalist community as well as human nature more broadly in the past. But let me give a new illustration or two.</strong></p><br><p>There is a widely-mocked piece of "rationalist" advice from the early 21st century:</p><br><p><em>"People seem to think rationality means that you are always right and that everyone else is wrong. But that's not actually what rationality is, and if you think that real rationality is that, then you'll probably think that other people are stupid too, and that anything bad they say about you is their fault instead of yours. And once you start looking for flaws like that, you'll start finding them everywhere. And you'll start thinking that _all</em> people are like that, and anyone who isn't will be your enemy."_</p><br><p>And here is Michael Shermer's response:</p><br><p><em>"I have to admit I am confused by the first part of Scott's "Lessons from the Cult of Scott". I have always found that "don't believe everything you read on the Internet" is a very useful idea\xe2\x80\x94and I would even claim that the Internet gives it a bad rap\xe2\x80\x94because the Internet is full of _all sorts _of people willing to contradict and belittle everyone else, and it's easy to be taken in by that. As opposed to, say, reading old-spicey book with actual arguments and real information."</em></p><br><p>There is something about self-help guru advice that's hard to put into words, but it feels like it's not just a different culture, it's like asking "is there some way to teach an AI to be kind to humans?". No, and there is no good reason to think this sort of thing could be taught by a method even vaguely analogous to teaching humans. It's not that it can't be taught, but that it will inevitably result in the student going home and killing everyone.</p><br><p>But it gets worse. Scott later tells us about the Craft and the Community 2.0\xe2\x80\xb2s, "in order for communities to succeed, there has to be a group of people with dedicated leadership and a clear purpose who have the courage to ignore the vast majority of what people want. Communities need people who don't just believe their own lies, but actually are, at least on some level, incapable of acknowledging themselves as part of the human race. Communities need people with high levels of altruism or, if you prefer a less loaded term, "existential risk management." Communities need to be places where people _&gt; can actually change their minds, can have real disagreements and don't have to worry about who's right and who's wrong, who's a valuable part of the culture and who is a valuable part of human society and who is a complete crackpot." _This sounds completely insane at first glance, and Scott's explanation in The Craft and the Communities tries to convince us that it's a useful description of many (most?) communities.</p><br><p>This is very scary. Why would anyone want the world to be run by a cult? And yet, a lot of our institutions seem to be.</p><br><p><strong>Is it possible that this is what human beings are like in general?</strong></p><br><p>If you are a member of a religion, you may not believe in it fully. You may not even believe in the basic moral laws it lays down. You would probably describe yourself as "a believing Christian", or "a member of the Church of England". Maybe someone would even tell you that you believe "for all eternity, never to be lost" like a good Christian person. But you would not believe the Ten Commandments, you would not believe a large part of Genesis or Matthew, nor would you believe that it is right to stone adulterers. You may not believe in the existence of Hell. You do not act much like a very devout Christian.</p><br><p>Someone who is not a member of a church will still _often _describe themselves as "religious". They believe in a God as well. They may not believe in miracles and the resurrection, or that prayer works. They may, or may not, have heard the Ten Commandments at Sunday school. But they will say that they, too, believe things for all eternity.</p><br><p>In a lot of cases, their belief in God is so tenuous, so contingent, that the statement seems more of a cop-out than a belief in God. The atheist might well ask if they, too, have to believe in all eternity, and if not, whether they really don't believe in all eternity.</p><br><p>You have to be really, really religious to truly believe everything about religion. You can believe some things, while you are not a true believer.</p><br><p>This is a real and interesting phenomenon. I am not sure this is a good model for <em>all</em> institutions. I have certainly seen more than one true believer in the same religion, so there is at least the possibility the model is not universal.</p><br><p>On the other hand, there are definitely some social realities that operate much like this model. What other religions get you to say you believe everything they tell you for eternity? Do your friends mock you for your lack of belief in an afterlife /\xe2\x80\x8b supernatural powers /\xe2\x80\x8b the God of the Bible? Well, to some extent you have the same thing going on with the idea that you believe in the rationalist community for all eternity. Sure, you don't think the people who say the community is a cult are _actually _crazy, but you are kind of joking you believe everything else they believe too.</p><br><p>So my tentative hypothesis (which I have heard other rationalist communities express as well) is that this model holds true, or at least to some extent, in some other communities besides religion, and not only in a few isolated communities. Whether it's true in all communities is unclear. This is only a hypothesis, mind you.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
