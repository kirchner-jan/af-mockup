<li><em>What changed between the evolution of human intelligence in the last several thousand years, and the recent invention of effective brain imaging and its rapid adoption in the research community?</em></li>
</ul><br><p>I suspect the main answer goes something like this:</p><br><p><em>To understand an intellectual topic as thoroughly and quickly as, say, the early scientists did, one needed better tools. In the case of human evolution, good tools would have required the development of modern genetics, physical anthropology, fossil recognition, etc. To understand a complex topic in which the key variables are not obvious, and which involves a massive amount of complicated math and statistics, as well as many thousands of observations, one needed new techniques. In the case on human evolution, those tools didn't exist until fairly recently (especially the tools for tracking genetic markers); they were available for the first time in the last 10,000 years or so. They didn't work for several generations after that, and it was only after the scientific discoveries of the 1940s and '50s that they began to be used consistently and effectively.</em></p><br><p>And I agree with that explanation in a broad sense, but it sure strikes me as an extraordinarily uncharitable view of how human intelligence developed over time. Here's an alternative hypothesis:</p><br><p><em>The human brain underwent a qualitative transition (to a new algorithm) at some point between, say, 10,000 BC and 1500 AD. All the earlier versions were worse at _most</em> everything. In particular, they were worse than chimpanzees at self-awareness, empathy, abstract thinking, creativity, and abstract problem-solving. The new algorithm didn't evolve until humans were on the brink of the Industrial Revolution. The old algorithms were retained even if they performed worse than they did in childhood. And so, it took a while before these things really improved._</p><br><p>And that is how I think human intellectual progress works today, too:</p><br><p><em>We had some _very</em> important innovations in the last few thousand years that gave us enough tools to understand new domains much better. These advances included formal logic, mathematics, the scientific method, the printing press, democracy, and the Reformation._</p><br><p>Why did the old intelligence algorithms do so poorly on <em>so many</em> tasks? For the last several thousand millennia, there was never enough time or other resources available to investigate that question rigorously. It sure beats my alternative hypothesis though!</p><br><p>Here, though, my guess is that the answer to that question would have been substantially different just 10,000 years ago.</p><br><p>[__Edit: __It's been pointed out to me that this question is pretty much answered by Pinker's <em>The Blank Slate</em>; see his discussion of "Anthropological Fallacies" and "The Myth of the Blank Slate."]</p><br><p>In my case, I'd like to extend this to:</p><br><p><em>Why did it take so much time until it became possible to build a reliable AI?</em></p><br><p>An important sub-issue here might be: What was the state of AI research around 2000, when the first <em>reliable</em> AI was built? How is a researcher today supposed to know whether she's in a world where AI progress will be slow or fast?</p><br><p>I've been told that around 2000 there was actually <em>some</em> serious AI research happening, but it was all "narrow AI." In other words, you can imagine that AI researchers were trying to build computers that could type faster, or understand the user better, or do better scientific experiments with computers. <em>But they weren't really trying to build computers which could learn to do anything else.</em></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
