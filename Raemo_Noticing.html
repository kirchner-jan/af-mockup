<li><strong>Be prepared to notice and reflect</strong></li>
</ul><br><p>Over the past year I've found Noticing useful for dealing with akrasia, anxiety, depression, and just having good social skills.</p><br><p>Before, I'd say "I'll do it later", and then never end up actually doing it. Now, I'm a lot more likely to <em>actually do it</em> without stressing myself out in the moment.</p><br><p>The trick is to have it <em>reactively</em> trigger a thought. The first step is to have your trigger action in mind. What do you do when you notice yourself <em>noticing</em>? This is often a good trigger.</p><br><p>Trigger Action Planning</p><br><p>The first step is for my trigger action to be a trigger I feel excited to notice. I also want a vague sense of being a bit confused. A lot of times if I notice this, I often want to go <em>into _a vague thought, but sometimes if I notice that I think about the thought instead, it helps me to just accept that I _am</em> confused. And if I can't resolve the confusion, at least I'll know I do it. (I know some people that find doing some of this activity actually useful!)</p><br><p>An example trigger... "I'm thinking about feeling a little bit bored. If I notice I'm aware of my sense of being bored, I can just follow that by noting my confused sense of, 'but I didn't feel bored!'"</p><br><p>Some triggers might look something like "... and this makes me feel like... this is a <em>really important skill to practice and internalize?"</em>, and then it starts to give me a bit more information to play around with.  (If I feel like "oh, well, maybe doing <em>some</em> noticing might be useful. But if I'm just thinking about this now, it's useful to reflect upon what's going on first."</p><br><p>Noticing is a <em>complex _pattern of activation. Sometimes I find it helpful to do some additional action immediately after the initial trigger, which might be "do some further research". My _second _action might be something like, try to notice my brain _not yet</em> doing any of the following.</p><br><ul>
<li>Thinking about how to get the project done in the next week</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Thinking about the thing I wanted to do _this _week</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Thinking about what things I need to do <em>this week</em>, including things I _haven't _yet done.</li>
</ul><br><p>I call the former "next actions", and the later "this week actions" for "this week". But when practicing Noticing, I'm <em>not</em> always explicitly thinking about next actions. Noticing could still <em>feel _like a failure if for whatever reason, I end up failing to _notice</em> next actions and this week actions for weeks on end. If that happened I'd want to be a bit more careful and think "what exactly caused this to happen in the first place?".</p><br><p>Sometimes I'll think of next actions and this weeks both after the initial noticing trigger, but other times I'll do only the this week action. Sometimes I'll alternate between thinking about future actions, and the past week in particular. I think it's useful to explicitly hold some concept of being reminded to think about next actions and how my next week <em>in particular</em> is going.</p><br><p>So my final trigger action might look something like "<em>any time I notice myself feeling frustrated about having to do something I haven't yet done, and I don't have a next action I'm excited about, I think to myself, "hmm, this seems to be the right time to practice __this week's action__"</em></p><br><p>Once you have a trigger, the next step is having a plan for when the <em>next _trigger triggers. I find that a lot of times, I only need to do it on one or two occasions, and then can get a vague sense of it starting to help me to eventually trigger on it _and start doing regular Noticing</em>. So I think it's mostly useful to do at least one or two of these, and then see if I need to periodically refresh my "noticing reflex" with more or broader stimuli.</p><br><p>The last action is a simple trigger, "<em>when I notice this trigger, I </em>[whatever action]<em>". Maybe I'm going to do a walkthrough of the task on the spreadsheet, and I _still haven't really done the task yet</em>, so I just walk through the task for a minute or so. Other times I find it helps to have some particular object in mind, and just think to myself, "<em>When I think of [X, Y, Z]</em> I'll go and do it"_.</p><br><p>You can adapt the trigger and trigger action plan to find whatever works best for you.</p><br><p>How to do Noticing</p><br><p>I'll use this post to give a step by step walkthrough of noticing, with examples throughout.</p><br><p><em>[note: This walkthrough is largely informed by the way I use Noticing, and differs in detail from the way others do this.</em></p><br><p><em>If you do not currently use Noticing at all, I recommend you start by reading the "How to do Notifying Right Away" section]</em></p><br><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> A thought, emotion, sensory perception, or feeling "tickles" that I want to notice.</p><br><p>__Action: __Sometimes, I'll just think to myself something like "<em>hey, I'm not sure why I'm feeling frustrated. Why don't I go check with [friend/\xe2\x80\x8bcoworker/\xe2\x80\x8bmy-parent]?"</em> and this can often give a valuable answer quickly. Sometimes I can't generate a useful action to <em>start</em> with, but when I actually go to check in with someone who's known for being particularly good at helping me figure out "hey, my brain is yelling at me for some reason I don't know what is, can I ask someone for help?"</p><br><p><strong>Action:</strong> Sometimes I find that I need to do some work up front and in advance. Like, work out what my next action for Noticing would be and do it when I notice I'm not sure what my next action would be. (I don't think you ever actually <em>should</em> wait until you notice something to start doing something, but sometimes you do and it's useful to be prepared for that if you can.)</p><br><p>__Action:___ When I'm sitting down and want to make some progress on a task, often at this point, it's useful for me to do a quick scan through my mind: [I might think to myself, <em>"I'm feeling a bit frustrated. Is there a different task I could do that wouldn't feel as much like a burden?"</em>, or I might stop and do a quick check in by thinking <em>"hey, am I feeling frustrated because I've already spent an hour on this? Have I done something different yet that I could try that might feel way less like that?"</em>]</p><br><p>Maybe I don't even have a good question <em>to _ask about [other task] right now, but it's often worth taking a couple of seconds to really consciously _notice</em> that I might have gone into "automatic mode" and started working on this while not fully aware of what led me there. </p><br><p>Maybe I've talked to [coworker 1] about the project last week, and I do expect to <em>still _see progress on it sometime next week, and it seems fine to check in on it whenever I have time. Or maybe I'm planning on taking a week to just read [read-and-rewrite a short story] instead, but I feel like there's something I should be getting done now so that I can get back to it by the end of the week. And maybe I can do that next week. Which is fine! But if I can do it _this</em> week, I might be able to make more progress.</p><br><p><strong>Action</strong>: Sometimes I can ask myself, "Hmm. What actually triggered me to do this? What am I actually hoping for? <em>[If something feels unimportant, just stop and try to come up with some next actions.]</em>" [If something seems like a burden, or like I don't care, try to set some next actions that would start me on track to feeling excited about it.]</p><br><p>__Action: ___I also find this triggers a curiosity. There's often some underlying <em>feeling of frustration</em>, and I wonder "is this a useful way to spend all day, or are there other things I could be doing for the same amount of effort?"</p><br><p>Sometimes it can be useful to stop and explicitly <em>think</em> about "Is this useful? <em>Would I be able to accomplish both my goal from last week, and then my next [goal]?"</em></p><br><p>Noticing often feels like noticing a failure. It can be useful to _accept _that feeling, and then move forward anyway. It's a useful check in to ask myself "is this actually useful?".</p><br><p>__Action: <em>When I notice that I feel frustrated and _could</em> be doing something else, <em>[try to set next actions that are the right time to do something about what's going on in my life.]</em></p><br><p><strong>Trigger Action Planning</strong></p><br><p>Trigger: When I notice I'm confused about what's going <em>on</em> in my life.</p><br><p>Action:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
