if your security measures only work if you can prove the obviousness of the problem, that makes sense for security, but that's going to be a pretty terrible way of writing software anyway."</p><br><p>In terms of security, the security problem of having an agent which is able to tell you anything about the agent is called a <strong>security threat</strong> and it is quite clearly a problem which needs to be solved somehow. The obvious problem is that any such threat would be unneccessary, as the agent could just claim to be stupid and stupid agents would just say whatever you wanted them to say.</p><br><p>I'm talking about some kind of automated security testing, maybe just running a web app or a compiled program, and seeing what gets printed out by the shell, or the debuggers, during execution. Maybe it's the input that the human looks at as they try to enter a password.</p><br><p>The security threat is the obvious problem not because we know that it's an obvious problem, but because if we didn't know that was a problem then someone might build an agent which could simply claim to the human that it's in fact a stupid agent and say whatever it wants because the stupid agent would never have tried to trick the human.</p><br><p>Let's generalize this thinking a bit. Imagine that I write an agent which can predict other agents. Maybe it's a simple predictor, but I think that any simple predictor is dangerous. I have to do something else, which I call a <strong>security measure</strong>, or something to limit what the predictor can say.</p><br><p>If I decide to do something trivial instead of creating another predictor, which is my <strong>obvious solution</strong>. Then I need to explain why that solution wouldn't work if the predictor is smarter than I am.</p><br><p>I'm using the term "obvious solution", in this context, because the security measure obviously solves the problem I'm trying to solve. It obviously solves the problem because I know that this will not lead to other forms of security threats from the predictor.</p><br><p>I can think of different kinds of security measures, even. Like, maybe this agent might end up taking control of the agent that's actually executing the predictor so I would like to use some kind of security measure to stop that from happening. Or maybe I would like to make it so that my agent could always just give the human false security about its intelligence, or at least prevent it from reading the source code.</p><br><p>To clarify my terminology, I'm not talking about obvious "security flaws" that the agent can still hack around or any other forms of security measure. I am talking about the actual security measure which would force my agent's intelligence to be less than that which is allowed by the security measure.</p><br><p>The security measure I'm using is probably not even the most secure way to solve the original problem, if there are any. It might be, but if I'm using a security measure at all I'm probably using something better. Hopefully the other "better" security measures that I don't know about will help me solve the original problem.</p><br><p>(My apologies to anyone who knows a better term for this than "obvious solution".)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
