<p>It is widely believed that universities should invest in hiring based on their research productivity. In the past, the most popular way of comparing universities has been to measure their performance in producing highly-cited researchers. A more informative way to measure performance is to examine the fraction of researchers each university claims. We find that, at least in hard sciences, universities with relatively few highly-cited scientists tend to recruit larger fractions of researchers than do universities with relatively many highly-cited scientist. We find further that universities with a greater proportion of highly-cited professors tend to recruit a smaller fraction of researchers. Finally, we find that when adjusting for the number of faculty, higher quality of researchers generally predicts a higher recruitment fraction.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>As a group, scientists spend a great deal of their time writing on the internet. The more that students write in a field, the less likely they are to get a job. This isn't fair; the more talented students you have, the more likely you are to get hired on your first try  (i.e. because employers want talent). The problem is that writing online has a self-reinforcing quality. More people who write online and get jobs will write more, which feeds back into the self-reinforced community of people who write online. Thus, the people who write the most are almost guaranteed to find jobs, and since there is so much competition and little room, only a small percentage of people will make it into a prestigious university system (say 30%. We can think of this community as a kind of "blogosphere".</p><br><p>What does this have to do with hiring?</p><br><p>How do we determine the <em>payoff</em> to the university for hiring a particular research assistant? Consider just a few simple models:</p><br><ul>
<li>Model 1: The professor can choose the degree of hiring on a one person basis. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Model 2: When an assistant arrives at the university, the professor decides what grade of hiring (e.g. 0, 1, 2a, 2b) they would like their assistant to get.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Model 3: The university chooses a <em>decision tree</em> that indicates whether that grade of hiring is sufficient or if more research needs to take place (e.g., for Model 3b, the decision tree must indicate that an additional year is needed before a hiring decision will be made (see the footnote for more detail on Models 2 and 3).</li>
</ul><br><p>Model 1 and Model 2 both produce the same number of hiring decisions to every individual. Model 1 is superior to Model 2 because it allows each researcher to select his or her own research assistant. Model 2 on the other hand, can only hire the top 1\xe2\x81\x843 or 1\xe2\x81\x844 of hiring-capable research assistants. Model 2 also produces a greater number of hiring decisions than Model 1 and thus has more prestige among potential hiring managers. Model 3 is better than Model 2 for the obvious reason that a decision tree helps the professor make hiring decisions. Model 3 is inferior to Model 1 and Model 2 because it doesn't give researchers the option of hiring the very top research assistants out of their pool of potential candidates.  </p><br><p>The first research assistant you hire is probably worth more to you than all the others you decide not to hire, because it's likely that a large fraction of the potential candidates with your research interests would get hired if you just did your research through them instead. For example, suppose that the quality of research assistant A is a factor of 1 when hiring assistant A1, and a factor of 2 when hiring assistant A2. That is to say, if assistant A1 is hired, the professor would be hiring assistant A1 <em>twice</em> as often as assistant A2, and if assistant A2 is hired, the assistant A2 would be hired twice as much as assistant A1. Thus, the expected benefit of hiring a research assistant <em>given that he or she is hired</em> is twice as great for using Model 1 or Model 2 instead of Model 3. Model 3 on the other hand produces an average benefit of hiring the researcher that is no better than hiring the average of all the potential researchers. As an example, suppose that there are twenty researchers who are candidates for a research assistant, that the quality of each assistant is a factor of 2, that each assistant will be hired for an expected profit of $0.50, and that the university only has $100 of available funding to distribute between all the available researchers. As we can see, Model 3 (the decision tree) makes a bad choice. The better choice, as we should expect, is Model 1 or Model 3a \xe2\x80\x93 Model 3 is essentially the same as Model 1 but with two less hires, whereas Model 1 produces four hires and Model 3 produces two hires. That is to explain why a university will more likely advertise that it has a faculty of $100,000,000 if it has a fractional faculty of $500,000, and that they will hire more researchers as a result of this advertising. </p><br><p>What can universities do as universities to improve the hiring rate for their science departments?</p><br><p>The most practical way that universities can lower the likelihood that their students will fail their PhD is to increase the quality of students that enter the PhD program. </p><br><p>One factor that negatively influences how well you know if your researcher is talented is how many publications the researcher has in the field, even though both amount of publications and researcher quality are well correlated. If you increase the quality of the researchers by lowering entry standards, you will decrease the number of new publications in your field of expertise, which is correlated with how much your students are likely to fail their PhD. A second factor that negatively affects your knowledge of a potential researcher's talent level is how much he or he is willing to communicate with you and respond to your emails. We can call this his/\xe2\x80\x8bher "eagerness" to publish. A third factor in your estimation is how much the researcher has had success in obtaining grants. Again, the more successful a researcher, the higher the chances that he or she won't be available to work with you. Finally, to get a more accurate idea of how talented a researcher really is, you will do a job search. But this job search will not generate many interesting hits if the researcher is not eager to work with you and if he or she is not good (i.e., has great publications to his/\xe2\x80\x8bher name, a low eagerness to work with you, a high number of outgoing emails, and many more like statements like "I don't take requests"). I hope that this last point is not surprising to some readers, but you will still read it because it makes a good case for more job searches. The more interesting a researcher is, the more likely he is to be good at the job of solving problems, and the more interesting the job he is trying to solve, the better he will be at solving it:</p><br><br><p>Of course, the most interesting way to evaluate your potential researchers will be to do a job search, and because jobs are becoming harder and harder to find for researchers, you can't go to a job bank to ask candidates to teach you how to find a job, but you can go on the world wide web and look at how many publications those candidates have made in the past. The less a potential job seeker has published, the less likely he is to get hired as a professor. Thus, if a candidate has made 300 publications in the past, you may want to give him a fair chance. If he has only started working in his field a few years ago, you might want to be a bit more cautious. So far, this process of evaluating talent is really quite complex and has not been standardized; there are many websites that list faculty for hire and offer help in researching faculty. </p><br><p>You might also consider increasing the number of jobs that science majors can get in science related fields, such as teaching positions, industry positions, and research positions. These jobs could be easily filled if you lowered the entry qualifications, for example by accepting some lower quality students, or by increasing the starting salary.</p><br><p>You have other options that you might try. You could start to invest money into hiring, like hiring a top-notch tutor to be your researcher's personal development tutor to help teach him how to learn effectively. You could try hiring a personal coach to help teach your researcher how to motivate himself to work hard. You could give your researcher a desk at your office where he or she can stay after college hours and write papers. This is not so much a solution to the problem but the university administration could do more of it all the time. </p><br><p>So, do you fund your university's hiring process or not?  (I have the feeling that there are many more donors who think that they should fund their hiring processes but not those of other universities...)</p><br><p>And now, here is my most controversial question. Since the number of research staff in your university should also influence the fraction of your science students you actually get to hire as an instructor, you may want your university to spend more money hiring faculty of high quality.  (Remember that you only hire the most talented of your students.) </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
