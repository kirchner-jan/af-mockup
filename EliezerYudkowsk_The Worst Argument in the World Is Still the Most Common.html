I think it's a good story\xe2\x80\x94it's one where you can learn important lessons, and where I can personally testify that it happened to me on two other occasions as well. So I won't spoil the narrative.</p><br><p>Let's just say that someone is having a heated argument, and that the person they're arguing with insists that there is no such thing as rationality. After a while they realize that they can't win their argument against the other party\xe2\x80\x94their argument is not strong enough to break through to them. It doesn't matter what clever arguments they can think up in favor of their case; the other person is never going to accept them. They are <em>not</em> rationalists.</p><br><p>So they start to despair. Now they don't believe it's possible to persuade others of anything. This is the stage known as "the Socratic Dilemma." One either does not believe it is <em>possible</em> to persuade others to a belief; or even worse, one can't find any belief that they <em>do</em> believe in, on which other people can be persuaded with arguments.</p><br><p>The other party is getting very frustrated. They want the arguer to change their mind, and all the arguer can do is say "No, please, it's futile to argue with me, my arguments are not persuasive!"</p><br><p>Now this is a <em>particularly</em> frustrating situation\xe2\x80\x94at this stage all else is futile, so you may as well talk about anything else rather than trying to start an argument.</p><br><p>The first thing the other party tends to say in response is:</p><br><p>"So why don't you come over to my side, and then we can <em>both</em> convince the other person."</p><br><p>So the arguer sees that if they abandon their belief in the importance of arguments and try to win out in an argument, they will indeed be able to convince the other person. It's just that, because they've <em>already</em> abandoned the possibility of winning out in an argument through argument, the other will be able to argue quite effectively that it's futile to <em>try</em>.</p><br><p>But the Socratic dialogue will go on until either one side changes their mind, or when someone gets fed up and exits the dialogue. You can think of this as the person arguing both sides of their dilemma and then exiting once the dilemma stops being useful.</p><br><p>For the vast majority of human debate, there exists no convincing, rational reason for supporting one side or the other: the only choices are "You said so" and "The other guy said so."  Or occasionally "You'd pay $X for a product that costs $1.50, and you would prefer to pay $0.75 or $0.5."</p><br><p>Arguing about the correct definition of rationality will not change this until you're both smart enough to understand how to debate, and wise enough to realize that arguing about the correct definition does not really change a <em>single</em> <em>damned</em> fact about the world.</p><br><p>It sometimes occurs to the other side that someone else they believe to be a rationalist will actually concede that his own side is <em>correct,</em> for some inexplicable reason. They may try to argue this point as part of the dialogue, but they'll usually discover that it ends in a dead end.</p><br><p>When an argument actually ends up being about definitions, you can still see why debate doesn't work. If I argue that I am a rationalist of a certain type, and someone else disputes that definition, you shouldn't expect each of us to change our minds about the truth of the matter. I already <em>know</em> the truth of the question\xe2\x80\x94whether I'm a rationalist of that type or not\xe2\x80\x94and so any point I could possibly make about the definitions of that type of rationality would either be more or less irrelevant; that is what's true.</p><br><p>So by now the other side probably realizes that they've been talking to a wall, but they feel that they've exhausted all the other options: they know that even trying to persuade me will not work, and that I'll <em>refuse</em> to change my mind until it gets to a question where I can win. Well the other argument has also gone by now, so they decide to try a different route\xe2\x80\x94one that I won't be expecting of course. They say, very quietly:</p><br><p>"The other guy is just <em>wrong.</em>"</p><br><p>I don't think it actually occurs to me that this is any sort of rational argument. <em>I</em> can't prove I am not a rationalist because it's self-defeating to suppose that I could. Only a rationalist could <em>refuse</em> a rational argument to support their rationality! If you're a rationalist who claims that no rational argument exists to support their own side, then <em>you can't be rational</em>! If you're really <em>so</em> smart, why don't <em>you</em> change your mind?</p><br><p>Well, there are several things you could say. You could say that, actually, you <em>are</em> a rationalist, and of the type I'm talking about in particular\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even a superrationalist. But I could easily reply that I don't believe in the existence of higher-order rationality, so all arguments about my being a rationalist of this type are moot\xe2\x80\x94right? Oh, hang on a second, there's still a question of my being a rational superintelligence, and a rational transhuman one at that. I am a real rationalist already, who cares?</p><br><p>If I were to use any clever argument that I could think of, it would be in my interest to appear to you as one of the types of rationalist who would recognize a truth of the general flavor of "If you are a rationalist, then there exists a truth in the form of such-and-such."  It's not a <em>strong</em> clever argument, if I tell it to you to establish my rationality. It won't have enough force to persuade you! What are you, some sort of superintelligence? What does it mean for you to be rational?</p><br><p>But now you notice that, while I might be persuaded that there exists a truth of the form "If you are such-and-so type of rationalist, then the proposition 'There exists a rational argument from your proposition P to your conclusion Q' is true".  Well, <em>now</em> there's an argument! I am a rational being! Do I believe that? Do I believe that <em>you</em> believe, or indeed that I myself believe my own belief? But it also sounds like the kind of "rationalization" or self-deception that an AI might engage in. That's <em>ridiculous.</em></p><br><p>A smart opponent might even say:  "<em>If</em> I accept your conclusion Q, then there exists the proposition you believe to be a reason, namely (P\xe2\x86\x92Q)."  But I am a rational agent! Do <em>I</em> believe that? Of course I believe that! If I believe P, and you believe (P\xe2\x86\x92Q), <em>then</em> do I believe (P\xe2\x86\x92(P\xe2\x86\x92Q))? Am I going insane?</p><br><p>But it is now your turn to come up with a clever argument. I'm already too smart for you, right? And too rational. So instead\xe2\x80\x94</p><br><p>"The only possible state of reality is the one you believe, therefore you are not a rational agent."</p><br><p>That's <em>not</em> the kind of clever argument I'm used to hearing from intelligent people.</p><br><p>Suppose I'd never heard of the self-referential paradox, and simply believed that my opponent was as smart as I am\xe2\x80\x94that is, that <em>if</em> I believed something then that thing must be true. Suppose I'd never realized what it meant to say or even believe that there existed a rational argument from my conclusion to my premise.</p><br><p>Well then, I would, in that case, <em>not</em> be quite so quick in accepting a "There exists a reason" argument as a defeater for myself. It could be that there is some truth of the form of P\xe2\x86\x92(P\xe2\x86\x92(P&lt;-&gt;Q)) or P\xe2\x86\x92(((P&lt;-&gt;)Q&lt;-&gt;P)), and I didn't realize that because I simply did not <em>know</em> that the conjunction "P-&gt;(P-&gt;(P&lt;-&gt;q)) and P-&gt;(P=&gt;(P&lt;-&gt;P))" would imply "P-&gt;(Q)" so easily as I did in the case of "P-&gt;(q)", due to my knowledge of the existence of clever arguments. I would think on it for a while, then realize the <em>pig</em> in my <em>hat</em>, but then not feel the rush of self-confidence that I'd normally experience when I realized I was rational. So perhaps I would <em>defer</em> to someone with superior <em>references.</em></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
