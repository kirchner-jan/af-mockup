This is true for the purposes of identifying talented people. Unfortunately, this is far from how IQ tests are used.</p><br><p>People who take IQ tests are far more likely to find that a test-takers IQ is below 100 than above 800. The median IQ for test subjects who answer at least one question correctly is around 150.</p><br><p>Similarly, when researchers <em>take into account</em> that people who answer more questions correctly are more likely to have lower IQs, the effect goes the other way. Here are some of the standard IQ tests. Most measure things like working memory, processing speed, or abstract reasoning, though of course any of these could also measure general intelligence:</p><br><p>I don't know where these numbers came from for the exact tests above, but the general trend is fairly clear: tests typically identify very intelligent test-takers.</p><br><p>And if we control for IQ, the differences tend to be even larger. A Princeton study compared the performance of college students without ADHD and students with ADHD on tests.</p><br><p>If we look at the top 20% of the population, IQ tests tend to identify the top 1%-2%. Of course, this could just be a coincidence. Maybe the tests just happen to target certain skills more than others.</p><br><p>In any case, the results are roughly what you'd expect from someone who works in cognitive psychology.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>If you aren't aware of it, cognitive psychology is actually an extremely useful and respectable sort of field. Some big names are associated with it: Amos Tversky, the psychologist who invented the conjunction fallacy, is pretty famous, but he's not the only famous one. Daniel Kahneman is also pretty famous. His studies of biases in judgments of risk have been cited over 500 times, including by the US House of Representatives. Jonathan Baron, one of his colleagues, is a professor at the University of Washington, and has studied human errors on cognitive tasks for over a decade.</p><br><p>I have no personal experience in the field. It seemed to me that someone who spends their life studying humans would want to know as much about human nature as possible, so I'm going to ignore all this and stick to the field of computer science. Let's look at one of Kahneman's famous studies, which is a real eye-opener:</p><br><p>It's widely known that the conjunction fallacy (as well as a handful of similar fallacies that follow the same pattern) is caused by overconfidence in one's own abilities:</p><br><p>Here's how he tells it: let's say you want to learn how to play chess, but to learn how to learn chess, you have to learn how to distinguish good chess players from bad chess players. Suppose you're going to pick six chess experts to study with, chosen according to the six different skills necessary to learn how to beat them: strategy, tactical skill, physical skill, stamina, concentration, and communication. In case it wasn't clear, the authors of the study are claiming that we only need to study <em>one</em> of these skills, rather than <em>all six</em>. They argue the evidence they've cited proves this.</p><br><p>In other words, it is very common for psychologists to study the conjunction fallacy. If you look at some of the studies that cite the conjunction fallacy study as evidence for one type of bias or the other, you quickly run into a wall formed by studies that found the opposite in slightly different contexts. These studies might give different results, but in any case they are not all the same. So when psychologists try to analyze the conjunction fallacy, they have to do some serious post hoc rationalization, at which point they are very likely to go from "There's plenty of evidence for the conjunction fallacy" to "We found this specific conjunction fallacy to be the only irrational one!" without ever pausing to think that the two things don't really look that similar.</p><br><p>Take a moment to read the linked studies yourself \xe2\x80\x93 I find them kind of disturbing.</p><br><p>Here's also a little more info on those studies. They have pretty much the form of experiments we'd expect, and the results are not entirely crazy. These studies are very often cited in support of the conjunction fallacy, and the authors themselves are often quite convinced of the truth of this view \xe2\x80\x93 at least when you study the literature, they seem to. At the time the original conjunction fallacy study was published in 1983, Kahneman was a junior author on the paper.</p><br><p>For the record, I did not read the linked studies, since they're written in mathematical notation that makes no sense to me. But if you're interested in reading them, they're all available online for free for anyone to read.</p><br><p><strong>III.</strong></p><br><p>In 2008, psychologist Keith E. Holyoak posted an article on the front page of <em>The Huffington Post</em> and received a flood of critical responses. In it, he wrote about a new study by his colleague at Cambridge University David R. Hogarth on overconfidence:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>It seems our overconfidence has now been replicated over and over again\xe2\x80\x94and our level of understanding seems to be at an all-time low. This means that many of us are more overconfident than chimpanzees and the New York Yankees.1</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I have not read the study in question, which is unfortunate for my own credibility as a human being. The fact that my colleague is so overconfident in his overconfidence is also not reassuring.</p><br><p>At any rate, a New York Times reporter writes a big story about the study. The reporter is so convinced that this is true and important that they use the headline "Overconfidence Is In Our Nature." The article explains the study with the title overconfidence is in our nature:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>But an experiment published today in the journal Science suggests that we can learn to "catch ourselves in the act of overestimating our abilities."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>...</p><br><p>Overconfidence has long been known to plague experts. Psychologists study the "overrationalist" for more than a decade, and they've repeatedly confirmed that those people are just as likely to be mistaken as those who are under-confident. But new studies have shown that the bias is not as stubborn as it seems...</p><br><p>...</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
