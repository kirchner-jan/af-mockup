I want to talk just at one particular aspect today, the rise of academic women.</p><br><p>From his post at some level, men and women are equal:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>A lot of evolutionary psychology tries to prove that men are more interested in sex than women; maybe it's "hardwired".  For myself, I've got one "hardwired" thing I'd like to know:  Why aren't <em>women</em> more interested in power than men?</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Eliezer's speculations can be categorized as either evolutionary hypotheses or sociological ones. Evolutionary hypotheses explain why men and women tend to prefer different things, usually in different environments. Sociological theories explain why women have historically been discriminated against or seen as stupid, and why men generally don't see women as "people" the same way. Eliezer's post makes me think the latter theory is just about right and the former theory fits in with that.</p><br><p>Elieziers speculations on both evolutionary theories and sociological ones, and I want to focus on the evolutionary because I don't think I understand his evolutionary speculations at enough detail.</p><br><p>Elites aren't primarily concerned about reproductive competition</p><br><p>The two biggest criticisms Eliezer has leveled against evolution-based explanations are that evolution doesn't have an explicit utility function and that it isn't an agent, so it can't be optimizing for anything.</p><br><p>I still think evolution has an explicit utility function in the sense that genes don't care about how well a trait's bearer reproduces any more than atoms care about how big they are. They're atoms care about atoms. That there's some kind of reproductive selection pressure at all is just implicit.</p><br><p>I also think that evolution is an extremely agent-like system</p><br><p>Elite opinion tends to be pretty strongly driven by the elites themselves, and also a lot of that opinion is self-serving. Elite opinion might not even be conscious of all the ways that elites' actions optimize for themselves (though some of it probably is); that elite opinion itself might not even have explicit beliefs, instead making use of its own cached beliefs about the world.</p><br><p>I've said before that I don't feel like evolutionary psychology is trying to justify the status quo, but rather to describe what the status quo is like. Elite opinion and thought tend to be mostly male, while female opinions are frequently filtered out by the heuristics that generate elite opinion in men.</p><br><p>Elite opinion has an enormous amount of influence over the rest of society, and elites are mostly people. Because of this, I want to look at elite opinion and ask the same questions I ask of the general population. Why don't young women in elite academia have the same opinions about the world as their male peers? What causes them to have some opinions and not others?</p><br><p>I already discussed some answers in my post on gendered STEM majors, but let's go back to the question: why do I see lots of posts in the tech sector and STEM spaces about women's issues, but not in the general humanities or social sciences or the hard sciences like biology or physics?</p><br><p>One obvious answer is class: if you have lots of the same set of people, then you have a higher degree of homogeneity than if you have very different classes of people. That's a big part of why social scientists' opinions of themselves and each other tend to be about the same as your opinion of yourself and most of your friends, even if you disagree with most people on almost any subject.</p><br><p>I'm a social psychologist, and I'm pretty good at noticing differences in the culture I live in (e.g. New York City vs. Texas).  However, when I look around, there aren't any obvious differences between the cultures in Silicon Valley and the Berkeley STEM communities. Why does it matter that I was in Bostrom's class in undergrad and not in MIRI's?</p><br><p>I think part of the answer is that elites are more focused on what they're doing than the people around them, not just about the current task they're doing, but more generally about all of the tasks they're involved in at any particular moment. Elite opinion therefore has a big focus on what they are doing and their place within their org(ies).</p><br><p>I think it's important to remember that it's possible to be a lot of things at once</p><br><p>Here's an example of someone from a less-than-top-tier elite college being very involved in STEM and computer science and science fiction, while still being a person. I know of a woman in her twenties here who is very active in both the rationalist and Effective Altruism communities and has her own blog and group on Tumblr. (I want to give her and all of my friends credit for showing up to things while they still have their 20s, but not them for staying involved after their 25s.)</p><br><p>Here's another example of someone from the opposite end of the spectrum:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>[I]f someone can't understand a given topic (for example, evolution) or a given idea (for example, atheism) then this means at least some high percentage of his population is <strong>failing to achieve a general level of rationality</strong>.  I suspect that is, in some cases, the <strong>dominant</strong> position of many people on the web who I've encountered.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I think there are many people with high skill in one particular thing who are still able to talk intelligently about pretty much anything at all.</p><br><p>Maybe these people have lower opinions of themselves? Probably not. More likely, they're just very involved in lots of different things in a way that gives them a view from a broader perspective and makes their opinions about themselves and everyone else more coherent.</p><br><p>My speculation, then, would be that people whose lives are pretty closely tied to, or involve themselves in, academia have opinions not much more coherent than the average person's opinions about themselves and others, but they have the advantage of a more structured sense for their place in society and being able to focus on one thing at a time, which explains the gender imbalance in STEM, and allows them to put more thought into a particular issue.</p><br><p>Or, more speculatively, I think the reason people don't have coherent opinions about themselves is that people in academia have little say in who and what they work with (so there are no easy filters for who counts as good company and who doesn't), but their opinions on everything else are strongly determined by who they work with.</p><br><p>In a way, there are two systems at play, both of them related to our society's obsession with status:</p><br><ul>
<li>Academic work is one of the primary ways that people get status, but it often has little direct payoff beyond a small number off prestigious publication credits. You get to work with people in academia, be published by them, etc..</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Being "successful" in academia is one of the easiest ways to get lots of external attention, which can then be leveraged into status. I'm not trying to make a claim about whether this is "better" (I think it's likely there are things it's hard to do well which people value more than things it's easy to do well which are more valuable, or something like that) but it is definitely about status.</li>
</ul><br><p>Both of these systems are imperfect and have unintended consequences. I think there is a much bigger gap between elite opinion and normal opinion than we might think at first.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
