Before this became the focus of a podcast, he was the author of The Myth of Unborn Emancipation: "In the age of Google, we are more interested than ever in the past, not due to our wish to understand history for its own sake, but because of what it teaches us about the present. If it doesn't show us that people have not in some way changed since the Middle Ages, that they are only just now becoming fully enfranchised, then this becomes a major argument against our progressive politics and our progressive religion." (pp. xiii-xiv)</p><br><p>In this interview Harris explains:</p><br><p>The Book of Mormon has a great deal going for it. First, it's really, really long. Second, it's the Old Testament of Mormonism. Third, the Book of Mormon claims to be a revelation from on high, which means that it contains things that, if they were true, would be really important. Now, there's a lot of things that would be very embarrassing to our modern-day churches if they realized that they were true. But I think that people have this really comforting illusion that, <em>I'm going to read a lot of the Book of Mormon, and I'm going to read more than is sensible to be reading.</em> (p. 9)</p><br><p>I am a Mormon, and I think of Harris as my Mormon uncle, the one you don't really ask about religion at Thanksgiving and so you learn the answer only when it's too late. Like most Mormon relatives, he also has opinions about religion and politics that most people would regard as weird. And not always in the wrong way.</p><br><p>I have the same feeling about The Book of Mormon\xe2\x80\x94that at some point I'm going to hear (and I have already heard the book a number of times) that the Book of Mormon actually predicts the Book of Abraham, and that the Book of Prophets, with its promise of golden plates, corresponds to the Book of Exodus, and when I finally do learn that this claim is true, it will be too late.</p><br><p>That it is long (Harris notes that reading the entire Book of Mormon took him five years, or one every five months) can be a good thing. For example, because the Book of Book is so long, the prophet Mormon decided to cut some of it out of the Book of Lehi on an expedited basis. So long as any of the original text was available, everything else wouldn't be necessary for the purposes of the faithful. In theory.</p><br><p>On the other hand, a five-year reading of the Book of Book would hardly have helped him understand "who the Book of Mormon is. It's not about Joseph Smith... The Book of Mormon is about the Book of Israel... A lot of these things make sense if you think that Joseph Smith... was just a figurehead (literally). There's a lot of the same argument from authority..." (p. 16) </p><br><p>This is not really an answer. Is The Book of Mormon an authoritative book? No. Is it about God and his power to reveal himself? No. Is there somewhere in there a passage that I should consider to be a key part of God's revelation?</p><br><p>Well no. I would be pretty unlikely to stumble on such a key passage. As a Mormon, you won't stumble, because you will have seen that Joseph Smith was simply a figurehead and it's just a coincidence that the book mentions his name. </p><br><p>And even if one did stumble upon such a passage, it's clear that the passage wouldn't be part of the revelation to the Americas, which are thousands of years older than the Americas. Why does the book talk about "the Americas" rather than "this America" or "the country currently called the United States of America"? (p. 15) </p><br><p>Harris isn't wrong that Mormons tend to downplay Joseph Smith's role during and after the Book of Mormon's translation. Indeed, the standard view within Mormonism is that Joseph Smith is the author, and the Book of Mormon itself is his second-hand record of conversations with the ancient book of Israel. Joseph Smith is the prophet figurehead, and the Book represents his faithful record of what he and the Lord Jesus Christ had together (for example, Jesus asked Joseph whether all of the plates and the engravings were real, and Joseph explained that if Jesus had asked any differently, the Lord would have told Joseph that it was wrong). As such there is no need to worry that you'll be told anything like: "the Book tells us that Joseph was just a figure-head and it's a coincidence that it mentions his name". </p><br><p>Even if you did stumble on such a passage, would it mean that Joseph Smith was a prophet who could only reveal things that had been told to him by the Lord? It wouldn't be clear why it was necessary to stumble on such information, since the Book of Mormon explicitly identifies Joseph as a prophet or messenger:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The text of The Book of Mormon has survived in a near-full form for 2,500 years, whereas the Book of Israel was translated from plates only 150 years after it was dictated in 1830. So how would Joseph have access to the plates and the other items that had been described in the Book of Israel? (p. 27)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>It's worth addressing this question directly here, because it informs our understanding of what Harris says about The Book of Book itself. As Harris says:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The Book of Book is an authentic ancient record from the Middle East... it gives direct, plausible, verifiable physical accounts of battles fought in ancient America... the Book tells us things that Joseph Smith could verify as a historical fact (he could look at the plates, the brass plates, the [golden] plates, the seer stone, and many other objects). (p. 49)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>So is that all he's saying? No. At that very moment he goes on to point out not just that The Book of Book may have been created before he and the other witnesses interviewed (it was first translated in 1830) but also that the Book of Book never mentions Joseph Smith as anything other than a scribe who kept a written record of what he heard.</p><br><p>At that point we realize that it is possible that this book's scribe had some kind of vision, or that Joseph Smith may have transcribed (not dictated) it while he was in a delirium. And that even if he were delirious, it's at least possible that Joseph Smith himself, in a vision of the Book of Egypt, saw an ancestor of his whom he would recognize as an Israelite named Jacob, and that he heard Joseph Smith dictate these lines to a scribe who then created The Book of Mormon. </p><br><p>Finally, although Joseph and his contemporaries didn't find their own visions to be plausible enough to publish or teach within the Church of their day, they are just our perspective. It's even possible that in the future, someone will decide to see this version of The Book of Book (which, as far as I can tell, describes only the first part of a translation of at least a much larger book translated from other plates) as evidence that Joseph Smith was in fact the author of The Book of Israel and that the first portion of the Book of Israel and his translation of it could be found in The Book of Book.</p><br><p>The Book of Book is not a prophecy. It's a scribe's record of an ancient record that may or may not have existed. </p><br><p>What else was revealed? Well, the name, given by The Book of Book to its scribe, is "Ether 12," but the Book of Book mentions other things, like the fact that the scribe had the vision of an Israelite named Joseph, and the fact that he made the scribe's record a seer stone held in his scribe's hand. (p. 14) </p><br><p>Harris even goes so far as to compare the situation with Joseph Smith to that of the scribe who wrote the Old Testament in response to Moses in Egypt and the Israelite scribes who collected the Old Testament from Moses. Both of these men would end up writing documents that seem much more likely to be the product of a delirium and hallucination than the revelation of Jehovah.</p><br><p>As such, by far the most charitable thing one could conclude about The Book of Israel is:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>It might not have been a scribe's copy\xe2\x80\x94it might have been Joseph Smith dictating while in a mental or physical state much like that of his scribe during a vision. But it's probably not the source, because for this to be considered a revelation it would have to be a prophetic vision, and any information discovered in the writing would not have been in the plates, since it must have come from the Book of Israel. (p. 35)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This is, however, not what Harris says in his book. He goes on to argue:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Even if Joseph Smith was indeed the author of the plates... There is no evidence that the plates were dictated to him by the angel Moroni (the ancient narrator in Joseph Smith's view)... For Joseph Smith to explain away his own internal revelation (which he says took place in a vision) in terms of "another witness" is a dodge. (p. 66)</p>
