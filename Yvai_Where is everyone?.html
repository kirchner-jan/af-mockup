This led to the question: why?</p><br><p>In the original survey proposal on the mailing list, there was the following comment:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I think it's great that we're asking about that, but it's a very low priority and we may get lost in all the other questions.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>But if we're doing the survey because we want to know what demographics people have in our community, where are they coming from? I was able to find some answers.   Some people are in other countries and <em>never left</em>, so the question is moot.  </p><br><p>Some people are in the US, but live elsewhere. How do we know? I can think of two ways: by asking them where they're from, and by their answers in the relevant questions other than the one above. And the later is what this thread is about.</p><br><p>This is a thread for Less Wrongers who live in a foreign country, or who have ever lived in one or wanted to. It is meant to get those answers, and give them an answer they can actually understand. To do so, you need to answer at least three of the following questions (and one bonus question). Please only contribute if you understand what they mean (or can translate them to a more appropriate form). Do not be shy\xe2\x80\x94you're welcome to answer if your country is the only one in the word and you know everyone else in your country lives in your country.</p><br><p>__EDIT: __The rules are posted at the top of the thread (in addition to all my usual comments).  </p><br><p>The three questions are (with explanations):</p><br><ul>
<li>How did you end up in your country of interest?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is your favorite season (winter, summer, fall, spring)?  </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What region (North, South, West, East?) do you live in?   </li>
</ul><br><p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> It came out that the third question is also asked in the Less Wrong census/\xe2\x80\x8bsurvey (if you don't know how/\xe2\x80\x8bwhy, this explains it).  The fourth question is an extra bonus question\xe2\x80\x94if you don't want to put something in the bonus section, I really mean that bonus question to be an extra question because if someone has no idea what area their country is located in (but it's in the Less Wrong community anyway), then that person should definitely try to answer the bonus question instead, since one of the reasons that question is in the bonus section is to find the most common answer.  In other words, if anyone actually has no idea why they're in their country, then by all means leave them the bonus question.  </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
