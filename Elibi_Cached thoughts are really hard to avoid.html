</ul><br><p>Cognitive science suggests that memory\xe2\x80\x94including memory of thoughts\xe2\x80\x94is fragile, malleable, and short-term rather than absolute. When you think of a friend you never see, it's not that they _don't _exist anymore but rather that they're not accessible at the moment you are looking for them.(1)</p><br><p>So if you think of a thought, does it exist in your head? If not, how do you know you did? What happened to your head when you thought of that memory? Did they store it, or were you imagining it? Would it really be _meant _to exist?</p><br><p>One can see this from the inside too. For example, suppose I am walking down a busy street. If I am hungry, I am likely to stop to eat\xe2\x80\x94it's _very important _for my personal survival, after all! Why haven't I thought of it, when I usually have those thoughts? Did that thought exist in my head?</p><br><p>The point of this post is that <em>this</em> is the reason people have hard, painful thoughts\xe2\x80\x94because they're trying desperately to make sure that thought exists in their heads, and for them it's failing.</p><br><p><strong>"There is another step I'm missing. It wouldn't be fair to assume I am trying in particular to avoid painful thoughts."</strong></p><br><p>(A different reply on the Facebook thread and by others was that you would be giving up something useful for the sake of avoiding pain, and that's not what people do.)</p><br><p>And in fact, people <em>do</em> do everything they can to make sure they avoid painful thoughts. This seems obvious, if you have done the things I recommend. But if you don't, you might not realise what happens to your mind when you try to avoid having thoughts.</p><br><p>The following is the result that I got from trying to avoid painful thoughts, by trying not to have them. It does not describe _all _kinds of pain avoidance behaviors. There is a lot of variety, and it all varies a lot by individual case, but I hope that by knowing the common patterns I've been pointing directly at. The common points I think are pretty important! </p><br><p>The mind is weird</p><br><p>It's very tempting to <em>try</em> to have no painful thoughts, but it doesn't work because the brain is <em>very</em> weird, and is <em>not</em> going to stop you from wanting to think painlessly about things.</p><br><p>To illustrate this, let's take two common cases of this.</p><br><p>A. I want to write a novel. I want a story inside my head. It feels good, important to me. If I stop myself from wanting to think that, what's going to stop me from wanting to <em>live</em> inside that story? I don't actually want to live in that world!</p><br><p>B. I have bad memories of being yelled at as a kid. It's painful, but I would never want to suppress the feeling of needing to ask my dad about something. It would be a loss of information. (Or, I think about that painful memory. It's _trying _to come into memory. It's not, but it still wants to try. And it's so powerful that the memory sometimes pops up into consciousness without the context, instead of waiting to be asked about it. It's important at all levels. I don't want to lose it. But I also don't want to suppress my emotional attachment to it.)</p><br><p>So if I want to give myself more freedom to <em>not</em> be in a certain reference class of thoughts, what can I do?</p><br><p>Cached thoughts as "hard" thought</p><br><p>The reason I tried hard to avoid painful thoughts was because my brain cached them as <em>hard</em> thoughts, things you <em>do not want</em> to think.</p><br><p><strong>Now, <em>maybe _for (A), it's helpful to suppress unwanted strong feelings, but I have a sneaking suspicion that for any _finite</em> number of thoughts, there is a stronger one that will come _before _them.</strong> Maybe you can't stop feeling your pain, but _maybe _you can stop being distracted by _any _possible sense of how to stop feeling your pain. </p><br><p>__Similarly for (B). __My brain has cached that <em>any _painful thought is _hard</em>, so when I want to avoid a particular one, my brain notices and flags that as something that might be hard to avoid. And then I go "ugh, I don't want it to be hard so I'll make it a hard thought" and so it <em>feels</em> like it is being hard to avoid.</p><br><p>This is all a hypothesis I have right now.</p><br><p>But if it's right, it's important. Suppose you <em>really _want _hard</em> thoughts to be able to come to consciousness on their own terms, but this comes <em>somewhere in the first minute</em> or something after the thought, but it doesn' t feel like you've <em>gotten</em> the point that the particular thought's time is coming. This would be a key cognitive bias that could lead to huge cost, eg by letting someone else get mad at you. And you'd _think _you're doing it deliberately when you're _not-_doing it on purpose, because of the cached thought of hard things being hard.</p><br><p>Similarly, it _feels _like my life is terrible if I _don't _imagine that I can live _somewhere _where my feelings are welcome to come to consciousness and not be suppressed.</p><br><p>So this means you have to be extra <strong>careful</strong> when you're doing any thought suppression. You need to know how long it takes. And if you have an urge to do this thought suppression, you need to do <em>something _to tell yourself that you're not just going to take pain for the sake of it. And then you need to either do the thought suppression and do it at that time. Or to come up with a _different</em> thing to do instead, before that initial desire to suppress or ignore the thought. Or perhaps you might need to come up with another way to keep the painful thoughts from coming into _this _world.</p><br><p>How to make sure you need all of that, is not the point of this post. The point of this post was to demonstrate clearly that <strong>the problem is with the mind, and not the brain</strong>, that it's not fixed when you have thoughts about pain. If you believe you need to suppress unwanted thoughts, it's not necessarily <em>because _they're _suppressed</em>. If a <em>thought _is considered pain or not, that's a product of how it comes up, and where it comes up in the rest of the mind, not necessarily whether you'd really still feel like having that thought if you _did</em> feel that way.</p><br><p>(1) It may not be <em>that _hard to keep memories of things you've never _felt _that you'd want to forget, but if you ask it specifically, they may come immediately\xe2\x80\x94implying that your brain is not so much making it easier to forget, as just _doing what it already could be doing.</em></p><br><p><strong>Added: __I have found that the difference between wanting <em>hard _mental states vs. __wanting any state at all</em></strong> _is whether I have a general sense of needing to have it all be in my conscious mind, or whether I sense having it anywhere at all (even if I feel like I "have" it). </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
