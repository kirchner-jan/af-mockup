And you say, "You can't call wanting people to do things horribly oppressive."And then you say, "If you think the government is going to do those things to you, you're a libertarian. If you don't think they should do those things to anyone, you're a conservative. You just don't care enough about your fellow man, and you can't be a consequentialist after all."And after you get it on the table they both say "But you should still defend everyone from tyranny!"So you think a bit and say "Okay, let's try this at a different angle. Why do people think everyone wants to make others do horrible things?"</p><br><p>I can think of two reasons. First: the fear of punishment. They are a consequentialist; if you don't help your fellow man, then by their reasoning, they'll hurt you.So they think they'll be hurt by someone doing something to the poor? And they won't take it from the hands of someone who did it to them? They won't let a rich person do it? Then the rich person ought to go and help the poor man.</p><br><p>Second: the fear of abandonment. If you are a social altruist\xe2\x80\x94if you believe everyone is your equal, and therefore if two people are having trouble one of them owes the other something\xe2\x80\x94then if you don't make them take care of you, they'll be a burden on them.So they think, "The poor man is struggling, and the rich don't look after him, so he does not deserve the help of the rich. He did not want to work hard enough and therefore deserves to starve."</p><br><p>And in fact the latter is the correct logical conclusion, given the correct rules of thumb and the correct emotional responses. This is what most people mean by the Malthusiansphere and why they believe that a rich person helping the poor man is "selfish".</p><br><p>The correct solution to the problem, of course, is the other way around. You are allowed to help the poor man, and the poor man is not allowed to take advantage of your generosity. The rich man is not your equal. But this is a pretty radical conclusion, even compared to the typical leftist position.</p><br><p>Imagine a society where the standard economic theory is correct: The rich are very strong, the middle class are average people getting by, and the poor aren't getting anywhere in life.The standard view of the wealthy is that they are lazy. That the rich don't work hard enough for their wealth. That the rich are selfish and want to keep everything for themselves.This sounds pretty reasonable if you're the type of person who believes everyone should be the same. So it would be pretty surprising to learn that the wealthy are instead helping the poor who lack resources. You might even think we should make it a law that the wealthy should help the poor.And who would argue against that? But then who would argue against the next step? The next step is even more surprising to a consequentialist.So the wealthy should help those in need. In doing so, they are making themselves part of society. They should help share the tax burden with everyone else.In returning to this society, you might say, "What you're not saying is that the wealthy deserve to have to work a little harder just for the privilege of receiving a lot of resources without working at all."Now the wealthy would say, "How dare you accuse us of laziness!" We have worked as hard as we could and have earned our wealth by hard work. We should not be forced to share it from the bottomless pit of the poor so that the lazy get to sit around all day and never do anything but live off the charity of others.The poor would also say, "You're a hypocrite, complaining about a thing you're doing. You haven't exactly been the picture of wealth yourself."And the wealthy would say "But you're wrong, we really do have more resources than many of the poor. We've probably got more resources than half the people in this country. The poor man can't work hard and get ahead. It's his fault and we deserve what we get, but you don't get to complain about it, it's on your own."But then the poor would say "Yes you can. You just don' need to help the poor in particular. Any poor person can take advantage of your charity and so this doesn't favor the rich over the poor. You don't need to help us in particular."And the wealthy will say, "But we're allowed to. If the poor man is working and doing his best\xe2\x80\x94"But if you keep demanding that we give more money than we take, you're going to create huge numbers of worthless jobs and we're not going to give to you anymore. You can't be a liberal and also believe in work."</p><br><p>They'll say it would be so nice if everyone were as rich as them, and in fact they'd probably be right. But if that's so nice, why can't they just not be selfish?Why can't they be so liberal as to make the poor man take care of himself?And the poor will say "But you don't help any less than if you were doing something else you don't like. We can't eat or sleep or find a job if other people aren't spending their money on us. Don't you like helping the poor? Well then, do what you want, and make everyone else do it as well. You don't care enough to even take care of yourself how can you expect to help others?"</p><br><p>Now, you might think, the Malthus-consequence argument doesn't actually work as stated here.But it illustrates a larger principle. If you think all men should be equal, that means if two people are struggling and one of them is rich and strong, then the rich person ought rightfully to help the poor person out.They shouldn't be a billionaire while the poor person is barely able to survive.The rich person doesn't work hard enough to be able to take care of themselves, and if they did work hard that would still mean we owed it to the poor person to help them do it.But we don't think all men should have equal resources. We don't believe the wealthy have to be the same as the poor.So why would poor people be allowed to claim equality with the wealthy? Isn't that the very definition of slavery?And why would you allow the wealthy to claim equality with your lower class?Isn't that the very essence of class inequality and oppression?Why would you have the state help the wealthy when there's so many poor people to help?But if you want to be a liberal the rich people shouldn't have to do anything for the poor.</p><br><p>Here's another way to look at the problem:</p><br><p>Suppose the wealthy people say, "There's so many poor and they work so hard for their living, but they still can't afford food or rent. I'm trying to help them."And then the poor people say, "How about those rich people who never work at all? They can have all the money they want, without working hard and being self-sufficient. You shouldn't expect us to struggle so hard while they just live off of the proceeds of our labor. They should just work hard and pay a higher percentage of the taxes to help us?"But the wealthy say, "Hey, that's not fair to them! They earned all that money by working hard! You shouldn't expect them to work harder to help you, you should make them give everything back!"</p><br><p>Or maybe this one:</p><br><p>If you make people give up most of their income, then poor people will just live off of handouts and take advantage of the system. Rich people, on the other hand, will really help them as hard as they can.When the rich give, they won't just buy themselves nice things but instead will send most of their money to the poor people.And so from a consequentialist perspective, rich people who give their money to the disadvantaged would be more moral, and we need to tell them so so they have less to give.</p><br><p>Now don't stop there.
