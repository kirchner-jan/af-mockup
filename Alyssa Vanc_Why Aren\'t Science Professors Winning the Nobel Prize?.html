It seems to me that their work is more central to physics. But, physicists and chemists are both physicists and chemists, after all. It makes me think that we should look for patterns. What differentiates physicists and chemists? What does it mean when the same work is central to physics, but only peripherally to chemistry?</p><br><p>Here's another puzzle: physicists and chemists aren't the only physicists, and chemists and physicists aren't the only chemists; all kinds of people engage in their work. What differentiates scientists from layfolk, in the eyes of the public? I don't have a good answer, though I admit that it would be a hard one to gather data for. Is this because scientists are the smartest? Is it because they're the sort of person who will always have an interest in the study of things even when the interest isn't directly applicable to their careers? Is it because their work is abstract and hard to understand, and the public can't relate to that at all?</p><br><p>When I talked to some friends about this puzzle, they thought that I should be focusing on the winners, and not on the total number of winners. But, how many _Nobel Prizes _are there in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, etc.? Surely, you could win all those categories and never _win _a Nobel Prize.</p><br><p>So, those are two thoughts that occurred to me.</p><br><p>Now, I'm sure that many people (particularly commenters here, I think) will say that I have misunderstood the point of the essay, or that I'm making a straw man. That's fine.</p><br><p>But for the sake of posterity, here's my own take, in the hopes of hearing feedback:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Here's what I think might be going on:</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Physicists and chemists are _not _in direct competition, right? You can engage in either field, have a career, do research, publish papers, etc.</p><br><p>Physics and chemistry are both very mathematical, and therefore can be <em>very</em> different disciplines from one another, right? And physicists and chemists each make a very different set of discoveries that have very different implications. That's it, right? Is that the cause?</p><br><p>But, aren't physics and chemistry <em>both</em> fields that rely heavily on mathematics, and also have important practical applications? Aren't physicists and chemists <em>both</em> making discoveries that have interesting implications?</p><br><p>Maybe that explains things. (I find this point pretty compelling, anyway, as discussed in the comments here.)</p><br><p>I don't like it, though.</p><br><p>As a physicist, I think chemistry is a very important and beautiful field, and one that a lot of non-physicists are too ignorant of to appreciate. Many chemists are also good scientists in other respects, so it's not <em>necessarily</em> the case that chemists are poor scientists overall. Maybe there are other factors at work, that a lot of scientists here aren't aware of (though I doubt it).</p><br><p>In light of the fact that <em>chemists actually do make more important discoveries than physicists</em> I don't think science professors can be considered to be "under-acknowledged" for their work in physics. Maybe there's something in my mental model of physics and chemistry that I'm misunderstanding, but I think it's not that either of them get less respect for their work than do chemists and physicists respectively.</p><br><p>Again, none of this says much about the quality of their research, of course. Or even the importance of their work at all.</p><br><p>This post was written in response to a recent post on <em>LessWrong</em> that was making what struck me as a bit of a mockery of science as a whole, and as a way of getting under the author's skin. That post has provoked some interesting responses on LW, so I thought that the above might be of interest. So I published it.</p><br><p>(Note: this post might be confusing, or poorly structured, or something else. I am <em>not</em> saying it's well-written right now, but it's my best guess at a post that might be useful to the community.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
