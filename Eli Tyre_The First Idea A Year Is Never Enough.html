</ul><br><p>The first thing you should do when you notice an interesting idea is figure out whether it would be good to start following it up. Most ideas that I think are interesting enough to start gathering examples, fall into one of the following categories:</p><br><p>How you can start collecting <strong>examples</strong>:</p><br><ul>
<li>I had this idea for a post on Less Wrong, and so I decided to collect some examples of the sorts of things that fall into the category.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some sort of pattern in the way that people approach different types of problems. </li>
</ul><br><p>An example: </p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Category One:</strong> Ideas on how to study better, or how to learn generally. These might look like books, or videos, or exercises. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Category Two:</strong> An idea on how to think about stuff generally. </li>
</ul><br><p>Examples in Category One:</p><br><p>I think that the "A Mind For Numbers" is a good example of category two. It's a book about learning math better: it explains how to think about math problems, and then uses examples to explain that thought process. </p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Category Three:</strong> A cool idea that's so new that there aren't any examples. The idea is the thing to which you're trying to point your examples.</li>
</ul><br><p>Examples of category three:</p><br><ul>
<li>How to build a robot that can climb stairs. This was an idea that came to me on IRC. I knew of the robot vacuum, and I had never seen anyone talk about building one that could go up stairs, but when I saw that one it really made me think that it was possible. There were no books on this, or any other books about climbing stairs at the time; it's just the sort of thing that people think to themselves about if they're a bit more in touch with reality than average.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>__Category Four: __Some new thing that's kind of crazy: for example, "A machine to create a real-time synthetic video game interface". It's not the sort of thing you expect to see in a book, but when I came across the idea I had the right context to see it and start thinking about it.</li>
</ul><br><p>Examples in Class Four:</p><br><p>I've seen several examples of ideas in category four, and I plan to write about them before they become well-known. I'm hoping they'll fit enough into the framework of this post that readers who already heard about them will be able to take away something useful from it. </p><br><p>How you can <strong>build up category-three ideas into category-four ideas</strong>:</p><br><p>For example: </p><br><ul>
<li>If you have a bunch of thoughts about how you can study better, it might turn out that some of the things that you learn _can't even _be explained in terms of the abstract ideas of category three.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>For example, maybe there's some particular thought pattern that makes you want to learn calculus, and then you notice that calculus involves a bunch of math concepts, like integration and derivatives. You can see them as concrete, and they're good concrete examples to use when explaining all the abstract ideas that comprise calculus. Or, you can take it to the next level and argue that calculus is all about how the derivative is different from the rate of change in a particular situation.  In that case, it'd be nice to see lots of examples of people getting better at calculus by working on problems that look similar to problems in calculus textbooks. </li>
</ul><br><p>I think this has some relationship to the sort of "meta-improvement" that I talked about in this post, and the reason that I did that was to point out how you can use category one ideas as examples of category two ones.</p><br><p>Example:</p><br><p>I was trying to think of better ways to learn music theory, and it occurred to me that I probably knew some of the best books on how to learn violin, so I pulled out my violin and started reading a bunch of them, and then I noticed that it was easy to generalize from what I was reading in violin books to what I would do in music theory books.</p><br><p>The generalization could probably be used to improve the book recommendations that people make to each other. Noting that, I thought that it would be a little silly of me to dismiss the idea immediately. To the best of my ability to reconstruct what happened next, I spent at least two days agonizing over my options: </p><br><p>First: Try to write this idea down as a generalization.</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>I decided that the generalization would be that the best books on violin to teach someone would probably teach that person how to use good violin playing techniques.</p><br><ul>
<li>This generalization gives me category-three ideas: "The next thing to do is to build a bunch of violin practice tools and see which ones help me get better at violin"</li>
</ul><br><p>Second: Ignore the generalization, and look for examples of books that teach good violin playing techniques that fall into category one!</p><br><ul>
<li>\t</li>
</ul><br><p>The generalization is already a category-three idea, so I could use category one to get category-three advice on how to get better at violin:  "Try out your different violin practice tools, see which ones cause improvement". Maybe I <em>can</em> get some specific specific advice from it...</p><br><p>Third: Figure out what the generalization actually looks like. </p><br><p>It took at least two days to actually do, but I can't say that I did this by applying the gears-level-thinking-tools from the previous two paragraphs. But I <em>did</em> try applying these tools. </p><br><ul>
<li>I read books that taught me how to play violin.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I tried to imagine things that the books had failed me at, and then I tried to design a toy example that I could actually run through in my imagination, get advice on how to solve it, and then actually run some experiments.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I wrote out the generalization: </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"The books that teach you violin technique will probably also tell you that you have to practice and listen and learn different parts of the violin, and I was told some things about different things to play and listen to"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>This gave me category-three advice, and I then set to work designing and building toy examples to try and get advice on how I can actually apply that advice into real-life situations.</p><br><ul>
<li>Some of these toy examples turned out to be things I had run across in other books. Some of them turned out to be new things that had not yet been published!</li>
</ul><br><p>My advice for you:</p><br><p>In the same way that I learned how to use better tools for thinking about rationality, you can probably learn how to use better, more accurate tools for thinking about the arts. In my case, this generalization turned out to apply to a number of fields. You might benefit from trying different tools to think about different fields:</p><br><ul>
<li>You might learn to think about more fields, rather than thinking that there are just four fields. (In the example I gave, that meant instead focusing on four subfields of music theory.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you are trying to learn a new subject\xe2\x80\x94or trying to figure out a path to be on the cusp of trying\xe2\x80\x94you might be able to learn how to learn a new subfield better using the tools that you already know. (This can make learning calculus go much more smoothly.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The tools in this post might still be only the beginning of the set of the gears-level thinking-tools that will improve your ability to think about the future.</li>
