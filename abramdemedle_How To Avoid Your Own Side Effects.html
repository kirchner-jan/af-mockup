</ul><br><p>I've thought about this idea for awhile, and I think it's very important. When I first started thinking about it, I found myself not really having any ideas for how to describe it concisely, so I'm posting this here in hopes that somebody will help me craft a more fleshed out version of this idea. I consider this to be one of the most important ideas I've had to date, and it seems worthwhile to help others to get better at it. Please comment if you know of any good writing about how to notice and prevent a similar kind of failure.</p><br><p>The System</p><br><p>Let's say you're writing software (an algorithm for a problem solver, for example).</p><br><p>When you write software, you (usually) don't have access to the thing that's causing it to fail. Usually, you have access to the output of the system (a text message, or a list of files), but not to the source of the problem.</p><br><p>How could you notice a problem from its output, but not from its input?</p><br><p>First, you would have to be smart enough to see the problem. What would you consider to be a problem? It seems likely you would recognize a problem if you had experience with a different similar class of problems. Your general solution to all problems in category a would be to do X.</p><br><p>Let's assume our AI is of the following form:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>There's an input, and there's an output. There's a problem in the input, iff one of the following:</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The data type for the output isn't correct.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>When that happens, the problem is in the input.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>A problem I would expect our AI to have, by it's nature, would be in the input. I think it's relatively straightforward to see that. A problem in the output would be less clear, and harder to know what we want to do about it.</p><br><p>Let me rephrase my example:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>In this case, "a system of some kind" would be an AI: "a system which does X with respect to Y." We're discussing how to recognize problems in a system, and so "system X with respect to type Y with respect to some input" would be the sort of problem we would be most interested in.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Let "system X with input type Y with respect N" be a subroutine of the AI which tries to solve or avoid the problem. "X with respect to" means "with respect to what it can deduce it's supposed to do about any problems it finds."</p><br><p>A problem with X "with respect to" Y, is, roughly, a problem which comes up whenever X has an output of type Y for some input.</p><br><p>There are three conditions which would generally need to be met in order for X "with respect" to Y to give us a problem:</p><br><ul>
<li>"X with respect" means X will find it useful to have enough knowledge about the inputs and outputs:</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>X will need to know what type of Y it's supposed to be trying to solve or avoid. In the problem I described as an example above, that could mean Y is a data type that represents a problem in some format X can parse and can potentially find use for in subsequent processing.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>X will need a way of knowing that it is supposed to use a subroutine Y with input type Z, whenever it tries to apply Y.</li>
</ul><br><p>For example, we could imagine a language for mathematical notation, where you could describe problems and solutions by providing a language for you to refer to. The notation for subroutines that do the work could be built into the notation.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"With respect" means X can't know what Y is, until after trying to solve or find a solution for its problem.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>A sufficiently powerful AI would have the ability to deduce everything it might be supposed to do about the problem from the problem definition in some compact form. (e.g. "Find some way to do that.)</p><br><p>If the AI can deduce what it's supposed to know, then Y "with respect" N is just a case of our system Y running into the same problem our more general class of N does. In that case, X may be able to construct, or find and use a different system Z to solve Y. It isn't necessary that Z be in this list.</p><br><p>There may be some subroutines which we cannot even see. The AI may not realize we've given it a list of the things it's responsible for solving or avoiding. We can do better than that if we can understand Y as a collection of cases, or a series of subroutines, some which may take other instances of Y with respect as a result.</p><br><p>That's the key idea of this post: sometimes we can give a problem-solver a very long list of types of its output, and still, it ends up having a problem "with respect to some input Y within". Thus, we give the problem-solver an output type Y, and we might as well consider Y as a set of possible inputs.</p><br><p>A problem is "with respect to Y" if there exists some output of type Y which causes the problem. There may be several possible cases, each of them involving a different type of Y causing the problem. For example, if Y is a data-type, and we give the AI a list of all possible data-types (all strings, all sequences of decimal numbers, etc), including all built-ins, then it may want to include all built-ins in it's data-list, or even all built-ins which are instances of a specific "built-in" type like this or that. Or X might want to use each integer to some integer it has found.</p><br><p>If the AI finds all relevant built ins to it within Y, then X will be able to solve Y "with respect to itself". It may not need to run any of them, or even need to know they exist, except as a potential target.</p><br><p>Types of Systemic Failings</p><br><p>The list above is just one way of describing a problem. I don't recommend this; that's only a case where I haven't thought of anything better. For a solution, let's take the subcase where Y is already known and defined. So now we want to specify what a systemic failure would look like, in this case:</p><br><p>Here's a list of all sorts of possible such systemic failures, and their examples:</p><br><ul>
<li>A problem where something goes wrong "in the system's own code"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A problem where the output type is "type X with respect" [to some type Y]</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A problem with [some X with Y], where X and Y might be the same "thing" in different instantiations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A problem related to [some X with type Y], where Y might be "type X with argument or output X," with type X specified.</li>
</ul><br><p>It's easy to see that in these cases, we say "X with respect Y" means "X with respect of something." In some cases, we'll also want to give the output type a title Y (I'm including some title Y in the examples), so we would say "type Y with respect of type Y."</p><br><p>What To Do</p><br><p>What can we do to avoid these kinds of systemic problems?</p><br><ul>
<li>Make sure you're including all necessary built-ins in your data-list (and all instances of them within the data-type Y which may cause problems).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Make sure there is "some way" to find X to solve Y in some fashion (other than "find all X" and then implement one of them). As above, make sure X is able to find this thing ("find or construct or use other X."), rather than giving a list of all X.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Include a description of the input type Y in your input-specification, so that when you ask the system to "do X with argument or input Y," it can understand what you are asking. If it can't find a way to do so, then make a more specific request, asking it to "do X for the type Y which represents the problem it has found."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you're writing software, make sure X isn't a black box: make sure it knows exactly what input it's supposed to solve/\xe2\x80\x8bavoid.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Make sure your AI can recognize that the problem it finds might indicate a problem with some other AI, and ask for more information about it. Do this even if the problem it finds is for it itself \xe2\x80\x94 the problem with one AI trying to solve another might just as well be used by the first AI to find a better solution to the problem.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Try to specify things in a way that makes clear that X will need to find the problem in some fashion, or need to know about it in some fashion, even if it is unknown or unanticipated. This is one of the most critical steps: finding problems that might not have been previously discovered for the AI may be quite difficult.</li>
