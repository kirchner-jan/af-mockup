a psychedelic substance can help one explore new regions of mindspace by making their pre-existing neural patterns (called "intrinsic mode networks", or IKCs) more likely to connect to each other. In addition, psychedelic substances can also help one explore new neural connectomes by making IKCs (as well as neuronal groups) more flexible and prone to rewiring.</p><br><p>QRI's toolkit consists of several tools that aim to do the following: 
 - Enable the exploration of a large range of possible brain states.</p><br><ul>
<li>Provide a tool for empirically studying and categorizing them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Aid in the study of psychedelic phenomenology by providing an interactive, visual interface.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Improve introspection by mapping out large-scale systems.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Mapping the phenomenology (what one is experiencing) of various doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on normal-weighted users with QRI Toolkit: Visual Acuity</strong></p><br><p>A recent paper from QRI, "A Large-scale Analysis of the Hyperbolic Geometric Phase of Psychedelic Drug Effects", presents a visual acuity tool that uses the Qualia Formality Hypothesis (QFH) of consciousness, i.e. the view that consciousness has a unique formal representation, to investigate the phenomenology that results from administering DMT (25µg, 50µg, 100µg, 200 µg) and 5-MeO-DMT (150mg) on normal-sized users (see the paper for more information and references). </p><br><p>The method combines QRI's psychophysics suite, called Toolkit, in one intuitive visual interface that allows users to rapidly and accurately determine a large-scale description of one's visual response. The goal of the psychedelic visual acuity studies is to:</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Use psychedelic substances to explore new dimensions of the state-space of consciousness.</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Do this safely</strong>. For example, this tool aims to study both the effects of high doses as well as mild and sub-psychoactive doses. Such study will help us discover whether high doses of N,NG-DMT in particular have unique, and thus far under-studied, behavioral effects as compared to moderate and low doses. And so the toolkit can help us avoid the common confound of administering substances that increase visual acuity at the expense of the subjective quality of this acuity. In other words, by comparing the visual acuity resulting from administering two compounds that have different dose-response curves we can ensure that the effects discovered are not due to the differences between how intense they are.</li>
</ul><br><pre><code> ____ ____ ____

<li><strong>Study the effects of psychedelics on visual acuity.</strong> For example, by studying the effects on visual acuity of DMT, it could help us learn that this compound affects visual information processing in qualitatively new ways.</li>
</ul><br><p>-  Study the effects of psychedelically altered brains on visual information processing. </p><br><p>The tool is divided into several sections: Calibration, CFF curve, Luminance contrast sensitivity function and Quantifying Bliss (QBB). Here, we just present a summary and discussion of what it seems like to use the tool for a N,N-DMETHYLTRYPTAMINE (DMT) high dose administration.</p><br><p>Visual Acuity</p><br><p>The user takes the Visual Acuity Toolkit for a high-dose DMT trip and the following input:</p><br><ul>
<li>The first question asks to determine how big of a text box one wants to use for describing their field of vision. The default option of 20x20 is fine.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>To answer the initial question: one must click and hold on the image of a text box for 20 seconds while also focusing on a point on the visual field of the text box. This step automatically takes the user to a calibration section, where one needs to calibrate the user's visual acuity, i.e., they need to determine what would be represented by the text box if the text box were full-sized.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The next step is to click on an image showing a text box. This image is 20x40 pixels and contains 40 text boxes of increasing size between 1 square centimeter and 12 square millimeters. By default, the option of 4x4 text box is chosen.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Now that the text boxes are open-sized, one needs to click and hold the text boxes for 10 seconds while also concentrating on a point.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>For each choice, the toolkit presents the user with a slider that allows them to adjust this text size (represented by the text box image) to compensate (or not) for the change of distance.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>All text boxes shown on the scale are also filled with the visual field of a person who is standing 60 meters away from the user.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>For better control, after this initial calibration, one can use the zoom-in function to adjust the size of the text boxes.</li>
</ul><br><p>The visual acuity that one gets in this section depends on one's visual acuity before experiencing the DMT. In this case, the visual acuity of a 60-meter viewer with 20⁄20 vision from the QRI toolkit (the user takes it shortly before experiencing the Dmt trip) is around 19.8 cm; after taking DMT, the scale ranges between 15 cm and 100 cm according to the amount and concentration of the DMT administered. For the highest doses, the scale ranges from 25 cm to 175 cm (on the DMT trip, and for the highest doses of 5-MeO DMT, the range is from 1 cm to 5 cm). The results of this section are not corrected for the effect of visual acuity on the perception of text sizes. For more details about the experimental setup, refer to QRI's Toolkit visual acuity study. In future versions of the tool, it is planned to display the results of this initial calibration with the text boxes adjusted for their size, and in this way a direct comparison between experienced visual acuity before and after DMT intake could also be achieved.</p><br><p>Luminance Calibration </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
