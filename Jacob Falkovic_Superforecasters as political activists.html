They have political and social opinions. They discuss those opinions on facebook. And they're pretty sure about them.</p><br><p>So if superforecasters have anything else wrong with them, it's that they aren't as <em>politically engaged</em> as some of us. Some of us are actually quite politically engaged, and there is a direct path between superforecasting and activism, or at least discussion of issues and personalities.</p><br><p>I'm going to be a bit more direct than I usually am on the internet\xe2\x80\x94because I feel like it should be common knowledge.</p><br><p>Superforecasting and social media</p><br><p>I use Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, WhatsApp, all the big superforecasting platforms to follow the news, and to learn about people whose name I've never heard of. They provide me with some of the most interesting and intelligent people on facebook, and in some cases even more so than twitter. It also gives me a good sense of how well someone is thinking.</p><br><p>It's been pretty much a decade without me being interested in any active politics, but it's still possible to find the good stuff out there. I'm an occasional lurker on Twitter, but rarely an out-of-the-loop one; usually the best people are there to keep the conversation going. And the best political ideas on twitter can often be found on reddit, and sometimes even old fashioned forums.</p><br><p>Meanwhile in political, political circles, I'm in conversation with a fairly large number of well-informed rationalists who tend to be left-leaning and a bit "cute". A few come from a Silicon Valley background, but this is rare. In conversation with more politically engaged people, most of it is pretty normal, to the point where I'm starting to think that politics itself is normal. I guess that's how it goes sometimes.</p><br><p>But there are a few, maybe a dozen of us, who really are interested in active politics, and think that superforecasting is a tool for changing the world.</p><br><p>It can be hard to find more information about the most politically active rationalists than on twitter, so I decided to start my own blog, with the implicit aim of giving more political information an audience. I've had some ideas of where to put it, and how to organize it, and am going to test some of those ideas on the internet. I can't promise to post everyday or even every week, but I did promise to post at least every other week, and I'll make that promise.</p><br><p>The first idea I tested, the "How to Be Happy" guide, is already over 50 pages long, and I think it's possible it could be split into parts and published independently as a book. I'm also thinking of writing a second one, with advice on how to do activism. The two will be connected, of course, in that if someone is looking for ideas on how to be happy, they'll also be looking for suggestions on what to do when bored or in need of a good excuse for a bad behavior.</p><br><p>Superforecallers seem more than capable of writing guides on being happy, but politics is more complicated and perhaps not as fun a topic as that. Some people find social activism much more satisfying than a random walk through their city. But I think superforecasters are in a position where they can help other people decide. More than any other group. They have the resources to back up their personal advice, and to give people the resources they need.</p><br><p>I already posted the above links to the "How To Be Happy" and the politics post, so if you want to check out the ideas I mentioned before, here's the rest of it:</p><br><p><em>How to Be Happy</em></p><br><p><em>How A Guide In Happiness</em></p><br><p><em>Is the West Racist?</em></p><br><p>_Misha Yagudin Is Right _</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
