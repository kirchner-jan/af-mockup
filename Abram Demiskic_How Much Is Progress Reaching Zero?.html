It's a nice exercise for those of us curious about how many alien civilizations there are and whether they exist at all.</p><br><p>But the Fermi Paradox gives me no information about the likelihood that there are intelligent life forms at all in the Universe.</p><br><p>A couple of years back a paper (PDF here) came out by Carl Sagan and Fermi pointing out that we have little reason to believe that life is unique in the Universe's history. For a civilisation to arise in one place, given that life is common, it follows that there should exist hundreds of thousands, if not millions of other planets where life could arise. Yet so far we have only found life on our own planet.</p><br><p>One might take this as a reason to believe that the development of life is not common. But Carl Sagan pointed out that this also leaves open the question of where life arose on Earth. In spite of appearances, the Earth is not the only planet where life could arise on. So there remains the question of how that life arose in the first place. For that matter, in that our life did not arise until Earth was ready for them, does it follow that there are other planets in which life could have arisen that didn't?</p><br><p>A couple more years back I put this into a blog post which I posted on my blog but nobody liked. I still stand by it, but there may be something a little deeper going on here. It is a puzzle that is both interesting and difficult to think about.</p><br><p>The Drake equation, which I mentioned in a recent post, is a tool to estimate a probability for the development of life in the Universe. The Drake equation is an extension of the Fermian question, and it does an excellent job of dealing with the issue of how advanced life might behave on an alien planet rather than being stuck to having to consider just the local situation of our planet. It says nothing about how alien life might act, but still allows to take it into account.</p><br><p>Given the fact that there are no clues (yet?) about how life actually arose, it makes sense to try to use it to get at least a rough probability estimate for where it's likely that life forms might exist \xe2\x80\x93 which is the basis for the question which the Drake equation answers \xe2\x80\x93 and then update our model based on the answer given by the Drake equation to the Fermi question which is how common life may be in the Universe. It seems to me that we really don't have any clues yet about the Fermi problem, and getting them is one of the most important research priorities.</p><br><p>It is a simple question in terms of questions asked, so why hasn't it received more attention? It is one that I feel should have been discussed at least once so far, but I don't see that it has. If you have noticed any discussions of related issues, please let me know.</p><br><p>One important point here is to remember that the Fermi and Drake problems are not the same question. The Drake equation says what is the <em>likelihood that life exists</em> in a civilization somewhere in the Universe. If all we were to care about was life in our planet, then we wouldn't need to worry about the Drake equation at all \xe2\x80\x93 the question is whether life at all exists on Earth in the first place, not whether someone will find it by searching it in the Universe. So the Fermi mystery and the Drake equation are, like the Fermi puzzle and Carl Sagan's observation, two closely related puzzles that together are one.</p><br><p>But there is one important point that I would like to get some insight into, and that's the Fermi argument, so this is the place where it would be nice to discuss it. I've been having some trouble understanding some of the details of the Fermis, and I'm curious if anyone has thought of any way to make it clearer. Any questions about the Fermis are appreciated. The link to the PDF contains the argument, and the Wikipedia entry has some details about the argument in the "Probability" section. Thanks!</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
