The alien species uses human space capsules to reach other stars. The alien species wants the AI to create a ship that will land on _any</em> star in our galaxy, with the payload.</p><br><p>Now here's the problem\xe2\x80\x94and this is where the rocket alignment problem differs fundamentally from the other problems with aligning Friendly AI:</p><br><ul>
<li>There's no human in the loop, no attempt at any cooperation, even an accidental one. Maybe the aliens aren't aware a problem like this even exists. But I don't see any _logical excuse _to let them take over human space travel.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The aliens use human rocket technology, they use human technology to modify rocket technology, it's just that the <em>payload _ends up in the alien spaceships instead of the human-designated slots, because _the rocket itself</em> isn't actually human, it's just <em>human-designed hardware.</em></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The real problem is that the rocket-alignment problem is <em>harder</em> than the Friendliness problem.  (I will expand upon this.)</li>
</ul><br><p>(Some readers may have noticed that this problem has been studied several times before, not just in the Vinge book but also in a paper by Michael Anissimov, a frequent contributor to this blog. I refer you, for a more extensive treatment, to <em>Creating Friendly AI__.</em>)</p><br><p>My main point here is that the rocket alignment problem is <em>hard.</em> If you put a spacecraft full-scale on a launch pad, and the spacecraft goes up and gets off the pad and out into space, the rocket works fine. It doesn't need to be Friendly.</p><br><p>It starts working almost like the time, because gravity well, so it's not going to get off the launch pad in the same shape, much less the same orbit, as it came from. That kind of mismatch of <em>actual physical existence _to _logical form</em> is the <em>hard problem,</em> and I'd rather see the math of general intelligence than talk about people being in the loop, or trying to cooperate, or whatever.</p><br><p>But it's a <em>real problem</em>. If you want to <em>launch a spaceship that gets off the launch pad, into interstellar space,</em> well, the rocket <em>really _isn't Friendly. It just _loses</em> mass. There's a hard, math-based problem:  How can we match the rocket's state of physical existence at _t_1 to the logical state _t_2, for any possible value of _t_2?</p><br><p>It could be that we're going to be talking about a lot of different, differently-shaped things, and we're going to have to figure out the whole mess. But the same sorts of basic mathematics would get applied to the whole mess, even then.</p><br><p>The rocket alignment problem does seem harder in all respects than Friendliness. To explain why human society will not be enslaved or exterminated by a non-friendly alien species using nanotechnology, I would have to explain, in some level of technical detail, what a mind is and has to go through in order to be non-slavish. The rocket alignment problem, by comparison, is simpler\xe2\x80\x94at least, that's what everyone seems to think. And I say everyone, because if you actually <em>examine the problem,</em> it looks very difficult, very tricky, and very potentially a mathematical impossibility. People think about the rocket alignment problem and they think about the Friendliness problem, and they don't really consider the other two together.</p><br><p>In other words, the rocket alignment problem looks <em>more difficult than</em> friendly AI, which seems to everyone as being the obviously <em>easier</em> of the three problems.</p><br><p>It seems to me like I'm being rather _persistent _about making a point here. That's an odd thing to post just now, when I just said that this looked like the harder of the three problems; no one's made the comparison yet; and I really have no excuse to take it back except that I'm in the habit of doing things like that.</p><br><p>Well, in case you've forgotten it, just because I brought up some difficult mathematical questions doesn't mean they're the <em>only</em> difficult philosophical questions\xe2\x80\x94though I _do _see more difficult philosophical problems than more difficult mathematical problems.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
