<p>In this article I will show you how to solve a problem that stumped for millennia the world's most prominent mathematicians. The problem is a famous open question in number theory: Is every perfect number divisible by either 3 or 5?</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The most famous proof was given by the Chinese mathematician Bai Juyi in the 12th century AD: the answer is that either a number is divisible by 3 or it is divisible by 5.</p><br><p>By algebra, we can prove that if 3 divides any integer, then 15 also divides it; or, if 5 divides any integer, so does 10. But all integers have either 3 as a divisor or 5 as a divisitor. Therefore 3 is a divisor of an integer if and only if the integer is divisible by 6. This follows from the law of least squares because 3 is not a multiple of 6 but 6 is. Hence neither 3 nor 5 divides an integer if and therefore if the integer is a perfect number.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>In other words, the proof we find in the literature assumes knowledge that the reader would find unlikely to appear in first year undergraduate mathematics: that the notion of integers, the notion of the divisibility relation \xe2\x89\xa4, and the notion of an integer being perfect.</p><br><p>The proof, written by John Baez, is in fact very short. It runs as follows. Let m be an integer of the type x2 + 2px for p = 3 or x2 + 2x for p = 5. The first step is to show that if P(z, n) = m = x2 + 2pm, then P(4, n) must equal (x4 + 2px4) \xe2\x89\x88 m3 or (x5 + 2px5). The proof that P(4, 5) \xe2\x89\x88 m5 is then immediate.</p><br><p>The next step is then to show that if m is not divisible by one of 5, 3 or 4 for some integers m and n then P(z, l) for l not equal to m is not equal to m for some integers z and n, the numbers which appear, in that proof, are taken to all be positive and less than some unspecified integer T. So if m is not a multiple 3 or 5 of some integer, then m = x2 or m2 is not a multiple p3 or p5 of an integer. But by the prime number theorem, or by the fact that the only perfect cube is 12, we must have either p3(n) is not divisible p3 by p5(8) or p5(n) is neither divisible by p3(8) nor p5(8). In either case, we have that P(z=8, 8\xe2\x88\x92n) = p3(q(z)) or P(z=3, 8\xe2\x88\x92n). Similarly, either P(q(z), 8\xe2\x88\x92n) or P(q(8\xe2\x88\x92n), 3) is not equal to p5(q(z) or p5, respectively. We can therefore show that P(z, 8\xe2\x88\x92n), P(z, 16\xe2\x88\x92n) and P(z, 24\xe2\x88\x92n) have the type of properties required for the generalized Chinese Remainder Theorem, and then use the theorem to prove that no such relations exist between z, n, and 24\xe2\x88\x92l, nor between n and 24\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x80\x94though in fact these relations do exist.</p><br><p>If we prove using this theorem that m and n are both divisible by 6, then we obtain P(q(12), n) and P(q(24\xe2\x88\x92n), x, or P(q\xe2\x80\xb2(x), n), where x = l not equal to 6(l) or 7(4\xe2\x88\x92l), and q\xe2\x80\xb2 = q\xe2\x88\xa52 with q = 5 in the proof of the generalized Chinese Remainders theorem. Letting p = 3 and q = 4 in each case, this is p3(q4) - 3p3(q4). Substituting p = 5, we get m = x2 and x2 + 2l \xe2\x88\x92 1 = 24\xe2\x88\x92l; then x = 6(l) and l = 5. Therefore we proved the result for m = x2, n = 16l \xe2\x88\x92 5, and q = 4, so x = 24l \xe2\x88\x92 5 and l = 3+4i for i = 1,2, and if x = 24l\xe2\x88\x925, then l = 5+6j so x = 24(2l\xe2\x88\x925)\xe2\x88\x925=12l\xe2\x88\x9210, x is not 6 and l must be 3 + 4j.</p><br><p>The final trick in the proof is that each of the above statements implies that some such relation is valid for all positive integers, and we also know that there does not exist a such relation for any positive integers m and n. So we have the result that either p3(l) can be expressed as p5(a) + b or a can be expressed as l\xe2\x88\x925 + b for some a in 1, 2, 4 or 6; this also applies to x7 where p = 3 and x = 24 \xe2\x88\x92 7 (the proof for x7 is slightly more difficult because there do exist relations between x7 and 24 \xe2\x88\x92 7 in 2 + 2i, 3 + 3i, 4 + 3i, and 5 + 3i. Using the generalized Chinese Remainded theorem, we showed that these relations are not valid).</p><br><p>What we have proved is the existence of a theorem of the form (M,N,r) \xe2\x86\x92 (3(r(m)+r(n)) \xe2\x89\x88 r(M+N)) with (M,N) for any M and M+N both strictly positive integers and r with integer coefficients that sum to 1 (i.e.r \xe2\x89\xa5 0, but not r &gt; \xe2\x88\x924 in our case). But by the principle of uniqueness of solutions in OEIS, there must also exist some relation of the form (N,r)\xe2\x86\x92(p(r(p)) \xe2\x89\x88 rp), with p one of 3, 5 and 25. To show that (M,N\xe2\x80\x941,r)\xe2\x86\x92 this would be enough, as it would show that p3(r(p(M + N-1))\xe2\x88\x925(p(rp) - 5)) = m; (3(rp)\xe2\x88\x925(p5-5)\xe2\x88\x92p55(rp)=1 so the result would be that p(q) is a multiple of r(q+1).</p><br><p>Baez goes on to say that he knows a proof on the number theory mailing list that does _not _assume the above knowledge:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>... that reader would find unlikely, in the modern Western world, to appear in first-year undergraduate...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>"You would think," writes Baez, "that the reader would realize that the knowledge of numbers that must be assumed in order to get the answer is simply the Chinese Remainder Theorems, the only theorems that have been proved in any detail, and the only theoress that have been proved at all, in any detail! That these theorems show that not all integers (or even all integers of the same type as the integers that appear in the theorem) are divisible by p for any prime p. They show that this is so, without the need of assuming anything at all about the integers that appear."</p><br><p>... the only perfect cube that is divisible by 25 is 12. It follows that p5 or p35 cannot be factors of a number of that type.</p><br><p>However, Baez says:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>If someone who is not an expert on primes and is also not an expert on integers can show without the use of a computer that the proof given above is correct, then the person seems to have caught one of the most elusive and important open problems in mathematics, and to have come up with a correct proof without recourse to any computer. This is all rather surprising. I can understand a first-year undergraduate who hasn't even heard of computers being able to do mathematics being able to prove a theorem by hand. But even if they know about computers, I can't really understand how someone <em>not</em> an expert in one of these fields could show on their <em>own</em> that the proof of the theorem above makes no use of computers. The proof that I gave does use computers\xe2\x80\x94though that's not really surprising, since computers are everywhere in mathematics\xe2\x80\x94but even to figure this out, one must use methods of computational number theory.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Baez writes:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>"First year undergraduates are generally too impressed with the elegance of their reasoning to realize that reasoning is more than elegance... If someone writes down a very clever argument, you shouldn't automatically credit this as an improvement over the old system they replaced." </p><br><p>The only proof of Liouvillian (for <em>every</em> p), and the only proof, in general, that can be given that doesn't use a computer, doesn't use the generalized Chinese Remainment Theorems, etc. was due to Vig\xc3\xa8s, as Baez admits.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
