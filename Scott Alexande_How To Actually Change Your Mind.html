That if you really understood what goes on inside the human brain, and understood all the genetic variants that were at work, and understood how they do and don't interact, you could perfectly explain why one person is smarter than a hundred other people.</p><br><p>There's probably more than one set of flaws to worry about. One could point out the fact that the people who made this particular study didn't test for genetic variants previously associated with intelligence\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the ones at which intelligence seems to vary most due to environmental circumstances. This could suggest that <em>these particular effects are not due to underlying genetics</em> and that we should be more reluctant to attach a single number to "general" intelligence than the case would otherwise suggest. Or, as Steven Pinker pointed out in response, maybe intelligence <em>is</em> 50% heritable. After all, if you look at the <em>gwern</em> dataset, it includes many individuals with the same intelligence who don't share any of your alleles. The problem is that the study was done in 2009, before <em>anything</em> like <em>gwern was known</em>. In 2009, people thought there were three different genes involved. For our purposes, the main one we're interested in is the <strong>Cumulative cultural evolution</strong> gene (<strong>CCE</strong>).</p><br><p>If intelligence is 50% heritable, but some of it is environmental, we may not be able to tell the two apart until after a large enough population has been sampled. What we can do is pick some measure of intelligence, and then compare the correlation between its average and some arbitrary gene, versus that between its average and its environment. If the correlation between environment and intelligence is high, and you expect it to decrease over time, you will end up assuming there is less than perfect heritability after all. But if environment is a perfectly good enough model of heritability that you can test for these effects without having to wait to see intelligence differences among populations that haven't had time to converge due to assortative mating, or other forms of selection, you may be wrong all of the time. So there's a tradeoff between "can I know intelligence is heritable" and "is intelligence heritable?"</p><br><p>Fortunately, some recent large studies have shed some light on this question, and at least one result should convince you intelligence is definitely heritable.</p><br><p>One group of twins raised in England did a study, "Are Twins More Similar Inside or Outside of the Laboratory?", and found that they were about as similar to each other as any other two people\xe2\x80\x94indicating, as psychologists put it, that intelligence is "highly heritable."</p><br><p>A more interesting thing to note is that people vary a lot in their "heritability" estimates.</p><br><p>The same group of scientists analyzed their results to see how much IQ overlapped between people. As can be seen in figure 1 (page 7), "nucleotide differences" accounted for an even larger percentage of the variance in intelligence than shared environments. More than forty percent of the variation in intelligence (the first two terms in figure 1) was due either to shared nucleotide differences among children at a given age, or to shared environment.</p><br><p>That means that most of how people differ in intelligence is due <em>not to genes,</em> but to <em>child environment</em>.</p><br><p>This isn't an isolated phenomenon. Most of the differences in intelligence between adult people we know of seem to be related to child development. We are only beginning to understand child development, but early findings show that a large portion of the impact of child environment has little to do with the parents' genes and more with social environment in the womb.</p><br><p>The most famous result of this kind concerns the Dutch-Indian-African <em>famine-famine-fever</em> curve (see figure 2). This line shows the <em>g</em> value of the average IQ of populations over time. As you can see, it goes <em>up</em> pretty quickly from <em>g</em> = 0.36 to <em>g</em> = 1.13 over the past two thousand years, which is roughly the time frame during which human population size was growing.</p><br><p>This could mean a couple of things. Maybe natural selection for increased intelligence worked faster in some places and slower in others. Or maybe the environment became worse as the world increased in population. Or perhaps some people just weren't so smart at birth. Or the environmental variables that affected development weren't exactly the same between populations. Or they were but the effects accumulated more slowly over time. Or some combination thereof.</p><br><p>If you know what you're looking at, you can see the <em>g</em> changes are happening faster than population can just about keep up.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>The genetic impact of culture on human development is not a new idea (for instance here, here, or here). But this new analysis of intelligence is something I think will be extremely important as a sort of natural experiment.</p><br><p>The genetic link between intelligence and culture is hard to get past your mind. The study finds that shared environment is responsible for 30 to 60% of the IQ differences between average people. This corresponds to a massive interaction between our genes and our environment. It makes sense that the most important variable in our genetic makeup is the one that can affect intelligence the most\xe2\x80\x94how quickly or slowly do we learn languages or dance the way we do, whether we get along with the people around us, and so on?</p><br><p>But once you <em>do</em> get past your mind, this connection can be much more obvious: you can point to a hundred people, all of whom are identical apart from some small differences in a single environment. You know the environment has an effect on their cognitive development. And then you ask "Where do intelligence differences come from in the first place?"</p><br><p>One possibility is that intelligence is 100-percent heritable, and the heritability of intelligence is 100-% genetic. In which case you might ask "Are all the differences in intelligence due to genetic variation in intelligence? Or is some of this just environment?" We don't know for sure, and we will learn more about this as we see more and more studies. But it looks like the answer is a pretty big <em>n</em>.</p><br><p>Or maybe intelligence is less than 100-percent heritability, and some of the variance is due to environmental influences. This seems pretty likely if we take figure 1 at face value: we see that forty percent of the variance in <em>g</em> between individuals is due either to shared differences in the environment, or to individual environment. Forty percent might seem like low enough a percentage that we do not need to worry about further breakdowns of variance being due to shared environmental influences, or even genetic ones. We could say that an individual's variance has a base rate of genetic effects of 0.4 on average\xe2\x80\x94no other environmental factors have a bigger impact.</p><br><p>This assumption is not very strong (or not at all strong). We know that the <em>g</em> of some populations are higher than other populations because of things like selective pressure, which can give a gene a big effect even if it has only a small base rate. Also, we get this idea of the British-Indian-African famine-famine-fire curve that everyone's heard of\xe2\x80\x94it is the reason the <em>g</em> number in the first place can be used to estimate genetic intelligence differences. But it could be that the other stuff about the curves is a result of environmental influence, and we just happen to have chosen this one because they happened to be more informative than everyone else.</p><br><p><strong>III.</strong></p><br><p>There are a couple of other things we can do to look at IQ and "nature" to see if there is a connection that can help us distinguish the environment from the genes. Some recent studies have done so.</p><br><p>For starters, there's the paper "The genetics of cognitive abilities" by the same group that did the original twin study. This study found that cognitive abilities were much more heritable than intelligence\xe2\x80\x94a genetic factor accounted for about 40% of the variance. But there were also environmental factors; genes only accounted for 15% of the variance, but they tended to "overwrite" the effects of our environment. These results imply that environmental variables are at work for the same sort of reasons that make genetics so big a factor in intelligence, and that heritability might be overestimated by studies on IQ.</p><br><p>This suggests the following approach: Take all the studies of intelligence you know of (e.g. IQ or g, gwern), and ask which variables they do <em>not</em> control for. If you find environmental stuff, that argues for environmental influence. But if you don't find environmental variables, that rules out environment as an explanation\xe2\x80\x94at least to you. It could still be that we're missing some environmental effect on intelligence, or that environmental effects are not as common to a wide variety of cognitive processes as intelligence. This would also suggest that even a huge number of intelligence differences are partly due to individual environment. Or maybe intelligence is one of the cognitive abilities most affected by heritability, and that explains away the differences (but not <em>all</em> the differences; we also have the twin study).</p><br><p>There are even some studies on intelligence and various <em>g</em> factors that do not test for cognitive traits, in order to isolate heritability. The results tend to be <em>lower</em> than the heritability numbers for intelligence estimated directly from intelligence test data. This suggests that intelligence is partly due to environment, but there're other factors going into intelligence.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
