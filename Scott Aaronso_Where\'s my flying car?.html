His post and my rebuttal focus on the practical engineering challenge of building a vehicle with the required structural integrity and aerodynamic capability to land and park on the sidewalk. Yet it strikes me as instructive also to look at the more fundamental issues raised by the prospect of personal aerial transport. See this video talk for my current thoughts.)</em></p><br><p>Aerial vehicles are great, and indeed, many humans currently <em>rely on</em> aerial vehicles (e.g., aircrafts, motorcyclists, snowboarders, skiers, hang gliders, gyromites, etc). But why stop there?</p><br><p>If it's the case that "a human can walk 10 miles in 3 days, a motorcyclist can do the same in 12", then why not also have a flying motorcyclist?</p><br><p>(I know what you're thinking: "Oh no, Scott. I can't ride a motorcycle, and certainly not on sidewalks!" To which the question, "But how is the riding of the motorcyclist a different matter from being transported in a flying vehicle then?" seems more relevant. So I'm asking here.)</p><br><p>What matters, of course, is not only transportation, but also cost, speed, and safety. So how much is each of those going to cost? </p><br><p>Well, let's start with price. And in this domain I have some interesting news. It turns out that all that matters, mathematically speaking, is not the size of the payload, but the size of the airframe. As a basic matter of course, an aircraft's flight time in a fixed energy budget is proportional to the square of the payload's weight, while the fuel costs are proportional to the payload's weight and its squared volume, and airframe space is proportional to the payload volume and its squared surface.</p><br><p>In other words, from an economic viewpoint, a flying car with a given mass is <em>cheaper</em> than a comparable (in terms of fuel consumption, speed, etc) non-flying one. This does not say that we could make one for $10 million dollars and sell them to millionaires (although who says we <em>can't</em>?), but it does say that the $10 million dollar price would be a relative bargain.</p><br><p>Or to put it at least semi-formally: Given a fixed level of transportation capacity, the economic cost of the transportation infrastructure for a single car (for instance, the cost of all the streetlights and roads) will scale proportionally to the car's weight and the square of the car's volume, while the cost of the vehicle itself scales proportionally to its weight and its volume. Airframe costs in turn scale proportionally to a fixed factor, which we'll call the <em>fixed cost of transport</em>. If <em>f</em> is constant, then it follows that from a competitive standpoint, a mass flying car would be <em>cheaper</em> at any fixed airframe price than a comparable non-flying one, which in turn would be cheaper at any fixed cost of transport. Put differently: an object with a given mass and a given total volume and surface area for lifting energy will deliver the same payload for a given level of fuel cost if it is "flying" or not.</p><br><p>This is the first-order case. Second-order economics is slightly trickier.</p><br><p>In the airplane case, the fuel costs are a function of the size of the cabin, the engine, the fuel tank, and the aerodynamic form factor\xe2\x80\x94i.e., the size and shape of the airframe\xe2\x80\x94and this last factor in turn scales proportionally with the total size and volume of the vehicle. In fact, it turns out that the <em>maximum payload size</em> is given by the square of the minimum <em>average</em> aerodynamic cross-section of the vehicle (i.e., an airplane's <em>minimum</em> aerodynamic cross section) times the square of the vehicle's maximum takeoff speed, times a constant factor relating the vehicle's own maximum altitude to its maximum speed. And the <em>total cost</em> of the vehicle for a given payload is then given by a linear combination of the fuel costs and the cost of the land, buildings, etc. that the airport needs to build to house the vehicle. (The airport has a fixed overhead cost, irrespective of size.) See this post for a thorough discussion of the various ways in which the second-order economics of flying vehicle design is a function of payload size and thus a function of energy-to-payload efficiency.</p><br><p>A final note on aerodynamics. In the airplane case, we need to balance (a) the size of the aerodynamic lift surfaces, (b) the size of their airframes, and (c) the size of any lift-to-wing flaps/\xe2\x80\x8bailerons/\xe2\x80\x8betc. required to increase the size of the lift surfaces for any given size of lift surface. An airplane's lift to wing flaps, and thus its airframe, is proportional to <em>one-half</em> the lift of the winged body, and thus proportional to the square root of the size of that lift. Which is to say that, in order to get the same lift-to-lift ratio as in an airplane, we not only need a square-root-larger lift surface, but some means of <em>accelerating</em> that lift through a square root. An <em>additional</em> square root-larger airframe would be required, for which there's simply nothing that exists to do the math.</p><br><p>So that is the first- and second-order costs of flying personal vehicles: in each case the size and shape, and thus the airframe, matter.</p><br><p>For the vehicle size, this means that if someone can build a flying vehicle with the aerodynamic characteristics of a motorcyclist, then a flying vehicle with those characteristics is competitive for the <em>same price</em> as a comparable non-flyer. This is not to say that such an aircraft is economically viable. At present, all designs for commercial air transports are more than <em>three thousand</em> times as large as personal transport aircraft will ever be, as measured in mass and volume. If we could build the first modern flying car with the size and mass of any given non-commercial vehicle, then at present there is no economic reason for anyone to build it.</p><br><p>But is there a possibility that we may one day build a flying vehicle equivalent in size and cost to a current one- or two-seater motorcycle that would nevertheless offer comparable speed, fuel efficiency, and comfort? The key element, I believe, is the cost-efficient utilization of available airframe space. Note that the aerodynamic efficiency of a <em>person onboarding flight</em>\xe2\x80\x94i.e. the ratio of fuel consumption <em>on board</em> vs. fuel consumption <em>offboard</em>\xe2\x80\x94is <em>directly proportional</em> to the square root (i.e. 1/\xe2\x80\x8broot) of the size of their mass-to-lift factor. And the square root of a constant is itself proportional to the <em>logarithm</em> of the constant. So it follows that the airframe mass of a flying vehicle is proportional to the logarithm of the vehicle's <em>size</em>.</p><br><p>(This is one of those general facts that can be demonstrated using basic math. See for example this comment by Wei Dai: "There should be a law against this. It's really a simple mathematical fact, like that a motorcycle has one less degree of freedom than a flying car. The real problem is that the laws against this aren't written down, so people can't easily prove things like this using basic mathematics.")</p><br><p>This also relates to the design of aircraft wings. The reason that commercial aircraft wings have so much aerodynamic drag in the form of flaps and ailerons is <em>not</em> because they're so massive (the opposite is true! Those huge wings have the <em>opposite problem</em> of being much lighter than the fuselage they support). Rather, it's because each major surface area of the aircraft-wing is subject to the same constant lift-to-weight ratio, while the whole wing's lift is proportional rather than inversely proportional to its total size. By contrast, in the case of personal-transportation aircraft wings, their size is proportional to the cube of the aircraft's size, while their lift-to-mass ratio is only linear in the aircraft's size.</p><br><p>The result, as I see it, is two-fold:</p><br><ul>
<li>For any given size of personal transport vehicle, the first modern, mass-produced flying vehicle\xe2\x80\x94which, by the way, is probably more than three thousand times as large as the "Flying Car" of Douglas Campbell's day\xe2\x80\x94will probably weigh around ten times more total than the vehicle in its entirety. So even at today's scale, huge wings would provide an overall lift of a constant factor times the entire vehicle's lift-to-total weight, which in turn is proportional to the aircraft's size rather than inversely proportionality to the vehicle's size.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The cost of these enormous wings will be dominated by the cost of the fuel they burn, which has been proportional to the size of the aircraft rather than the other way around.</li>
