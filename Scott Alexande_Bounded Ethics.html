<p>What's with this obsession with what's wrong with morality? I don't see why any of that is necessary. There's nothing wrong with morality. Just set a high standard and strive to do better.</p>
</blockquote><br><p><strong>Bounded Ethics</strong> is what happens when you try to live up to a high standard. A bounded ethic is any rule that's hard-coded into your brain to help you not screw up too badly.</p><br><p>It's hard-coded because it's part of <em>who you are</em>. It's part of what makes you you.</p><br><p>__Inner Consistency __is when you want to live up to your standards, and yet sometimes don't, perhaps because of some external event or social group or whatnot. If you're not in that category, there's no problem.</p><br><p>Why would anyone <em>want</em> to be nice? Why would anyone _want _to make all their decisions according to their inner consciences? Good question, don't know the answers. </p><br><p>I know a lot of people who are what I'm talking about. A lot. </p><br><p>I want to write a sequence explaining this, because there's something so profoundly wrong here. The problem is that we have an inherent moral obligation to be nice to each other, but also to ourselves and our children. As Scott Alexander writes:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>It follows, then, that a culture in which people try to be nice to one another must include: a culture in which <em>people</em> can say, "I will take personal responsibility for not raping my daughter, because I do not want to." Even if _other people _in the culture say, "That's awful! I can't believe you think she's so worthless you want to rape her," the culture doesn't mean, "I will rape my daughter because she's worthless," any more than saying "Murder is wrong" means "I will lie" or "I will murder that person." People can't be compelled not to take advantage of someone if they won't, and there are certain kinds of people who would take advantage of a helpless infant. And then there are certain kinds who would take advantage even of someone who would be quite put out by someone who took advantage of them.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>So any culture in which we say, "You shouldn't steal from random strangers," must also say, "We shouldn't steal from helpless infants or ailing people who'd be put out by their loss, or children who've grown up under parents with no sympathy for them." And once you let that latter group off the hook, the former group takes over. This doesn't mean the former group suddenly gets to steal from random strangers. It means that, just like the culture has to say, "Be kind to each other," it now has to say, all the things that _don't _get to count as being bad, "But mostly, try not to steal from random people unless it's really really important and they will be really really upset if you don't."</p><br><p>There is no such animal as "good." There is only "good enough" and "bad enough." Not "good," not "bad," just "good enough."</p><br><p><strong>Excerpts from "good enough" morality</strong></p><br><p>My girlfriend gets mad at me when I let someone get on line before her or leave without helping the cashier at the grocery store. She's right to be mad, but her anger never reaches outwards to the whole of civilization. She knows perfectly well that I am not <em>unusually</em> bad at these things.</p><br><p>On the other hand, everyone I know has trouble <em>not</em> doing these things \xe2\x80\x93 it's just kind of a part of our brains that is programmed to care about our in-group. Insofar as we are unhappy we can attribute this unhappiness to a missing part of us. It is part of who we are. This is a part of the "bounded morality" that Sinceriously says is hard-coded into our brains.</p><br><p>Every once in awhile a friend of mine has a big fight with their significant other, breaks up, and then doesn't speak to them for a <em>long</em> time. My girlfriend knows perfectly well that this person hasn't been _unusually _kind to anyone, and that they haven't deserved to get cut off of my life savings to bemoan their suffering. We both know that this isn't what goes on in their mind, and that it's just part of what makes them the person they were before the big fight. It is part-n-par-t that we have both known since before we met, and that both of us are able to hold as part of our personhood that other people aren't innately worthless but only hard-wired to have that particular feeling about themselves and only particular people.</p><br><p>Of course this will work at a personal level until some weird virus gets into your head. My girlfriend and I get along fine. But if one of my roommates started trying to take advantage of my girlfriend \xe2\x80\x93 maybe he'd just been really unlucky in love and needed a rebound, but all my roommates knew that if he did it again then he wasn't going to get another chance \xe2\x80\x93 there would be absolutely no question that it was an offense to both of us and we'd fight it.</p><br><p><strong>I think, "Huh, wait a minute, I never noticed that before. This might actually be important."</strong></p><br><p>I guess there's some kind of "human universal" under which every individual human being is innately worthless <em>and</em> evil? I mean, I always knew that it looked really strange to me to be so upset over something as innocuous as an innocent cashier leaving the store without a customer. But until I read Sinceriously it never occurred to me that such a thing might be true. And the more I thought about it, the less it made sense. The cashier is <em>doing their job. _That means he and everyone else _already _are in fact innately worthless and evil, so why can't he just quit and live a life of blissful happiness somewhere else? It's kind of like how when God made human beings, he made them so bad at making their own choices that He gave them commandments like "Thou shalt not commit murder or steal from anyone else unless it's really important and everyone will be really really sad if _you don't</em> do it" because the commandments themselves had been hard-coded into every human brain. </p><br><p><strong>I feel the need to point out that this is an incredibly obvious observation and the reader is quite welcome to have overlooked it.</strong></p><br><p>At this point I'm sure my readers have guessed the part about how I've been a <em>whole</em> lot more evil than you ever thought. But you may be surprised to learn exactly what that looks like. My recent post "On being a little bit evil" talked about the old saying from before the enlightenment \xe2\x80\x93 that a perfect Buddha may have <em>no</em> evil in them at all. I think I'm sort of like that. As far as evil goes \xe2\x80\x93 I don't <em>care</em>. It kind of makes sense, considering that I've given my mind the sort of space to create a mind rather than have one created for me. Sure, there are a few people who I can't be unkind to, people I feel an obligation to be kind so we can all stay happy together on the savannah. But the same way I find it <em>extremely difficult</em> not to be nice to others, I find it <em>very difficult</em> not to do unspeakable things when a good end could be at stake. Like if something horrible were happening in front of my eyes and I didn't know what to do.</p><br><p>I'm not so different from the average Less Wrong reader (I imagine that's more or less Sinceriously's point), and neither are you because evilness is just as hard-coded into us as goodness is. And on the one hand, I'm glad for this. On the other hand, all that sounds like a recipe for having awful ethical dilemmas and then screwing them up so hard you end up with a post at Less Wrong saying "Wait a minute now, can you all just give up on this whole 'we're all born evil' thing?"</p><br><p><strong>The good dilemma</strong></p><br><p>I'll start out with a classic dilemma in moral philosophy:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Two soldiers are trapped in a trench alongside a single prisoner, and must decide whether to shoot and kill him or not. Each soldier has a gun in his possession which he believes to be capable of killing the prisoner but incapable of killing him or causing his death. He knows that the prisoner has a gun which he believes capable of killing both soldiers and of causing the death of both of them. Would either of the soldiers be justified in refusing?</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>The answer to this problem appears to be "NO." If the prisoner refuses and is killed, the two soldiers are justifiably guilty of murder. If the prisoner refuses but survives, the two soldiers cannot be held responsible for his death, because it was prevented by the existence of the third gun. On the other hands, since each soldier's gun is incapable of killing him, if one of the soldiers were to refuse and the prisoner were killed, he would not be responsible; likewise if the prisoner were to refuse and were killed in refusing.</p>
