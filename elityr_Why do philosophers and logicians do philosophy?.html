I'm thinking of several levels of abstraction, some of which might have more to them than just the individual. Some of the possible answers include:</p><br><ul>
<li>what is the job like? How often does one do it?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>what do people really want to know?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>is there an objective standard for deciding what is a good argument?</li>
</ul><br><p>Another question is: there aren't that many philosophy grad programs, which is why there aren't that much philosophers; does anyone know how many philosophy professors there are in the world? If there are enough job opportunities for philosophers in a field, I would expect for each professor to do philosophy for the same sort of job on a smaller number of clients in that field. But why did I end up working on philosophy rather than something else?</p><br><p><em>This question is related to the following posts:</em></p><br><ul>
<li>The Nature of Philosophical Commitments</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophical Progress: A Case Study</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is the Problem of Induction?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Induction</li>
</ul><br><p><em>I am not an expert in ethics, philosophy of science, metaphysics, or decision theory. If anyone has a recommendation on these topics, I would appreciate it. If I'm going too off in the wrong direction on these questions, please say so.</em></p><br><p>Philosophers and logicians as a group do some kind of job. It's easy to say "philosophical work" and be vague about what exactly that is, but I'm not too bothered by that ambiguity.</p><br><p>I've been trying to figure out what that job is and what's necessary to get you good at it. I've asked a lot of other people (such as David Bourget at CHAI) about what the job is and how to get good at it, but I keep getting the same kinds of answers: "It's an intellectual thing and you do it because you're interested in how the world works" or "You do it to get a good feel for philosophy and to see what's out there."</p><br><p>I've thought of a few ways of framing the job that might explain what is needed. I haven't found any of them compelling, but I'll share them anyway.</p><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy is like a job in some respects, but in others it's like a hobby.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy must always be in the dark ages, trying to figure out old questions that everyone already knows the answers to.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy has to be the most obscure of all professional occupations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy is a matter of the mind, which is the last science.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy and the question "What is truth?" are the only two things that matter in the universe. No other profession has that many job openings.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy exists at a time when everyone else is looking away, so you got a good job.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Philosophy isn't like any other profession, so you might not have any of the prerequisites necessary to get a job in that profession. For example, you might be at a disadvantage because you're a man and in the fields of philosophy there's a dearth of women.</li>
</ul><br><p>None of these explanations are satisfactory.</p><br><p>In the previous comments, user:thomblake said of the first explanation:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I strongly suspect that you should try to find a way to do something more useful with your life, and then ask how you do that.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Like what might be the most promising career in which to do that? I suspect this will be highly personal and difficult to answer, but one good way is to start with cognitive research.</p><br><p>The cognitive work is of course different for different individuals...</p><br><p>A good way to start with the question is: is there any reason that people might want to know questions like "What happens if I turn the sun on?" or "Am I the sum of these things my atoms are made of?" or "If I'm a rock, how can I know about'self?'"?</p><br><p>One interesting possibility is people interested in these questions would be better off if more questions were being asked. Or if there were some reason they ought to know the answers to these questions. For example, there might be some useful implications of finding the truth about these questions, and no one has bothered to consider that possibility.</p><br><p>Or maybe this entire question, which has become the topic of much debate over the last few thousand years, is just not very important. "What is truth?", after all, is not one of the things the universe "matters" and it seems odd that anyone would think it really did.</p><br><p>The truth is, it's hard to make these sorts of questions go away just by working on them, though I certainly have seen people go some of the way there.</p><br><p>If in fact these questions are important for certain people, then we really need to know the answers. The first step to figuring that out is to start asking what's important in life.</p><br><p>The first commenter seemed to have a more concrete proposal: "I think you should go to grad school and think about the question, 'what is this thing that people care about?'".</p><br><p>The first comment made me want to know how many people have this kind of attitude. Can anyone give me a number of philosophers out of all their years studying philosophical questions?</p><br><p>Do people generally go into philosophy when they don't have other professional paths planned out?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
