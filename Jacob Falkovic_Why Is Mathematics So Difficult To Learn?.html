Some quick quotes from that post.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>In schools, children from a low socioeconomic background are often encouraged to work harder on their math exams than those from a high socioeconomic background, even though the former group consistently does worse on the tests.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>Math, physics, and chemistry tend to be perceived as the hardest and most prestigious of the sciences. In reality, physics and chemistry are at the bottom of the ranking on the percentage of subjects that are cited in research papers. (I'm not sure how to look this up.)</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>Science teachers often don't have a clue about how to teach physics, chemistry, or biology.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>There is a huge demand for teachers, and it's very difficult to get hired without a PhD, and the best schools don't have good programs to train future teachers.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is usually taught in high schools with teachers who want to signal that they can teach calculus to anyone who walks into the room.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>Some of the main characteristics of mathematicians are obsessiveness, attention to detail, and an insatiable desire for new ideas. That's not true for most scientists. If new ideas are more important than the work itself, math majors become research assistants.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>At the time I wrote those posts, I was working fulltime at a university so I could continue to study math after the undergraduate degree. I left last year, and although I'm earning more than I did at the university, I'm also working much less. As a result, Putanumonthas become a lot less regular. And one of the perks of being an unemployed grad student is I get the privilege of being paid to write, so I just went exploring.</p><br><p>This is the fourth installment of a post about what my research has to say, but it's only a small part of the full story. The rest of the post will be about the things I've learned about the mathematical world in the past decade. It's not likely that my summary of a field will accurately describe the topic itself. Just so long as it'll leave you with an understanding of what's out there.</p><br><p><strong>The Sequences</strong></p><br><p>In the early 2000s, Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote some blog posts intended to teach you the meaning of life in a fun way. He called those blogs \xe2\x80\x93 as opposed to his more serious <em>OvercomingBias</em> blog \xe2\x80\x93 the <em>Less Wrong</em> sequences and in 2006 he published the best of them in book form, now called <em>The Sequences</em>. Many of Less Wrong's most prolific commenters got started by reading the sequences, so one of the more interesting aspects of the blog is the connections it makes with its parent blog.</p><br><p>In one episode we find Eliezer going through the sequences once again in the "How To Actually Change Your Mind" series.</p><br><p>And here is the <em>best</em> one of the six episodes. I don't know why he's reading about Bayes' theorem here and now, but by the end of the episode I find myself convinced it's the best book out there on Bayes' theorem.</p><br><p>I think that some of Eliezer's later posts have a lot to do with the community that grew up around the sequences on Less Wrong, but the above videos demonstrate that even I was surprised by how much of "What do you want to change about yourself?" is about <strong>Bayes' Theorem</strong> to its credit.</p><br><p>The Sequences became a popular book on rationality because...</p><br><p>...Rationalists and people who were interested in instrumental rationality went looking for ways to apply the lessons they learned from the Sequences in their everyday lives. It's not enough to change your thoughts by thinking about rationality. There is a whole slew of other lessons, some of them surprising, lurking in the texts of the Sequences.</p><br><p>Here are my 10 favorite lessons from the Sequences, according to the people who keep bringing them up in my conversations. They range from the obvious to the very surprising, so I have some hope they'll resonate with you. If you're new to the Sequences or want to re-read those posts that resonate most strongly with you, I highly recommend this book. It's fun to read as rationalists, and after you read the Sequences yourself you'll be even more excited for what this community has learned since their formation.</p><br><p>If you only read the Less Wrong sequences and don't click through to see what's on the other side, I recommend reading the rest of these bullet points from either the book above or this article, which you can still browse the embedded images from.</p><br><p><strong>Probability___ ___is___ ___in___ _the map.</strong> It's an interesting philosophical and psychological topic that ties in to a bunch of other Less Wrong posts and is used heavily here. A more technical, mathematical, and empirical gloss on the topic, which I recommend is Yudkowsky's <em>Epistemology of Disagreement</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Frequentist and Bayesian thinking are both good, and you can use both in situations where you expect to be right more often than wrong.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Arguments are soldiers.</strong> The more soldiers you have, the better. And just as it's good to have soldiers on both sides of an argument, it's even better to have soldiers on each side of an argument. Here is a quote from <em>The Sequences</em> I keep running into on LW:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I used to think the purpose of debate was to settle the truth. I no longer believe that. The purpose of debate is to <em>win an argument</em>. The more interesting and passionate the debate, the more intelligent and thoughtful the debaters, and the more carefully and publicly the debate is conducted, the more useful it is as an aid to the education of public officials or as an aid to collective persuasion. Once a debate is over, the only thing that counts is the final vote, and the winner will\xe2\x80\x94if the debate was honest, intelligent, and well-informed\xe2\x80\x94represent the majority view. [...]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Let me be quite clear on what I mean by being "honest": a debater cannot appeal to any statements made in "good faith" without thereby admitting those statements to be true. Even if the statements were made in honest good faith, the dishonest debater must still be punished; otherwise debate is not completely honest. There is no such thing as "white lies". But when I use the expression "honest", I have in mind something more precise than "sincere" or "candid". I am not talking about the debater simply being "true to his beliefs". I am also not talking about someone who only says things that they believe to be true. This is why you sometimes hear people complain about "dissent from majority opinion", if someone is accused of being "disliked by the majority" [emphasis mine]. As though being "discontinuous", idiosyncratic and rare, made you "respectable". In our society, being against the majority is something you can either get away with or not, but if you say it openly you're guilty of heresy, which is something the church can get you for.</p><br><p>If some politician says "I am a feminist", you don't really <em>know</em> if he has the courage of his convictions\xe2\x80\x94until you call him on some specific thing he said females have no rights to, or that some woman was raped on his watch, and you discover some embarrassing fact about his views on family courts. If you say this, he is not only "playing politics", he is being "dishonest", because if he truly believed all those things he would never have said them in the first place. Similarly, if you call someone a racist under any circumstances, or claim you are about to call them one when it is obviously false, or argue in a way that you know to be false, then what you're doing is being "dissonest"; if you truly believed it you would never have said it.</p><br><p><strong>Belief is important, and you should take it seriously.</strong></p><br><p>If you are going to have beliefs, it is important that they be true beliefs and not beliefs that are convenient things to believe. You need to have a good explanation for your belief, and you need to take other people's beliefs seriously, so that's why it is worth debating beliefs. There's a difference between saying "I believe in human evolution" and "this tribe over here believes in human evolution" is very similar to saying "I believe X", "belief (or knowledge or whatever) in Y" and "belief in human evolution" because you're not really making a statement about human evolution you are just saying "I believe this".</p><br><p>If you're trying to understand a topic deeply, there's no substitute for a solid understanding of the basics, so that is where the actual work of understanding is done.</p><br><p>__If you say the truth, even unpleasant truths, you will have power. __When you share good advice that a lot of people need but rarely hear, this gives you power. It could be the power to change people's minds, or the power to win arguments. Or even (though it's a much broader field of study) the power to create beauty.</p><br><p>As long as you share good advice, beautiful things will happen.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
