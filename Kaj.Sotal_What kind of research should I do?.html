Getting to do it when you are a student, and not having to feel stressed about it but being able to concentrate on actually doing the research, are particularly difficult aspects. And there aren't that many jobs in such research. If you just want to get a part time work done, you can always do research as a hobby for the fun of it. But if you want to spend your time doing important research full time I fear that you'll have to set aside at least some of your other desires, in some sense. If you have any practical advice on how to balance this out, I would be especially interested to hear it.</p><br><p>It seems that if you want to be good at what you do, some areas of study are better suited to you than others. For example, you could probably get into physics if you were really motivated to do a physics degree, but you have your hands tied if you want to study mathematics. If other subjects are less easily available, it makes sense to figure out how to leverage the other options that you do have. On the other hand, if you're studying art history I think the chances of picking up an interesting question in an important area of study which has practical applications is almost nil.</p><br><p>What sorts of studies are most likely to be useful? I've always liked history, but in studying it, I've often become aware of research questions that I could have gone and looked up on my own, but which were hard to find through Google searches. So if this sort of thinking seems more useful than pure maths, I'd want to study history, but if it seems more useful to study pure maths, then I'd want to do pure maths.</p><br><p>And it does seem to be the case that there is a sort of "learning by doing" and a sort of "explaining your ideas to other people" aspect to research. There's also a sort of "getting on with it" factor and of "just getting on with it." I'm probably being a bit unfair here, but I think I've always found that the learning-by-doing aspect a little bit more important than the explaining-to-others aspect, while the getting-on-with-it-part comes across as if it is more important.</p><br><p>Also, it seems that there is a different aspect to research. Sometimes there seems to be a sort of "sitting down and thinking with no distractions" mode, and sometimes there seems to be such a mode with distractions, but this mode is generally very productive and valuable. On the other side of things, there is a mode that seems to be more suitable to most people. It's when you just pick up what you want to do and start doing it, whether or not you want to explain it to anyone. Of course, if you're actually working for a publisher on a big-selling book, some people's editors will demand your ideas\xe2\x80\x94it would be bad if an otherwise valuable idea were rejected just because it was so unusual that no one had heard of it before (in certain circles).</p><br><p>I'm not quite sure whether the two modes are to some extent separable. It seems like the problem is that if you have an idea, it's hard to concentrate while doing chores (e.g. preparing the next meals) and so you just have to sit down and do it. On the other other side, there sometimes comes a time when you learn to trust yourself and just do things because it's important for you to do it even if that means you might not be able to explain in words exactly what it is that you're doing.</p><br><p>So, what type of research is most useful for you personally?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
