This position emerged from Kant's <em>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</em> and continued to be defended on the Western philosophical scene through much of its history.</strong></p><br><p>So that's where the "rights" come from, where do the "rights" end? It's not a simple question to answer. Some people are against the use of animal products, some are happy to eat meat. If there was some kind of general rule whereby the ends always took precedence over the means, the question would never be asked. But since you can eat meat and still feel good, you can use that as your end and argue about other ends in your particular case.</p><br><p>Some of the people who take this position are pretty much in favor of eugenics, for various interesting political and ethical reasons. Personally I'm not sure eugenics is right or wrong. My concern is that it will cause a lot of suffering and death for no reason. It's certainly not right to bring it into debate, though. And I would hope most people who take this side would support an open mind on eugenics\xe2\x80\x94and, by the way, a huge variety of other ideas and movements including radical leftovers like vegetarianism.</p><br><p>Now, of course there's a difference between "eating meat because it's my end" and "killing a healthy human adult, not because it's my preference"</p><br><p>For one, killing a living human being is clearly more atrocious than eating a meat or using animal products. And for the other reason, this is just not a general principle that should be observed and used as an <em>a priori</em> argument to support the worst atrocities. I would go even further and object to the way the first position is framed. It seems to assume that someone is saying "Oh no, I'm going to torture babies in utopia, that means I'm a bad person"? But in fact if you have a utilitarian position to start with, it's only because you were born with a utilitarian nature. There are no moral facts like that. </p><br><p>More importantly, though, there are ethical assumptions you can make which go from something quite acceptable to killing a human baby to something quite unacceptable, like vegetarianism. I won't go into this, there are links to discussion pages on this if anyone is interested.</p><br><p>A final point about the topic, which is also useful: If you don't eat meat or use animal products, in what other areas do you draw the boundary between the use of your "preferences" and the use of "moral facts" (like torturing babies)? In any case, it is well to be skeptical when someone uses an argument from the "ends" without telling us what <em>you</em> think are your ends.  </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
