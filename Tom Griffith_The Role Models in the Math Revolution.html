</ul><br><p>The history of mathematics before 1900 is complex. The most important and fruitful time to study it was probably the second half of the 20th \xe2\x80\x93 the post 1900 revolution where mathematical fields, previously focused on proof and logic, were refocused on solution.  </p><br><p>These fields are referred to as <em>formal</em>, and the revolution as <em>the math revolution</em>. It is important to understand the history of the progress of mathematics from 1800 through to 1940 because in that time formal proofs and computer programs started to become the two most relevant methods to solving mathematics problems. These methods were fundamental at the time, and continued to become more relevant and sophisticated in the next century.  </p><br><br><p>The history of mathematical development up to 1940 is the focus of this post. This period of development is referred to as <em>the formal mathematics period</em>. After that, as computing becomes more important to what is then a greater mathematical community than before, computers, and the use of machines, and their impact on mathematics, become more important as well.   </p><br><p>What this means for computer programmers, but more particularly for students of mathematics and artificial intelligence that are interested in learning, is that there has been a growth in the amount of work that is being done on problem-solving in mathematics (and computer science) after 1940.</p><br><p>The purpose of my post is to provide a guide to what the problem-solving nature of mathematics was, how this changed from pre-1900 to post-1900, and what were the implications for problems being solved today. I have tried to limit my references so that this is not a complete picture but rather an important, though necessarily an incomplete, summary of the work done up to 1940.</p><br><p>One particular issue that needs to be discussed is that of the relative development of the subject of computer science. The problem solvers are more recent than many other things in mathematics and computer science, and, indeed, even that problem solvers existed long before computers were invented\xe2\x80\x94but the _impact _of computer science has been much greater.</p><br><p>Some of this post is drawn from the paper "The Computer and Mathematics up to 1955" by Donald Knuth, published in Springer-Verlag in 2002.</p><br><p>The problem solvers</p><br><p>Problems are often of two types: <strong>mathematical problems</strong> that you are trying to solve and a  <strong>computer program __that produces a solution to the problem (if one exists).  But, if a computer program to solve a problem is not available, we can still solve the problem mathematically. In this case, the problem solver is referred to as a __mathematical problem solver</strong>.</p><br><p>Before the use of computers, in what is now called the formal mathematics period (starting after 1900), all such mathematical problem solvers were "human", and were known as <em>human mathematicians</em></p><br><p>What human mathematicians typically did is to use the tools of mathematics in an attempt to solve a mathematical problem.</p><br><p>If we were to try to list the problems typically solved by human mathematicians, we would find the list included, among other things:</p><br><ul>
<li>Arithmetic\xe2\x80\x94The multiplication table, addition and subtraction tables, powers of numbers like 7^3, and division by any positive number.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Calculus\xe2\x80\x94What's new?, differentiation, integrals, exponents, log and trig functions, integration, and solving differential equations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Algebra\xe2\x80\x94Linear relations and vectors, matrices and matric derivatives, determinants, matrix inverses, eigenvalues solving matrices.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Analysis\xe2\x80\x94Functions and differential equations.</li>
</ul><br><p>The above list is, however, by far not exhaustive\xe2\x80\x94the list I have just shown is the <em>traditional list</em> of problems faced by human mathematicians up to 1900. This list is quite different if we look at another kind of list, one of the most important problems of all and in which computers were not important at all:</p><br><ul>
<li>List of important problems in mathematics.</li>
</ul><br><p>This list is not without controversy, though. Different mathematicians have put forward the claim that some of the problems that would appear on this list have been solved, and that the remaining problems are essentially unsolved. Of these, at most one has been solved without computer help.</p><br><p>There is a second list that is even more controversial\xe2\x80\x94the list of what computer programs (and humans writing computer programs) _would have _allowed to solve:</p><br><ul>
<li>What if we had the whole works of the world's best mathematicians in an instant at our disposal?</li>
</ul><br><p>Given the choice, it seems that any mathematician would be more comfortable with the second of the above lists. The first list is the only one that is certain\xe2\x80\x94at least until someone has built a computer that is very good at mathematics.</p><br><p>It was an early example of this that Hilbert's program of a complete determination of <em>all</em> of mathematics was almost immediately after he had been published and a proof was announced:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>According to a bulletin on the occasion of Hilbert's seventieth birthday in 1900, his last letter to Freitag and Haimhausen before his death in 1902, which was also published in <em>Erster Offizier</em>, Hilbert took out of his desk drawer and put before the others a list of 10 problems... These are listed by G\xc3\xb6del number in that book, which means that the solutions, if any, are marked in that list with an 8. All of Hilbert's listed problems are of a certain type or in certain generality. For example, in No. 10 problems we have statements which either are proved or not to be proved in that theorem-proving. Here '<em>that theorem-proving</em>' means '<em>the whole of</em>' <em>mathematics__'</em>. And the statement to be proved is something that is needed in the solution of problem. If it were not, we could prove that a set of statements did not exist. But even in that case it would be important that these statements were true\xe2\x80\x94otherwise they would not be needed. This is an example of the kind of statement that the problem is formulated in order to obtain a solution. (Hilbert, "Probability and Truth".)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>It was in this spirit that Hilbert's program was started, and, up until 2000, continued, up until the year 2000. It was the only program thus far that attempted to do exactly what it said on the tin.  (It still is.)</p><br><p>The other programs are not so impressive as Hilbert's program. But they too were important progress, and the programmatic approach had enormous impact. Hilbert's program was used to prove Fermat's last theorem and the famous Twin Prime conjecture as well. The first program to prove that there are infinitely many primes (that is, that the 'twin prime conjecture' is true) was that of Ramanujan in the 1950s.</p><br><p>Even that is a story for an extra post.</p><br><p>This is the history, but what did all these problem solvers make out of these problems? How were they solved? There were of course many computer programs involved in the problem-solution process (a general-purpose computer like the modern P-100 would only become possible in the 1950s). It is of particular interest to study in more detail how a particular problem solver got to a problem, and its solutions. And we have two sources for this. One is the written records of what the problem solvers were being used for, and what the problems they were being used to solve were. Another source of data is the written records that exist of the problem solvers themselves\xe2\x80\x94the thinking of their minds as they worked to solve the problems. These sources are not perfect, but they are both surprisingly detailed and at times insightful.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
