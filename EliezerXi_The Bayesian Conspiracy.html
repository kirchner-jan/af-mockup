It goes into many of the details of the original post, but also spends a lot more time discussing some of my personal views.</em></p><br><p>One of the main obstacles to spreading Bayesianism is that a lot of scientists are very familiar with the ideas of group selectionism. The ideas of group selection are actually quite fascinating, and there's a fair bit of research into them. On the other hand, most of this research is done by molecular biologists, not physicists.</p><br><p>This is a case where it would be good for physicists to do their own separate research. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, most mainstream physicists don't really have any background in genetics. So I'm not at all surprised when someone who knows group selectionism ends up drawing the wrong conclusion about group selection.</p><br><p>(On the other hand, there are people who know a fair amount about biology and evolution, and who do have some background in theoretical physics. And I expect they do generally avoid the kinds of conclusions that are popular with group selectionists.)</p><br><p>The kind of research that would help spread the ideas of group selectivism is more closely related to physics or computer science than to biology or evolutionary biology. That kind of research would start with a relatively small, mathematically simple theory, and see if it leads to interesting conclusions.</p><br><p>Theories that look interesting at first glance deserve to be looked at from further angles as well. One possible angle is to make the math mathematically simple, but actually more complicated. In programming, for example, many complex but actually interesting programs are written with complex, but actually necessary, math.</p><br><p>Yet another angle is to take your math and make it more complicated, but to make everything mathematically simple while keeping the complicated parts simple enough for somebody to actually look at. E.g. if you start with a simple model with a very simple math, and then add a complication that makes the math harder, but more mathematically interesting, then it may be possible to introduce somebody's undergraduate math to that part. They then need to be told how it is related to more complicated math, but then their undergraduate math can be used again to verify that the "simplified problem" has the same answer, which allows them to eventually get to seeing what the more complicated math is.</p><br><p>Or maybe the math turns out to be much the <em>same</em> whether you start with a complicated math and add a complication that seems to have something to do with math, or start with a math and make it simpler. Maybe somebody who's never seen any of the math before will find a way to prove it from first principles, and then the complexity of proving it from first principles is enough to actually understand the math. (This is a lot like the difficulty of understanding quantum mechanics without taking any math classes, because the math is very simple, and the complications of the math are very complicated.)</p><br><p>This is what I'd like to see happen in the area of group selectionism: somebody starts out writing a theory (let's think about molecular biology as an example), and then a complexity is introduced that doesn't affect anything that happens before, plus a complication such that we can prove the theory from first principles. Then someone else tries to explain it to somebody who's never considered group selectionism. And finally, after being exposed to many different explanations, they discover how the original theory of what they were originally exposed to relates to group selectionism.</p><br><p>This sort of "expand first principles to make the math simpler" phenomenon in the abstract may be relatively common in science, but I'm more suspicious of it when it applies to fields where the whole problem is that the math is already so hard, we're not likely to be able to get rid of that complexity. E.g., when somebody invents a new programming language, that involves making a language more complicated, but also more structured and understandable, so that the complexity of the math is hidden by the complexity of the language.</p><br><p>One possible angle for tackling this problem is to look for fields where people know the math, or know things that make them think they know the math when actually they don't; and then convince them that the math is hidden somewhere deep inside their knowledge that many of them don't know yet.</p><br><p>Why might this be a good idea? Here are some angles:</p><br><ol>
<li>If a bunch of people are trying to describe something more mathematically complicated than required for somebody to understand, they have a good reason to add complications that add real things about the real world instead of just not affecting the math.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>There actually is math deep inside a field of research, but the math is very abstract in some sense and difficult to use to think about the real world, so nobody had really noticed that they were confused until now, and nobody knows which of the two possible parts of the math is actually the math.</li>
</ol><br><p>This is probably one of the most important reasons why I feel that group selection is an important issue to consider from a Bayesian perspective. There are two different ways in which a given mathematical model can be wrong.</p><br><p>First, there might actually be <em>actual</em> math in a math model that nobody knows about, and that adds something about the real world. If our math model adds some fact about real life, then we need to be able to tell when the math model is wrong, without knowing the math model in full. I don't really know if this is really how most physicists <em>expect their math</em> to turn out eventually, but I do know that the Bayesian Conspiracy exists, and it has been looking into this more than I do. So I'd encourage you to consider the possibility that there is actual math deep inside a math model that adds something about real life.</p><br><p>Second, there might be <em>non-actual math</em> deep inside a math theory, or deep in an idea in a math theory. E.g.: an important part of the idea underlying group selectionism is that evolution "selects" organisms based on how they perform in genetic competitions\xe2\x80\x94but is that an actual part of how evolution works? Maybe no one knows. In which case the math model describing the evolution of organisms based on genetic performance might be completely wrong. If that's the case, then maybe we can apply group selectionism to biology without ever realizing that we were using something more complicated than actual math. This is what I'd really like to see happen. </p><br><p>Why should this be possible in groups? Because there are ways of doing mathematical research without necessarily telling the other researchers how well their approach relates to your math model, and you should be allowed to publish papers about your approach in biology, without mentioning that you had a particular approach. And the math is hard enough, and you don't know your math model in full, that you have to be able to explain that you only mentioned particular parts of the math model and other people need to look at each individual piece and make sure that it actually connects up to the rest of the math model.</p><br><p>This isn't easy to do, and not all fields that are trying to do it are good at it yet. So I'd really like everybody to try to do it somewhere. I think that if enough people say "there's this mathematical complexity we need to get rid of", then eventually somebody needs to go through all the math just to find out what's in there, and if they need a whole complicated theory of everything before they can find out (for example, a theory that's equivalent to group selectionism), more power to em.</p><br><p>(An even better thing would be to publish a draft that includes the new math you added, but not the paper before which you need to explain what the math is. This is part of what allows me and other people to take seriously ideas that are not yet in a very rigorous math-y form.)</p><br><p>Group selection is cool stuff, even if we eventually prove the math and find out that there's no math inside. I especially hope it helps to spread ideas in physics and other areas of science where it's not yet clear that there's any math deep inside. I think a lot of the people who disagree with me on that are basically just doing math and not thinking of group selection. They are thinking too much through their own perspectives, and not understanding the perspective that someone who doesn't themselves do math could take.</p><br><p>If anybody is currently working on any related topic, here's a couple of ideas:</p><br><p>1) A good place to start would be to look at biology, and search for a mathematical model that connects group selection to evolution. Can group selection fit on a theory of evolution, and if so, how can we prove it?</p><br><p>2) Group selectionists should publish on their models, and see if other people notice that their models have anything to do with group selectionism, without telling them that it has anything to do with the mathematical model they're using. If a few people notice that their model of evolutionary biology "starts to sound group-selection-ish", then other researchers should be encouraged to investigate that idea. If there aren't any interesting conclusions to be had, then maybe we just need to go with the "real math" that's still there, and then maybe somebody eventually finds out that the math has something to do with the group selectionist model.</p><br><p>3) If somebody publishes a paper that proves that there's a particular math deep inside some math model that isn't useful, should that paper be allowed to be in the literature?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
