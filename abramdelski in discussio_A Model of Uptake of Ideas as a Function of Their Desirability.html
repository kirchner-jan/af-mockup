The idea is to give an account of what these processes <em>feel</em> like from the inside. Obviously we cannot make a full Bayesian model; that would require more work than can fit in this post. However, I believe that with this model we have enough of a framework to start understanding the difference between effective and ineffective ideas, to some extent. Note that I am not talking about specific people's opinions <em>now</em>; I am explaining what <em>kind</em> of model to have, in retrospect. I plan to write more about who these ideas come from in the future.</p><br><p>One thing that I find particularly interesting to note is that this model <em>does not give a great deal of weight to quality</em>. In other words, ideas can get into the community in several different ways, but these are not always "categorically different", as the model assumes. Furthermore, quality does not necessarily matter much at the start, since at these later points the community does already have a large amount of information about ideas. In fact, it seems to me that some of the highest expected value ideas will almost certainly have negative quality scores at the start of the discussion, but become high quality ideas as the discussion goes on; and of these, some may start high quality, and eventually drop to low enough quality that they will fall into the community at large. Since the probability of being picked up by the community is proportional to quality, this will increase the impact of the idea.</p><br><p>So, with all these considerations in mind, I have attempted the following model:</p><br><ul>
<li>The problem is solved. However, the status quo is bad.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There are no new, better methods to the problem.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There is no solution with a higher quality rating.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The community has no information about the quality of the solution yet.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If the problem <em>was</em> solved by a high quality solution without any new, better methods, but, no one in the community had ever heard of the solution.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The <em>current</em> community opinion on the solution is worse than average. Specifically, it is worse than average if the average opinion on the quality of the problem and the average opinion on an idea within the community are correlated.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The current community opinion on the problem is better than average if the problems are <em>not</em> solved; and this is true <em>even if a high quality solution has been previously tried out, but it never went through to the other side</em>.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The current opinion is worse than average <em>from external sources</em> (the community that picked up the idea) if the problem is really bad (or, it's not good enough that no one has ever come up with a solution worse than the original problem).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The current consensus opinion on the problem, taken together with a good prior should form a probability distribution over the various possibilities.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There may be multiple solutions with high quality.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The first few times there was a good idea, but it was unknown. Some random thing happened and now it is known but no one in the group had heard of it at the start ("I had <em>always</em> wondered what was going on in that country, and now I know").</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There are often new, better methods around.</li>
</ul><br><p>In this model, most ideas start low quality, and do so for years or decades without any clear indication of progress. I say years or decades, because <em>before</em> people hear of a new high quality solution, they have many opportunities to change their opinion from "we should have done something about it already" to "well the high quality solution probably needs to be tried in order for people to think of it". However, people do <em>not</em> have many opportunities to reconsider their opinion about this "bad solution". From their perspective, it's the status quo, and they should not consider that a solution is not viable. In general, even if they eventually get excited about a potential solution, there is not a huge amount of evidence that <em>this</em> potential solution is the right one. For most solutions, it is likely that something will have been tried in the interim, but I guess this is a fact about the world, not a fact about the ideas coming in. (I guess to be specific it's more accurate to say that, conditional on there not being a solution with a higher rating, <em>probability</em> it is that someone or something already tried it).</p><br><p>Eventually enough things will have been tried, and many opinions change to be the "average" opinion, even though there are not that many more attempts at better ideas in total. As a result, the average opinion on quality does improve after those first attempts, and by then the community already knows which solutions have, and which have not, higher quality ratings.</p><br><p>I don't think this model really addresses the issue of low quality ideas being <em>reinforced</em>. However, it does address the effect of high quality ideas being better taken up. I expect most ideas to fall somewhere below a certain quality threshold, and then get stuck at there for a while. This threshold could be anything from "low quality", to "too good for practical purposes".</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
