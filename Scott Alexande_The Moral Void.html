There is nothing to eat in the first shop you encounter, and no one to talk to in the first place; you've got to get that out of the way before you can decide where to go next, right?So you proceed to the second shop down the street, which you find to be equally deserted. By the fourth shop you've encountered two people in the same shop, with the same greeting, and a man in green military uniform telling you to come with him and saying things that sound vaguely about "my father knew a colonel" (the way the Colonel in the Army Uniform story is told). But the one with the purple shirt with the blue hair looks a <em>lot</em> more like that story, with his beard and clothes, and his smile. You wonder nervously what you'll do if he turns out to know the Colonel in the military uniform, and if he knows the Colonel in the purple shirt with blue hair. So you follow the man with the blue hair to a restaurant.But the restaurant only has two tables and a booth. You're just looking at the food options for the moment, though this restaurant isn't the first restaurant you've encountered, so you figure you can ask someone what they have. And there is a woman and a man sitting together at the table, but they are very, very <em>notable</em> people who you've never been in the other man's company before.You say "Hi," and they both look like they're expecting you to say something a whole lot bigger. "Hi," you say, and that's about it for a moment.What are you supposed to say next? You're pretty hungry by this point. You'd thought about mentioning that, but it sounds like a bad move to try and build rapport before the real reason for your visit is explained.You turn to the woman, and her face looks like <em>she's</em> expecting someone very big to say something very big, and when you mention that it's you in the blue-hair restaurant she just looks as though her mind is starting to wander.There isn't room to wait for them to finish talking, so you tell them about the Colonel. No, really, there's nothing to say. The other guy knows the soldier in the uniform, so he has the same feeling you do about this, except now "Colonel" becomes "General" or even "President" and you find yourself trying to figure out whether the other guy is more likely to know his father was friends with the real Colonel or one that was friends with the man with the purple shirt.The woman starts doing her own questioning about the President: he used to be a colonel too, right? Does that make sense? Do all generals in the army come from the same family? You're starting to think maybe neither of them know anyone who works at the restaurant. Or they've never noticed the food you've been buying up. You could just end up having to talk about the Colonel for days and never get to talking about the restaurant.This isn't a huge problem \xe2\x80\x93 the one with the blue hair seems kind of like the Colonel too. But the one with purple knows your Colonel, so you decide to make a special decision and say to the woman: "Hey, would you mind if I sat down?" There is a stool there, in fact.She looks a bit puzzled, but nods and points to the stool, and you sit down.For a few minutes a waiter comes by to take your order. This seems to confuse them, but they just ask you to wait and not order anything until they've spent more time getting used to each other and asking questions.The one with the blue beard thinks they have things pretty much figured out. "Hey," he says, "do you know your Colonel?" and "Did you know my father knew a colonel?" and "Did he really know a colonel or just someone who talks about knowing a colonel? There's nothing wrong with that, right?"So you give them your most honest answers, and try to figure out where they're going with it.The Colonel says he knows nothing about it, and then they both start explaining what it means that someone he knows knew a colonel in the military or in a different branch of military service than the one they grew up in, or what it means to have no military experience at all, or that it's really the other way around \xe2\x80\x93 he's heard about your Colonel, and he's wondering how he would know someone named Colonel with no military experience. You can see the Colonel doesn't know anything either, though he didn't know the details either. The Colonel doesn't know and the Colonel doesn't remember having been there, yet the other man was there, knows all about your Colonel, could probably talk about your Colonel in detail, and is absolutely certain that your Colonel was "a colonel's son".So you tell them about your Colonel in a way that they might actually get it and start to wonder why you're asking them all these questions \xe2\x80\x93 is your Colonel's son supposed to be a colonel or a general? Or could it be that "a colonel's family" is only a real thing when someone's family has experience in a particular branch of military service? Do they know your Colonel's family, or do you know your Colonel's Family? The Colonel doesn't remember either, but then you learn about the other man talking about "Colonel's family", so you can just guess what he means.The Colonel gets a puzzled look. "What do you mean, what do I mean?" he says. "I'm not crazy, you know. What's this about?"The other man looks a little smug. "Oh, you're not crazy," he says. "Why, I can tell it right away!"The Colonel looks somewhat annoyed at the assumption, but you sort of understand why he'd want to give it back to the other man to see if he got it.The other man gets a condescending look. "I'm sorry," he says, smiling slightly, "but if a man with such a distinguished family background as yours has never served in the military, I'm just not sure whether it makes any sense to call them a colonel's family. After all, your Colonel is, strictly speaking, a Colonel without any military experience, and a Colonel is the first rank in the military, so a colonel without any military experience makes no sense."The first man looks extremely pleased at having the conversation taken over. "Well, I don't have any military experience either, but I'm a colonel," he says, sounding very proud.The other man takes out a business card and writes something down. "So you admit that you're a colonel!" he says. "Here's a card for you to show them! It says so right here on the back. Well, I don't care how many stripes you've got; that's just how people usually think. People see no difference between a colonel and a general without the insignia."You think you can explain to the Colonel that actually a colonel without insignia, like being retired, is kind of like being a colonel and not really being in the military, because you weren't a colonel yet. But you're not sure how to explain without sounding confused. "But people <em>do</em> think a colonel is a colonel, regardless of whether or not it makes any sense, and regardless of their military experience."So you get up without another word, and return to the first restaurant, which turns out to have surprisingly good food.The second man has a look of annoyance on his face. "You didn't tell them I was in the military, did you?" he says. So you tell him you didn't because it would create a conversation they would prefer not to have. "You sure," he says, still looking a bit annoyed, "that your Colonel isn't the one for whom they're named? Oh, forget it, I've had it with this whole business. I'm going back to my family," and he and the other man get up from the table together and start walking toward their car.As the first man walks up to the car, he looks at you for a moment, then gets in.On their way out they seem to be having a little bit more of that conversation, with the second man looking like he wants to make sure you don't try and talk to them again. So you try some small talk just to be sure.</p><br><p>And now you're back in your own city without any further clues as to what the Colonel might be named after. But on the way back you're tempted to stop in at the Colonel's place of business for some lunch, maybe even make small talk \xe2\x80\x93 but you don't know what topic they might have as a topic of conversation. Maybe it would go fine, maybe not \xe2\x80\x93 you're not sure.So now you're back. You've got to figure out where you're going. "The Colonel's House" is the first name that pops into your head, so you tell yourself you'll try that out.But you're surprised \xe2\x80\x93 "The Colonel's Place" has a nice ring to it. You've been through the place before, and it had a nice ring to that too.So you decide to stop in and say "Hi" again and see whether they remember you or not.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
