</ul><br><p><em>(Crossposted from The Cognito Mentoring blog)</em></p><br><p><strong>The big picture</strong></p><br><p>My work at Open Phil is a little less than six months in and I'm getting to the end of it and I'm feeling like we covered a ton of big and small stuff. I'm not sure how I'll be able to keep up the pace, but in the meantime I've decided to write up some thoughts and questions for the community.</p><br><p>The work we've been doing in my time at Open Phil has been divided up into the following buckets:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>The Open Phil Foundation</p><br><ul>
<li>The Open Philanthropy Project and its grantees (e.g. GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators, The Machine Intelligence Research Institute)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>GiveWell</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Giving What We Can</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Centre for Effective Altruism</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>GiveDirectly</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Future of Humanity Institute</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Open Philanthropy's other grantees and initiatives (e.g., the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, Global Catastrophic Risks Institute, the Open Society for Well-Being, and more)</li>
</ul><br><p>I'd say we solved #1: "Doing the most good that we can."</p><br><p>I'd say that we'd made significant headway on #2: "Creating the infrastructure and environment to move toward a world in which we can solve the problems that we care most about."</p><br><p>I'd definitely say we had made significant progress on <strong>#3</strong>: "Creating a global context in which the poorest people in the world have dignity, prosperity, and opportunity."</p><br><p>Is this the same as #4: "Improved human life and well being, long-term."</p><br><p>I'd also say Open Phil is making significant progress on #5: "Building a better future for the entire human species."</p><br><p>Is this headway on #6: "Better predicting what the long-term future will look like."</p><br><p>I'd guess we're far from #7 ("Building a better understanding of how the world works") and further from #8 ("Build institutions that are better at solving problems they face") but we at least got to #9 ("Improve education") with our programs: A major focus on K-12 education in the US and India and an initiative to connect people in the US and the UK to local institutions in their own countries that help them make better decisions in their lives.</p><br><p>As I was noting in my weekly post, I find that a lot of what I do requires thinking about the big picture. Not necessarily in the sense of "all the important long-term problems and opportunities" but in the sense of thinking through the broad set of things that a philanthropic project has as its goals and trying to figure out what each individual thing could or would have to do for Open Phil's various grantees to be effective in the long-run. To take a small handful of examples:</p><br><ul>
<li>When I was working at Giving What We Can, we were trying to figure out the best ways to encourage people to get into effective volunteering, i.e. the value of working directly in service of a cause, and how to help people with low income to have more control over their own lives. I think we did a good job at #4, but to what extent #1, #2 and #5 were actually improved is beyond the scope of this post.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In the early days of GiveWell, we were interested in getting more people to donate to high-impact charities, but in the course of our testing and learning, we noticed that for many people, the thing they wanted to donate to was also helping other people in need. So we shifted to our current set of grantees, which focuses on helping poor people in one particular area (e.g, health, education). This is the basis for our current set of programs described in the two linked resources above.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We've been thinking about the best ways for us to support the EA Movement, the EA community's capacity to innovate and solve problems, and the movement's overall effectiveness. So now in our grantmaking we're more looking at more specific areas (like the impact of various EA organizational activities, and the effectiveness of various EA platforms) than just looking at general EA effectiveness. In general, though, we've been trying to be as transparent as we can to allow others to learn from our experiences, and so to the extent that #1, #5 and #12 are important to the EA movement, the main EA organization we're funding (Effective Altruism Foundation International) appears in those areas.</li>
</ul><br><p>Overall though, I feel like we might be making progress on #10 and #16, but not as much as we might be (we're interested in expanding access to key technology, but we haven't seen much sign of people making use of the tools we've offered them so far).</p><br><p><strong>What does "solve" mean?</strong></p><br><p>We've thought a lot about the value and drawbacks of using a "Solve the problem" strategy, though I'd guess not as thoughtfully as we've thought through GiveWell's current activities. In particular, it's important that we use a variety of strategies in pursuit of different areas. So if we focus 100% of our attention on X and fail to acknowledge that we're making a trade-off with Y, we have to be especially wary of this failing. We've also been focusing on these considerations in the early days of giving, when we felt less able to afford to overcommit to a strategy. Our current work, on the other hand, tends to make more efficient use of our time and focus.</p><br><p>So far, I think we've probably been too risk-averse. (For example, when we were experimenting with other sources of funding, I think we tried to make sure all the potential alternative donors had already been helped in ways we could reasonably understand, like getting out of poverty traps and improving the life of the global poor). But I also worry that in the long-term this will result in us missing many opportunities. It's important to "figure out who we are" in the same way that it's important to "solve the big important problems." So we're working on changing our funding strategy to be more risk-tolerant.</p><br><ol>
<li>Give people economic productivity</li>
</ol><br><p>I think the open economics movement has been remarkably successful at accomplishing #1, giving people better educational opportunities, making school more fun, and giving them more control over their future life paths. And I have a lot of hope for what seems to be an unusually positive set of social trends right now:</p><br><ul>
<li>We're seeing a lot of people getting richer, and generally getting richer has been good for the world.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People are going to places other than school, and we ought to make sure we give them the freedom to choose what that looks like.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Our current education system seems to not be pushing people to consider what they might want to do next, which seems to be a terrible loss to them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The trend of moving to online education platforms (or even away from schools entirely) continues. My guess is that it's going to make a lot of sense: not only that it allows us to connect people with people who care about their educations, but also that it provides new tools for learning.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There seem to be several promising new online education initiatives in my head right now: Coursera, Udacity, General Assembly, Metaculus.</li>
</ul><br><p>I also think that GiveWell has helped a bunch with #2 by spreading the word about the evidence for giving directly to recipients, and by bringing lots of people into the space of effective giving. We've focused mostly on health through the end of our career, but there are many other areas that we could potentially focus on that we aren't focusing on and that I think it would help to help with as well.</p><br><ol>
<li>Get people out from poverty traps</li>
