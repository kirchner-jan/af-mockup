Johnson's Blog on _Unqualified Reservations</p><br><p><em>[Epistemic status: This is a response to William Lane Craig's recent article, In Defense of Theology. It is not intended to be representative of all Christians who have responded to Craig's work. By Craig's own acknowledgement, this article may simply be another "well-meant effort to show Christians as good people."]</em></p><br><p>This week I attended a talk by William Lane Craig. Craig is the Director of the Christian Apologetics Research Institute and the founder of a number of other institutions, including the Institute for Creation Research. In the talk, he claimed that the Bible is "the most scientifically accurate book" in the world. He described various scientific evidence in the Bible and suggested that it supports the Christian religion.</p><br><p>Since I attended the talk, I've thought about the issue. Here are some of my thoughts.</p><br><p>I think the talk was well-intentioned, and it's definitely not his intention to write a "How To Get Away From A Christian Who Is Wrong About Everything." In this article, Craig discusses some of his critics' points while denying many of his own. For example, he addresses a creationist who argues the Bible's scientific accuracy in numerous places throughout the Bible by pointing out that the Bible's authorship is known to be ancient, while a book written by Francis Bacon that is as accurate in each place it claims was written before the Bible's authors could have known about it would be much less so. But, while the Bible does indeed contain references to the geology, astronomy, geophysics, astronomy, geography, etc. that exist today, it does not claim its authors were able to accurately anticipate these phenomena at the time they were written.</p><br><p>Craig also discusses a series of issues about the Bible's historicity, specifically, the fact that it contains claims about Biblical Israelites who lived between the exodus and the time of Solomon, but it is too early for such a group of persons-whose language and mannerisms are too distinct from Israelites to be Israelites-to have existed during the time of Solomon. However, both the archaeology of Israel and the historical record show that a population of Israelite immigrants was present in Israel before the time of Solomon-the book's claims about their population at the time of Solomon are simply incorrect.</p><br><p>Yet despite these examples, Craig never once uses the word "lies." He writes of the Hebrew Bible as if it's a collection of historical books, rather than a divine truth, and claims that we should trust the Bible's claims rather than the Bible's claims.</p><br><p>Craig is often criticized for defending the Bible without the understanding that, in so doing, he is defending a belief in divine revelation rather than rational inquiry. So it is understandable that Craig should be worried about his critics' attempts to deny that belief.</p><br><p>The one thing Craig doesn't discuss is whether the Bible's story of the exodus should be believed. In that regard, Craig's position is particularly noteworthy, for I agree with all of his statements in the talk and this article aside from his claim that the Bible "contains more than 300 instances showing [the Israelites] to be the Israelites of the modern day" and his claim that the historicity of the exodus is "unassailable" (Craig uses the same word repeatedly to mean "unassailable by any reasonable standard")</p><br><p>I have no problem accepting that the Bible itself does not provide the strongest evidence for the historicity of various religious claims in the Bible. This is not a criticism of the Bible as history, but rather it is a criticism of how it was presented in the talk. I believe that the Bible is likely to be the best historical work humans have produced, but that does not warrant its depiction as history in all cases. It is also possible that the Bible was written centuries after the events it describes. In either case, I believe that the evidence provided by it in those cases is weaker than the evidence provided by those events themselves, but stronger than the evidence provided simply by the book itself.</p><br><p>Craig's main response to the suggestion that one should believe the historicity of Biblical claims is that these "claims" are not claims, but "insights" into "the very nature of God's character and plan." If the Bible contained multiple claims about the nature of God's plan that are objectively and demonstrably wrong, the Bible\xe2\x80\x94which is the word of God and which cannot lie\xe2\x80\x94would have corrected the errors. However, there are only a few claims in the Bible that I'm aware of that I find to be wrong. And even in those cases, most people agree that those claims are mistaken.</p><br><p>It seems to me that the Bible\xe2\x80\x94which, again, cannot lie\xe2\x80\x94does not have enough information to justify us trusting its claims about the nature and character of God's plan, so it is the claims\xe2\x80\x94particularly when they are presented in the context of various Biblical claims that I don't believe-that we should make up our own minds.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, this was never Craig's point. Craig would have preferred to present the Bible as a book simply describing the nature and plan of God. That seems to have been his goal. That would have been much more palatable to Craig's critics than presenting him as an advocate of the Bible. But Craig was not able to do this in fear of appearing theistic (which he is at every point), and so he resorted to his alternative means of presenting the argument.</p><br><p>It is my view that Craig's criticism of his critics' attempts, as described above, to deny the historicity of Bible claims, is on balance correct. It would seem that a reasonable person should be able to see a common theme here: when a Christian is confronted with allegations that the Bible's history, the Bible's claims about the nature, plan, etc. of God are false, the Christian feels attacked by their critics' arguments, feels forced to defend the Bible by saying there's something about the Bible's general tone that warrants interpreting the Bible's history differently and defending its claims of historicity in various ways, and says there are a few claims here and there that the critics fail to acknowledge and to which, on reflection, the critic believes are mistaken. But even as it is claimed that, at least in those few cases the critics acknowledge are mistaken, the claim is also made that to deny the Bible's overall historicity\xe2\x80\x94particularly, the fact that most Christians would admit, at least on balance, that the Bible's overall historical claims are true\xe2\x80\x94would be to deny what is otherwise a core Christian belief.</p><br><p>I agree that such a view of the situation is wrong. I have argued before that, for the Christian, belief and unbelief must both be based on the Bible; that belief in the historicity of particular Biblical claims, even those that are currently considered mistaken, is justified by the Bible's other historical claims; and that denying the Bible's overall claim of historicity (at least in part) is to deny what is, at bottom, an epistemic belief in Christianity, rather than a moral one that affects action.</p><br><p>In my view, any view of the relationship between the Bible's overall claims of historicity and the nature and history of God that allows for the overall historicity of a book like the Bible to be denied based on the contents of individual claims within that book is mistaken. I agree that Craig's view that his critics' criticisms are mistaken\xe2\x80\x94even, ultimately, that Craig's view of his critics' views being mistaken is mistaken. But that is all the easier for Craig to defend if he frames the discussion in light of his goal of defending Christianity's claim to be a divine revelation rather than a book like the Gospel that, Craig would insist, if we read it in context, would have been understood and interpreted by its original audiences in the Bible as a divine revelation.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
