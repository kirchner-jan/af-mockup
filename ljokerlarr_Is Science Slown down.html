It is a good book, but it made the claim that Newtonian physics was right for all of science except for quantum mechanics. Deutsch asserts that quantum mechanics was an anomaly that needed to be explained. However, when we look at other fields that physicists believe should be governed by Newtonian physics, the claim is that they have worked just fine for several hundred years without quantum mechanics being able to overthrow Newtonian physics. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity, which was developed by his rivals who used Newtonian physics in all its forms except for the curvature of spacetime.</p><br><p>However, modern experimental physicists routinely disagree against all claims by the likes of David Deutsch on when it comes to the validity of Newtonian mechanics and Einstein's theories of relativity. For example, I recently read a summary of the results of the Gravity Probe Experiment in which it said that the claim that general relativity describes gravity has been ruled out at the level of 9 bits of experimental evidence. One can argue that this is for pragmatic reasons such as how much effort physicists are willing to spend to test this theory in the lab. However, another fact is not mentioned in the <em>Summary of the results of PGE and what they mean</em> that they ruled out Einstein's theory of gravity based on a theoretical calculation of the periapsis of Mercury and with that calculation they proved that the curvature of space is actually constant (in Einstein's formulation). It is the fact of the matter that relativity is more consistent with observation than Newtonian mechanics. Furthermore, to my knowledge the general consensus is that the results of the experimental probe experiments do not prove that Einstein's theory of relativistic gravity is more correct, but they do prove that it is not ruled out based on the facts they observed.</p><br><p>All of this led me to wonder whether there are other fields that are affected by the same problem that Newtonian mechanics has. Theories that are proposed and then experimentally found to either fail or to fail to hold within the limits tested is how we are able to determine whether or not the theories are in error or not. Given that we can't determine which theory is correct, it must be the case that at least some theory is correct by default.</p><br><p>One thing that might be true is that there is not really evidence as to whether relativity or Newton's physics is "correct". Maybe it does not really have a definitive answer to this question, like relativity. It just appears that it is correct. This leads me to assume that it is not really important that we can know the answer to this question by just looking at the empirical data. Instead it might depend on how advanced of an experiment or theory you are and how long it takes you to understand the problem. However, if the difference between relativity and Newton's physics comes down to how fast I can get the answer, then shouldn't science just speed along at the same rate regardless of the importance of the question? If that is the case, then I have no difficulty with people being able to "know" how to work with relativity and not Newton's physics. It is just that you cannot really know the answer by looking at the data about physics experiments.</p><br><p>Another thing that might be the case is the possibility that as we become smarter we can find the answer by studying physics experiments and science in general, that it just becomes a lot easier for humans and humans have better cognitive capacities than animals or machines that might be able to study physics experiments if they were equipped. I suspect that this is not the case though, because the problem of figuring out which is "correct" or maybe "true science" has a relatively small space of possible solutions, or at least not many different solutions that conflict with each other. For example, Newtonian mechanics and Relativity are both examples of this and even Einstein's relativity is somewhat like this. On the other hand, we have the question of how much computing power is necessary to calculate with the correct answer. Here it might be the case that the amount of computation required is just about the same (at least for the kind of problems that interest humans) and if more computing power is needed because the problem requires a lot of computation then it might just be easier to get the answer without doing the computations to get the answer.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
