Does anyone know of any books or articles that explore the mechanics and capabilities related to such manipulations. </p><br><p>Are there any people or groups out there (that one could trust) that might know of some research and analysis that explore the possibility of the use of such abilities for a variety of goals and purposes? What is the situation regarding the safety of such a technology? </p><br><p>(For those who know a bit of chemistry, note that the process is closely related to a phenomenon that I discovered when trying to learn about artificial organelles: the so-called "nanomachines of vision": http://​​en.wikipedia.org/​​wiki/​​Nanomachines_of_vision)</p><br><p>To summarize the story, some friends of hers were giving out some of these books in the workshop:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"Island" by David Eagleman, and</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>"Chaos Magick: The Art of Transformation.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>(the above are both on Amazon.com).</p><br><p>But the manipulations didn't happen in the books. They happened at a party where another person (who wasn't at the workshop) was manipulating the words. Apparently she (or one of her friends) was able to modify the words on the fly, for example, she could create a specific sequence of words that made two of my friend's friend, the person who was manipulating the book, fall on the ground without him (him and his friends) even noticing that anything unusual had happened. (The person herself said that she had the ability, not the people who she was talking to).</p><br><p>It was explained that a very important part of this manipulation was her ability to read the participants' non-verbal cues, which are based on how their brain processes the images from their eyes that come to a person's brain while he or she engages in various complex tasks that involve images (and sounds, etc.). It was also explained, however, that this manipulation couldn't be used to predict events in the participants' physical world, as the non-verbal parts of the brain is a separate part of the brain to the verbal part (in the person who was doing the manipulation).</p><br><p>I have also heard of people claiming to be able to generate images from words, but the manipulator in question didn't do this either. When asked whether she was aware of any books/​movies that explore this or other possible abilities, she said that she had read <em>The Matrix</em> and had no idea of what that was about or what the name "Morpheus" meant. </p><br><p>Anyway, what is with this whole thing? What is the risk of having non-verbal parts in our own brains, that can manipulate our verbal parts (and thus create a certain effect inside our brains)? Has this been discussed before? Even on Less Wrong? What is the general situation?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
