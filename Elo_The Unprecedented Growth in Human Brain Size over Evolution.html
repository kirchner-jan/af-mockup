We can do this by looking at how brain size relates to things:</p><br><p>Growth in brain size is related to:</p><br><ul>
<li>Intelligence/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bperformance</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Metabolic rate/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8befficiency</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Risk of mortality in general</li>
</ul><br><p>It is less clear, that if intelligence increases as human beings, then brain size should also increase. We could say that since evolution is a blind process. It is more likely that a certain percentage of the brain and body growth will also go toward increasing intelligence. To explain this we need two basic variables that influence the relationship.</p><br><p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong></p><br><p>Neuroplastic changes happen in the living human brain, and happen on every scale of time. How far they change brains is unknown, some people have speculated that it might be a key factor in how human brains do some things, others that brain size might be just too basic a unit of brain changes to be relevant. We also have some speculative evidence that changes may happen all the time, but it's unclear.</p><br><p>When we look at intelligence, we can hypothesise that intelligence is partly innate in a way. In the last 200,0000 years we have seen an evolution for intelligence that is not too far off from what we see in our brains.</p><br><p>When we try to think about the evolution of other kinds of changes, it seems more likely that if we see an evolution in intelligence, we'll also see an evolution in how our brains are structured to increase intelligence.  </p><br><p><strong>Growth Rate</strong></p><br><p>The second variable that influences the relationship between brain size and intelligence is the evolution of growth rate. </p><br><p>__Brain Size, Brain Age?<em>[1]</em></p><br><p>There is some evidence that an increased in brain size is correlated with a higher brain functioning at any given time because with more space in the brain you might be able to have more neural structures, and more neural structures might help when it comes to cognitive functioning. So, there is some evidence that that is happening. But we can't assume that it's a given that size will lead to increased functioning.  </p><br><p>There is some other evidence that there might be trade-offs involved in growth as well. A well studied example of this in our brains is an organism which has no neurons at birth growing into an adult brain with around 109 neurons. So if brain size is the driver of the increase in intelligence, and you see it growing, you might be pretty sure that there was something different going on with intelligence.    </p><br><p>If intelligence and growth rate are influenced by a different thing, how do you think we might be able to tease out causation in this kind of research. Brain size and intelligence seem to have this commonality of being based on growth rate.  </p><br><p>I have two main guesses around here about the relationship between how human intelligence is related to our brain size. Based on my understanding of the neuroscience in question, what I expect to be very common is that both of these things might be influenced by a different variable, and the more I look for this variable the more I predict that what I find might lead me away from this hypothesis, but if I can't find any reasons and look for them longer, then this is the hypothesis that I can't help but think of.   </p><br><p><strong>Brain Volume</strong></p><br><p>I can try to extrapolate what might be going to happen if I assume that evolution does have an impact of intelligence and growth rate and brain size. I can then apply that to Human brains and brain size and see what I can draw out of that.    Here is a picture I put together using what I'm finding here, but more research has to be done for me to actually know if I'm right.</p><br><p>Brain Size Graph for Humans and Gorillas.The only thing that this graph shows is a potential relationship between brain size, and intelligence. For the sake of argument I said that "Human intelligence" would be an increase in intelligence that is not as large, but is of that potential. There is a potential for brain and intelligence to interact in strange ways. It might not be that. The potential relationship is that intelligence causes more size. With more intelligence and a smaller human brain we can see the relationship between intelligence and brain size, it's just a bit weird to me that evolution would go so far to increase the intelligence but not the brain.    Maybe there are mechanisms in the human brain and human genes? And maybe there are mechanisms that the gorilla and human genomes might have different ones? Where Human genes might not be able to manipulate brain size or other parts of its development as easily?  </p><br><p>I don't know what is going on. I don't know where it's likely not to apply. There's good reason to believe this kind of thing to be true, but there's also a lot of uncertainty with that too, so you can't use it as an absolutely certain fact. I haven't studied enough to know if that's plausible or if it's not plausible enough to be worth the attention.  </p><br><p>It has been hypothesized in animal studies that a high concentration of neurons is a good thing in brains, and we do need more neurons and more neurons need more space so if intelligence causes more neurons this might make humans with higher intelligence have bigger brains and it might be a mechanism to help control development.  </p><br><p>This is not what I think will be true for humans because I think intelligence already causes neuron density (see Human vs Gorilla Brain) where I suspect that intelligence itself will not be able to increase neuron density because neurons are already dense. Where I'm less sure is that neurons and increased intelligence is a good factor for a given organism's development.    It has been observed that an increased neuron density is good for brain plasticity and function with the exception of things like epilepsy and autism where increased neuron density might be a root cause. The reason I am not 100% sure about this is because we haven't done enough research. There are a lot of unknowns and I don't know enough to make a correct observation about the mechanism.    We might also hypothesise that our brains have become adapted to use intelligence as an input and as an effect. That some aspects of the human brain like intelligence are actually adaptations for our environments, which would mean changing environment could change our brains. It makes sense to think that if there was a change in environment it would be adaptive so that might be why we see this behaviour. Or the reason we see this behaviour is that it is the way that our brains are adapted to the task ahead and what we see when we make this observation is exactly what you would see if we were seeing our brains adapting to that environment.    And that that's why we see the increased growth rate of intelligence. We do not get this increase in cognitive, human intelligence because of how our genome is adapted to work but because of how the environment is working. That's a very speculative way of thinking about this. But I will go with that for now, and I welcome any thoughts on where to go from this.    My guess from looking at this is that I don't think brain development is the driver of intelligence. And I think that a lot of what we see in terms of increased intelligence is due to change in our genes, and the environment interacting in weird ways with the genes, such as changes in how we communicate with each other which is really interesting. Because the human environment has changed over time.</p><br><p>Why I think this information about intelligence and growth rate is interesting to me is because the thing that this all leads me to is the same thing that I believe we can use to extrapolate a prediction about the brain size of an ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.</p><br><p><strong>Brain size in Human and Chimpanzee</strong></p><br><p>I'm not sure where to start with this question, I found this graph somewhere here, and I'm trying to replicate it, but this is from a book. I found the following description about growth rate from what I can remember. It says (quote around here):</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
