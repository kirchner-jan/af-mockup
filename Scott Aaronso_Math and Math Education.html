<li>So what kind of education system do we want to create for the students of the future?</li>
</ul><br><p>In the comments on my recent blog post "How would you create a superintelligence?", Vladimir_M posted his own answers. In this follow-up, I will go through his comments and the answers in my blog post in the reverse order, with links for context. The following are my "addendum" comments on the other top-level answers.</p><br><p><strong>In brief, the purpose of this post is to:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>"Correct" one of Vladimir_M's comments that, in my opinion, gave the impression that my idea might not be feasible; and</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Clarify my own idea, which is essentially to make all aspects of a math curriculum as mathematically accessible as possible.</li>
</ul><br><p>A brief historical perspective</p><br><p>The "old-school" math curriculum is aimed straight at the genius, and provides them with a technical understanding of advanced mathematics. A mathematical genius, in turn, may or may not have the resources to study the technical mathematics, or even have any interest in doing so. It was historically necessary to find some way for the mathematician to acquire the basic skills to move into the applied areas of math as a research engineer, a technician, or even a programmer; and then, in another generation, to be able to move into the cutting-edge of math and to pursue further technical learning of advanced mathematics. (By this I mean mathematics above the level of a basic undergraduate degree program.) If you go back far enough, even an average human being will have been able to _learn _the fundamentals of arithmetic long before we had the word school (and before there were school hours... yet we still have _school _hours now!) or before we had the concept of formal education.</p><br><p>What we think of as the "mathematician" in our society, and the "mathematical genius" that we regard with awe in the culture today, did not exist historically. A more recent development, of course, but a development nonetheless. In the last few centuries, we have changed significantly how mathematics is perceived and how mathematics is taught. The result has been a greatly expanded curriculum that is now available to all people, some even at the elementary level, though it's primarily restricted to developed nations and the "gifted" kids. In other words, the current math curriculum assumes that everybody knows how to deal with the mathematical "trick" of "finding the right definition/\xe2\x80\x8bnotation/\xe2\x80\x8bequivalent to what you're talking about". </p><br><p>In addition, the existing high school curriculum in developed nations is not geared toward the <em>undergraduate _math curriculum, it's geared toward the</em> elite _math curriculum, which is still largely the same today for the "young elite" in developed nations (though it is now widely accessible to all with high standards), and that leads to different constraints such as "no time", "no fun", and so on. (We could also take up this argument in the context of math education outside of developed nations, but my background is a bit too limited for that.) __A brief survey of early education (which in all the world is still dominated by the "genius/\xe2\x80\x8btalent" model) __from a _mathematical _perspective, compared with what we think of math education today, makes for fascinating reading.</p><br><p>The modern-day perspectiveSo what kind of education do we want to construct now, for the students of tomorrow, which (1) can be accessed at the undergraduate or lower level, (2) has a wide audience appeal, and (3) is not (yet) geared toward a particular "gifted" sub-population (i.e. the same elite sub-population as exists today)?</p><br><p>I'm a mathematician, so I'm obviously biased. But I think I have a pretty good idea, for those of you who may feel more "outside the fence" on this subject. </p><br><p>Let me start with some brief comments on the comments which were left so far on Vladimir_M's blog post:</p><br><ul>
<li>"The idea here is to take the idea of algebra, with the <em>undergraduate</em> math curriculum as the foundation, so that you have someone at the college level who has a solid technical understanding of <em>every</em> aspect, and who is up to speed with the new material. An idea similar to what Boolos &amp; Burgess advocated in the 1960s is the idea of an "algebra education". But since then algebra took a hit in popular circles because of the controversy over whether algebra is really about real numbers. "</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"It's good to be able to define new operators on an intuitively-understandable level, but the main problem is that what's taught in the undergraduate math curriculum is already so "algebraized" that you can't just take the new concept straight and start adding the new operators. What the math students need is a way to make the algebra they learn as "algebraically as accessible as possible". What we'd like is a way to take any of those ideas and, instead of finding the proper notation, to ask the student to come up with a notation that will explain at a glance what the new definitions mean. We could have an "operator school" where we teach all these operators at once, and then give them the algebra they need to define a new operator on their own. But in that case you need to make sure that these new operators are in the right ordering, that they're in the right algebra (so that you can combine them like normal operators), etc."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"The reason it's hard to learn a calculus before undergraduate math, in particular it's hard to "feel it's doing something". I think algebra is the best approach to that problem. I've used my own algebra textbook to learn calculus, and it worked beautifully! It definitely taught me the feeling "I could do it too, only it would be a much, much harder problem"."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"And it's not just algebra; it would probably be easier for the students to simply use something like an integrated-math system, like the one available today for the programming world. One nice feature is that you have lots of specialized math operators available, and, in principle, they can do any calculation available to a normal math operator, but they tend to involve some extra work/\xe2\x80\x8bnotation (e.g. the product rule). Here you have a "genius"; it would be trivial for him to quickly and easily construct the appropriate special operators, the right notation, etc."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Vladimir_M also wrote a reply to my comment where he expressed doubt that this was feasible, at least initially: "The task of <em>making a new language on top of the already-existing math language</em> is obviously feasible as long as we can build the language from the start, and the problem is finding a way to do that. Once we find that, all other technical difficulties follow automatically. If the problem is infeasible because it won't bring new ideas to the field quickly enough and/\xe2\x80\x8bor students won't grasp them, then we're back to the old problem: we need to find a way to "solve" this problem (or else, it's not a problem and we didn't need to solve it in the first place)." My reply to him, in turn, was: "I disagree with the assumption that a new language is necessary here. To my knowledge, there are lots of programs and mathematical tricks on the Internet which work, and you can explain them with existing math notation such as "x = 2 + x", etc. Just in elementary school a few years ago, I used these online tricks in many of my programming assignments, without ever using anything except English, even though I knew a bit of math. (And I'm sure most of you did too.) Similarly, "proving" any theorem is no more an issue than explaining the proof. (See: the idea of "proof sketching", the related "proof writing" phenomenon, etc; for a specific example of how the whole process works.) All we need is a list of theorems and a very simple programming language which supports the basic operations of math (as we already know in the first place) and "if you know the theorem you want, search this list for it", possibly in conjunction with some very simple visual aids. This sort of system could be run from an easily accessible website, and, as it's a purely web-based system (no CD or floppy drives needed), it could run even when the Internet is in a data-restricted area."</li>
