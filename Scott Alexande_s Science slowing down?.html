In case you didn't know, this may surprise you as it's a fact so widely publicized as to seem ridiculous. So while I wouldn't be surprised if it seemed like more than half the readers of this blog were taking it for granted, I'm here to tell you that this is a really big deal. A survey by the National Center for Educational Statistics found three in four undergraduates attended the top twenty-five US universities, and two thirds attended the top twenty. Only twenty percent made their freshman year at an in-state school. Of those, a fourth (two percent) went straight from their hometown school to the top twenty-two. I've heard other statistics suggesting the rate for elite universities may be even crazier.</p><br><p>Here's the top college ranking website, which says that students applying to Harvard go on the waitlist for three years in a row, for a total of twenty-six months. While you're waiting in the meantime, they invite you to their "college fair" where they give you the name of an "at-risk," meaning someone applying for admission who you would probably apply to if you were just applying to Harvard. One Harvard sophomore told NPR "They can say this all they want, but they have no business sending a kid like me to Harvard."</p><br><p>In case this isn't crazy enough, a Princeton professor recently surveyed about 150 other, "up-and-coming" elite universities in America, and found that many of them have the same problem of students applying for admission who would get spots if it were a lottery.</p><br><p>But what about those other elite universities who are <em>really</em> not in trouble?</p><br><p>First came the news that Yale, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania received full points on the most recent U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings. But many elite American colleges do worse. In the latest edition of their ranking, Princeton dropped one hundred places, Yale dropped twenty-two, and Brown dropped eight. Stanford dropped fifty spots, Harvard lost over seventy-five (and the Harvard Crimson reports that this may have actually contributed to Harvard's high ranking on the latest U.S.N.W.R. ranking). Of course, this is a little hard to track from this distance, but a commenter on one link points out:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Stanford and Brown, for example, lost thirty and forty places respectively, which was also around the time that the universities were giving massive tuition increases. But now that they have been so heavily punished, these universities still outrank Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and the old Princeton, Brown, and Harvard, respectively...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This sounds a lot like the sort of thing you say if you're a reporter writing a story with a shocking-sounding headline, but that's what <em>The Nation</em> said. Yale and Princeton, despite losing fifty and twenty-two places, just outrank Stanford and Brown right now. But they used to be in the top ten when it came to America's elite colleges. Why? They just haven't gotten the "money"; this is a euphemism for "we're spending more."</p><br><p>"It is important to recognize that these places are still spending a lot of money, and that money they're spending on admissions and development isn't enough," says Harvard admissions Dean of Admission Thomas F. Rhodes, speaking to reporters. "These places are still spending some money, and they're not spending that money well enough to keep up. You know what colleges really struggle with in many states, not just this state, but across the country, is that these places need more money, but it's hard for them to raise because of the cost disease."</p><br><p>It's not just America, either. As a report by the OECD notes:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The OECD's Report on Higher Education notes that "for all its spending, the UK and Canada lack economies of scale in education that might be possible for the US.... In contrast, in countries where they do scale, such as Spain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, education spend is increasing rapidly and could at least partly be devoted to basic skills, such as mathematics, language and science." One of the main problems of English universities, it goes on, is the "vast variation in quality among their degrees and majors," caused by the relative lack of "the best universities being highly oversubscribed....[Y]our university education in England can depend on whether it's in Oxford or Cambridge, London or Edinburgh."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>And the report goes on to say that in the other countries of the top quartile, "education at all levels is becoming more equal." This does not seem to be the case in the USA. It seems that the top universities are doing better, but the middle ones are stagnating.</p><br><p>In the UK, the OECD suggests the main way to boost growth is "for countries to invest in basic human capital," by making early childhood education free (not all universities do this). That sounds sensible, but it might be a little premature to have such recommendations to make in the US if we aren't even doing basic human capital investment.</p><br><p>To find out, I headed to Boston to visit MIT. MIT has long been America's elite technical university, consistently at the top among universities with very high percentages of students getting jobs in high-paying technical fields such as biotech and nanotech. As it happens, Harvard is also an elite technical university. But MIT is now the leading technical university again.</p><br><p>MIT faculty, especially during my visit, seemed surprised by the change (one of them gave a talk on what he calls the "MIT bias.") I asked them what had happened, and what might happen next. I got replies like this:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>It's not that MIT is an outlier, but instead that MIT is just a very unusual place to be in, in a context of more standard elite technical university rankings. If you zoom a bit out of the universities in the rankings, MIT is still a good quality institution (for instance, it's been ranked in the top 10 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, it's in the top 10 in the National Research Council's "PQRP" rankings...). But it's now ranked in the top 5, which means MIT has to do something different to get to the top of the rankings than you have to do if you're at a top 10 college like Stanford or Princeton.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>And:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Right now, the biggest issue that's really being attacked is admissions. So we have to do many things differently from what we've done in the past. There are many admissions offices, there's been some movement of different offices into new buildings. There are different admissions programs. There's the one where it's entirely online, where you don't have to go to an office, so you're not in the office and you're not going to see the principal, which puts you at the mercy of the interviewer, who can decide "what's the best thing to ask about?" and things like that. This is a way the admissions office's changed, and I think will continue to change and has already continued to change.</p>
