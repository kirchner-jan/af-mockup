<p><strong>You:</strong> Well, I don't like being called on first-name basis with people. </p>
</blockquote><br><p><strong>Me:</strong> Okay. So, can you tell me why you don't like it?</p><br><p><strong>You:</strong> Well...</p><br><p>So, a few different things could happen.</p><br><p>You could stop answering my questions and make me feel bad for asking. This would go on all day and I'd feel a lot of frustration and annoyance.</p><br><p>You could change your mind and give a reasoned answer. This probably involves a lot of words and I have to actually hear it. There's some loss of face here because I don't have to take the other person seriously any more. I can just be like, "Yeah, I don't care that much why", and then we both feel bad.</p><br><p>Or you could make a mistake and tell me an obvious wrong answer that would have gone with my other options. Now I feel like I've been lied to and now I'm stuck with the impression that this is a thing people do. </p><br><p>II.</p><br><p>If you are in a public space and someone says the N-word to you, what do you think is going to happen?</p><br><blockquote>
<p><strong>(You)</strong>: I'm going to be pretty angry. </p>
</blockquote><br><p>At this point, I'd also probably say "I'm going to be really angry". There's a few possible answers to this. I could yell. I could do other angry-style things to the person. I could yell and do other things at the same time.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The bystander: <em>Oh, are you going to be angry?</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p><em>You:</em> &lt;-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to have an angry-off with the person. Yeah. </p><br><p>(If you go with the bystander's framing, my first reaction is <em>Why are you being polite?</em> followed by <em>Hm, why did you feel the need to call this person out for not being civil?</em> Then I might follow up by <em>Do you really feel this strongly about being insulted? Are you willing to hurt a person to try and protect your pride?</em> which I think is a pretty reasonable next question.)</p><br><p><strong>(You)</strong> <em>And are you really angry?</em> </p><br><p><em>Me:    I am angry.</em></p><br><p><em>(You)__ I don't think so, but would you like me to help you be angry?</em></p><br><p>If I had some kind of a magic wand that could make someone angry without them having to put in any effort, I think I would be pretty sure that I had not used it. If I could get to be mad by snapping my fingers, then I had definitely snapped my fingers.</p><br><p>III.</p><br><p>A friend of mine had recently made a comment on social media that was something along the lines of "I am so sick of [insert political view] people trying to use me as a punching bag whenever they feel threatened or cornered." My friend was right to make this remark, yet even she might find that this reaction is a bit over-the-top. As far as I can tell, there are times when one should be a bit blunt about things; those times are often times where you know exactly what you are getting into, and everyone involved can just decide what they want out of the whole thing. But when the stakes are potentially quite high, I think it can be wise to tread carefully.</p><br><p>But, what if I want you to be angry? </p><br><p>IV.</p><br><p>I guess one of the best ways to get somebody to be angry is by talking about a personal problem that they are experiencing. Or a personal past incident from several years ago to get their reactions. </p><br><blockquote>
<p>(You) <em>So, I'm really sick of these political pundits getting under my skin whenever I'm not doing anything wrong.</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p><em>Me </em>(thinking to myself) <em>Well, if you were really concerned about that, you would have said it when they had been getting to you first.</em></p><br><p><em>(You)__ You didn't like when they were getting to me first.</em></p><br><p><em>I</em> <em>(thinking to myself) _Well, you are clearly the one who needs to change about being easily put off by politeness. If politics and the media get under your skin, there are a lot of ways that I can help you be less affected by it.</em></p><br><p>I'm a bit confused about how my friend's comments actually went over \xe2\x80\x93 I don't think they were as harsh as the comment above. They did have that tone, and a comment like "I'm so sick of these political partisans trying to use me to be a punching-bag whenever I'm not do anything wrong" might do sound a bit more biting. But I think that she's still making a mistake by telling this kind of story \xe2\x80\x93 by starting a discussion off on an uncomfortable topic \xe2\x80\x93 without first doing her best to make sure that her audience understands the whole point she's trying to make. Starting the conversation with the goal of finding ways to get her audience to think and feel a certain way might not be the best way to do that.</p><br><p>The most obvious way this might go wrong is as just the things you said above \xe2\x80\x93 being rude, or overly-harsh. My guess is that it's easier to get somebody to feel a certain way if you start by describing a real life experience.</p><br><p>But I think that if you are going to start off that way, there's another way that you can go wrong too. </p><br><p>V.</p><br><p>If I tell you about an experience that really frustrated me \xe2\x80\x93 an experience that I'd described it as "getting into it" \xe2\x80\x93 then you are probably going to think that I was having fun. You are probably going to interpret that story as a call-out to people who are in my position \xe2\x80\x93 to people who go through things. You are going to see <em>That's why this happened to you, I'm calling people out who do that</em>. And in some ways you might be right. It could well have happened to me and I would have been mad. On the other hand it is a very personal story. Why does that matter? What do I know about this other person which can give me information that will help me determine whether I agree with my own story?</p><br><p>I believe that you can often tell whether you want someone to be mad or not by asking yourself a question that's going to take some thinking, "Will they be able to understand the full story, or would I need to simplify it?" \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. am I willing to give the person enough detail to reconstruct my emotions in the situation? Am I going to be able to describe how I felt in as clear and unambiguous a way as I could, given that it was an emotionally charged issue, or is this the kind of situation where I need to provide an example of the whole situation? And if the latter, what makes a story of somebody being rude sufficiently unpleasant to justify me spending this much time telling it? I would also be happy to have a conversation in private where we discuss how best to present my situation in a way that makes me and other people involved feel understood, without having to risk our initial impression of each other.</p><br><p>I think that the underlying issue here stems from whether or not we believe that somebody's story can and should be used against them in a public place. Let's say I have just explained to you all the reasons why the words that somebody said shouldn't have bothered me, and let me ask you why this comment was disrespectful. I want you to tell me that as well.</p><br><p>VI.</p><br><p>One of my personal pet peeves is arguments that happen to be political disputes. Most of the time they are not about the most right answer or a point of view on a particular important issue, but rather a person feels threatened right here right at this moment, and I feel attacked somehow by being being told I'm not allowed to feel something (or that I'm being asked to do something for another person) because it might offend somebody who didn't want their attention drawn to that particular thing. And I've had some issues with this when it happens to me, and I'm not usually sure that I know how to solve the overall issue, or how likely it is that I would even succeed at figuring it out. I think that if I can learn to be less affected by that, I can become less affected by the kinds of things that are discussed regularly in the first place. </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
