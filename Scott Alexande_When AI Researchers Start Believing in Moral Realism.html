And yet I think I've never met a fellow LWian.</p><br><p>I was recently reminded of the phenomenon of belief in moral realism by a discussion over gender and evolution, which prompted me to write this post. Since my current post isn't very good yet, here's a link to someone who's going further, by explaining belief in moral realism.</p><br><p>The debate over human genetic engineering hinges on what will happen if human beings can manipulate genes to get a baby born without parts of a parent's genetic code for things like intelligence and conscientiousness, for example. If we cannot, how will all these advantages be balanced against each other?</p><br><p>The evolutionary answer to this question is that we'll all be exactly the same, but there will be no differences in brain or behaviour caused by the changes in our genes. So we'd all have exactly the same intelligence and conscientiousness as everyone else, without all the things that make people _good _behaviourists or intellectuals such as empathy, altruism, and things like that.</p><br><p>The pro-human-engineering side of the debate argues that we might not have the exact same things genetically, which would lead to advantages and disadvantages. So by manipulating genes, we might cause lots of advantages to outweigh other disadvantages, or by eliminating our weaknesses we might make ourselves more efficient fighters, for example, even if the changes were only slight.This post explains why many people consider the former side more likely, and the latter position extremely speculative. It explains how and why both sides have gotten so bogged down in a debate that is mostly unanswerable.</p><br><p>I'm sure there's more than one reason for this, but I'm going to quote from the section on the evolutionary perspective because it's clear and short.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>To see this, we need to introduce some terminology. It will be helpful to know what some of these terms mean, so I explain the basic concepts here.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>One of these terms will be "allele." These are the copies of genes that make up, e.g. the two alleles of a pair of recessive genes. The frequency of an allele is the number of people with it, divided by all the people.</p><br><p>Another term is "allelic load." It's the sum of the allele frequencies of all the alleles present in one person. This can be higher or lower than average.</p><br><p>This is how many genes contribute to the allelic load of any particular characteristic that's more common than average. Some things will have higher loads for average characteristics, others for non-average characteristics. Most non-average characteristics will have allelic loads that's about average for their distribution in the human genetic population.</p><br><p>Note that I haven't defined "average" yet. "Average" simply refers to the range we get from many people. What does "range" mean? If a characteristic is normally distributed in the human population, all values in the distribution have approximately the same value of variation. However, if it's not, there will be more variance. That's the range around the mean. Sometimes a characteristic will have _more _average value than average, and sometimes it will have _less _average value than the average. "Range" is just one measure of this. There are others.</p><br><p>So we can use these terms to look at how important gene effects are to individual differences in general population characteristics. There are two ways to calculate this:</p><br><p><em>How important are alleles to the overall variance of a given population?</em> This is a measure of importance called "heritability." It's pretty important, more than half the total variance in nearly every population. It's why personality is such a big factor in how humans differ from each other. However, this is _not _the same as the importance of genes _in any particular person _to that person's average characteristic.</p><br><p><em>How much variance in that characteristic is explained by genes?</em> This is called "the genetic factor."</p><br><p>Genetic factors explain a much larger fraction of the variance than heritabilities do. People with higher intelligence, for example, have higher genetic factors, and higher genetic factors mean higher heritabilities.</p><br><p>But what would count as a "high" heritability in any individual? Sheitabilities are measured against the entire human population, so it would presumably average out. So how can we calculate a "high" genetic factor in any individual?</p><br><p>To do this, let's say you have a bunch of different traits that do not correlate with each other. One way to do this is to make a correlation matrix of the traits. Another way in this situation is to use a regression. These ways should yield approximately the same answer; you can probably guess how it works. So let's say we're using a regression. Since sheitabilities are measured with respect to the _entire _human population, the average of all the traits would cancel out the individual variance. That means our results should be similar to the results from the correlation matrix.</p><br><p>We find that some traits that average out to be more correlated the average trait than other traits. So for every individual who has higher average trait, there's another individual with lower average trait. Some of these traits are quite correlated with each other across individuals; intelligence is one example, and verbal skills another. So our genetic factors in these traits _also _average out across all individuals.</p><br><p>So how many are higher? I said that an average trait has a lower genetic factor than an average. Well, that could mean that, on average, an average trait has lower heritabilities than average, or that average traits have lower genetic factors than average. It turns out that average traits generally have lower heritabilities, and so do average traits have lower individual differences in them. Therefore, average traits generally have higher heritabilities, individual traits generally have lower genetic factors.</p><br><p>This means if we have a correlation matrix of trait variation with the traits and correlation matrixes of trait averages versus trait frequencies, we end up with almost exactly the same correlation coefficient for the correlation matrix between traits versus trait frequencies and trait averages versus trait averages. This is the heritability of average traits. Thus, the higher this coefficient is, the higher is the heritability for average traits, the lower is the genetic factor for these traits, and the higher the genetic factor for this average trait.</p><br><p>Note two things from this. The first is that the results of the correlation matrix are more robust against variations in what traits you look at. Suppose you take only the height and verbal talent statistics. You'll still end up with a correlation matrix of average height versus average speech intelligence versus average intelligence versus average height. When I say "the results of the correlation are robust", that basically means that we can fix which traits we look at without changing the results. So in the case of the height vs average speech intelligence correlation matrices, a correlation coefficient is independent of what you choose to look at.</p><br><p>The other important thing to note is that even if some traits do have higher heritandicies than average, that doesn't automatically reflect higher genetic factors. Intelligence, for instance, is a highly heritable characteristic, but the average person's verbal intelligence might not be very heritable. If the average person scores a 5, the highest individual verbal scores might only average out to 4.2.So, the average person's high intelligence, that makes her verbal skills much better than average, might not make her verbal intelligence much better than average while making intelligence _per se _much better than average. And vice-versa, the average person with average verbal skills might have just a little bit of verbal genius whereas the average person's intellectual traits might be extremely heritable.</p><br><p>To look at IQ and conscientiousness, we can use the same method. Some studies find higher heritandicity for conscientiousness, and others find a higher genetic factor. A friend of mine used to wonder whether a high IQ was required to be a good scientist and the answer appears to be yes. So for those genes that code for intelligence, intelligence _is _a pretty important requirement for being a scientist.On the other hand, conscientiousness might not be. If you want a scientist who isn't conscientious, some smart people will probably be able to avoid any major personality disorders and just not procrastinate.</p><br><p>What do these studies actually find? A study by Stephen Hsu finds that the personality traits related to intelligence and conscientiousness score about 0.9 out of 10 on the g-factor \xe2\x80\x93 about as much as any other personality trait. Intelligence correlates 0.85 with conscientiousness, and conscientiousness correlates with 0.7 intelligence. A similar study by Paul Fussell and Peter Gumm found 0.7 correlations between social desirability and IQ, but the highest correlations with conscientiousness were 0.5. Another study finds that conscientiousness and intelligence are both correlated around 0.4 with each other.A study by Stephen H. Andreas found that there was no correlation between IQ, conscientiousness, or extraversion and risk of psychosis.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
