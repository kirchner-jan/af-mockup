<li>The world is full of people talking about the future.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Most conversations seem like they might be important or interesting, and they're in fact important or interesting. Other conversations seem pointless or even harmful.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>New technologies tend to be more exciting and new than previous technologies.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>New ideas are more exciting and new.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It will also be easier to understand the new technologies, since, in the past, they were unfamiliar and hard to understand.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Everything changes fast!</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What can you do about it?</li>
</ul><br><p>I'm interested both in the process of becoming excited about a future technology and the process of learning about the new future technology. In the past I'd thought about becoming excited about future technologies, and learning about them, in separate posts. Over the last few months I decided to combine them into one post, a bit like combining learning about history into a history post. I'd planned to write a new post about each technology, but in the end there's just one post, because there's really only one point of a new technology and one of becoming excited about the future. (If you think about what the most exciting things <em>are</em>, they're probably not things that happened 100 years ago!) So this is the first post of four. I'd have liked to have them correspond to four different technologies, but I couldn't think of good ways to do that. As I said, I think the point is to learn about future technologies, not to learn about the past technologies.</p><br><p>The world is full of </p><br><p>The New Dawn is the process by which we find out what the world is going to be like.</p><br><p>I'd like to start with a fairly typical example;</p><br><blockquote>
<p>_I feel like there's a lot of work to do, and a lot of other people have noticed that there's a lot to do. I've been reading some books lately about all these other people feeling that they have a lot to do, and what they're doing about other people, and I think I've come to a decent conclusion about who they are that they're kinda working together, and they're kinda doing some stuff, like: _</p>
</blockquote><br><ul>
<li><strong>(1) More importantly, if you read Tyler Cowen's books, he says something that's kind of like: We haven't had a big economic hit, so if you're like me, I'm still making a lot of money. So if you're like him, you're the kind of person who'll be doing important work even if you can still get along in life.</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>(2) If other people are in the category of "we're doing important work, except there's this big economic hit going on", we shouldn't be worried. If you're worried about that category, you must be more afraid of (1) or (2) than about the general economic situation.</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(3) In the future, (1), (2) and (3) may give more weight to the question "will this work be important?" than "will this work bring big benefits?".__</li>
</ul><br><p>And there's not one of a bunch of ways they can talk about the future. There's just a generic, boring talk of how interesting things are, and a generic "hey, there's another thing to do".</p><br><p>Maybe I'm just having trouble finding good examples because there isn't a lot that's new.</p><br><p>There's some stuff where new ideas or technologies are discussed, but the problem there is I don't think there's an established term for talking about important and exciting ideas that haven't been invented.</p><br><p>Let me give a few examples. I'll use a few of my own work ideas, in which I'm trying to push into the future. Some ideas I'm more excited about than others, or more excited about the process than the final results.</p><br><p><strong>(1) Learning algorithms for deep networks</strong></p><br><p>The goal of this idea is to do an end to end evaluation of a candidate learning algorithm on some system on some training data and then do a backpropagation of errors through all the layers and then evaluate each layer's effect on convergence. You do a layer by layer evaluation, or maybe by batching. If you're excited about this idea, it's partially because you think the algorithm is exciting and partially because you don't think the algorithm will work, or at least not reliably. If you're more excited about the future result, it's because you think the idea will work.</p><br><p><strong>(2) Learning what people will want to pay for</strong></p><br><p>I was excited about this idea because I'm very fond of this idea. I was also excited about this idea partly because I thought the algorithm would work, or at the very least would work more reliably and cheaply than most algorithms on which I'd tried to learn what people want to pay for. If the idea is being implemented successfully, I might get excited about the potential economic benefits. I might be excited for the same reason I was excited about (1), because I think the algorithm might work, or because I think that it might make a big difference. I might be more excited about the end-result of this project if I thought it would be more important than the other projects I'm working on.</p><br><p><strong>(3) An algorithm for finding good actions</strong></p><br><p>It's hard to give examples of an algorithm being useful in practice. But I know it's hard because people are making serious efforts to solve it. The idea of an algorithm for finding good behaviors, in a world without human experts or clear human preferences, doesn't seem so crazy. But I was excited about the idea mostly because it feels nice that we might be able to find the good actions of an AI in the real world. I might be a bit more excited about the idea if it became apparent that we could improve AI safety and security. The idea might also be exciting to others partly because it seems relevant to their work. I also like this idea partly because it feels like progress in the project gives me insight I'd never have had or could never evaluate otherwise.</p><br><p>There's not a lot of detail in these three ideas. It's a little bit hard to be exciting about a project because it's hard to give a high level description.</p><br><p>I think there's a lot more potential here, and I think there are probably ideas we could talk about, especially in the future, that are that exciting. There's probably reasons a lot of people might be excited about having ideas or projects in this vein, and reasons that if someone did them that you might be excited about it, or might wish you'd heard about it.</p><br><p>I've already started writing a post about ways in which the future can be exciting, and am going to add examples like this one. I'd be excited about future posts but haven't done anything about making them, although I plan to make a post on this in the future.</p><br><p>Maybe something about this post is exciting and maybe it's not exciting to others. That's fine. I've never found one idea exciting or interesting until I started writing about it.</p><br><p>On the other hand, maybe everyone already thinks the idea is exciting and has reasons for thinking it might be exciting or interesting.</p><br><p>If that were the case, I'd say this idea is exciting to you, or it's exciting or interesting to think about. (It doesn't surprise me, it's just the standard view.) In general I think this idea has about a 1:3 chances of exciting or interesting you, and a 3:1 chance of being exciting or interesting to someone else.</p><br><p>I still think the argument is mostly about learning algorithms for deep networks. We still have lots of problems with deep networks, and no great algorithm for finding good behavior without having to simulate it.</p><br><p>There's a lot more I could say about this. I think it's a decent example of something that might be exciting. I think there's a bunch of common features. The list isn't exhaustive. There's lots more I could say, but that doesn't mean I think it's exciting.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
