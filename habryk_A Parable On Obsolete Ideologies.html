</ul><br><p>(As always, please keep in mind that the current social environment, and the person writing, have a huge impact on my decisions, and it's quite possible that some things here will go down very wrong, especially if others have a significant impact on things)</p><br><p>1.</p><br><p>There was a large group of smart nerds in a space called "Internet". A lot of them were in high school, but many of them had PhDs, masters, and professional careers. There were a lot of fields of study they were interested in, from math to literature. </p><br><p>Almost all of them were men.</p><br><p>And in the beginning, people thought there was nothing wrong with this, and that Internet meant they could now get access to all of this great content. They wrote a lot of great articles, but there was some growing tension. </p><br><p>There were a lot of complaints from the women in the space called "Internet", that they weren't getting attention, and weren't feeling listened to and respected. Some of the men argued back by saying "Look, you're complaining that the Internet is all for men, but then when other groups of weird nerds say the same thing, you accuse them of being men-grabbing jerks." </p><br><p>Eventually, the women started doing their own thing online to address the issue from their end, and the men said "Ok, great, now let's start our own thing".</p><br><p>Shortly after, there was open warfare between the male and female nerds. After years, people finally decided enough was enough and banned a bunch of the men who were doing the most damage. And some years later, a different group of men reformed, saying "Look, we're going to rebrand things, to make sure that no one ever tries to create a group for straight men again in internet. We want to make sure that we get the respect we deserve."</p><br><p>Some years later, the men in the new group started fighting a whole new movement called "sex cult".  Some of the new men started questioning that movement, seeing it as a cult of control, and being extremely skeptical of the new movement's claims that its new rituals that made men "god" were going to make everyone happier and more fulfilled and enlightened. </p><br><p>Eventually, some of the newer men started turning up the volume to fight back, creating other new groups and movements that all started from their initial idea of fighting against the men who did bad things with the new cult, which was now causing major amounts of harm and unhappiness to women, transpeople, and other groups that people didn't like.</p><br><p>Which all culminated in a movement called "Anti-Cult".  Most people who joined it left after seeing clearly that the cult was the bad guys, and being extremely confused about why so many smart people were staying in the cult-related groups that kept saying the same awful things.</p><br><p>Eventually, some people were having enough, saying "Look here, I think some of these groups are actively doing wrong by other groups, and some of these groups actively do right by other groups. But overall, it is important to find a way to have a non-toxic space where people can actually talk and relate freely without it being polluted by bad ideas." </p><br><p>These people became the core of the new movement "Agency", and the movement as a whole was renamed "Agency Movement".</p><br><p>2.</p><br><p>Some months later, a group called "Amen" joined Agency Movement, with plans to start an online community specifically for cis and trans women (Agency was, at this point, pretty gender non-binary). </p><br><p>Everyone was really excited to see how this new movement would work out, because there weren't any real spaces for cis women, and because it would provide a better starting point for trans women to get to a new community. </p><br><p>But Agency Movement quickly ran into similar issues with the men in Internet and Sex Cult. Some people were actively trying to prevent any discussions of sex politics, while people in Amen insisted that some questions were important, such as whether men or women were responsible mostly for violence towards men, and whether trans women were the same as women. After a bunch of arguments about the real meanings of words and all the usual Internet arguments, the admins decided they weren't interested in policing language or culture politics to the degree that the new culture wars were about, so it seemed like maybe they needed to have the same culture wars.</p><br><p>Eventually, more people grew frustrated with the new culture wars going on, and said "If people can't work out their culture stuff in private channels, then why don't people who want to keep having culture wars have their own space somewhere else." </p><br><p>The admins weren't sure how to handle this, but after a bunch of discussion decided that the most neutral thing they could do would be to make Agency the new owner of the internet, and make Amen an independent forum.</p><br><p>Some people were really excited by that proposal, and most existing commenters from all the previous culture wars came to agree, saying "This would be a great compromise!". Some people were really disappointed by that compromise, saying "Hey, these culture wars are important! How can people have different cultures, if they're all made of the same atoms?". And there were other people who were upset at those people for making this compromise, saying "Look! I don't like the culture war either!! But if that's how everyone is feeling, and if that's all the culture has, then I don't see how this can be a neutral space anymore.")</p><br><p>And more people just said "This was never neutral."</p><br><p>3.</p><br><p>Eventually, the admins of both of those forums got together. They explained to the other admins that they were getting together because they thought this idea of "Agency" was really worth pursuing further, but in no way meant to interfere with either forum. And they agreed on several principles to prevent any future problems:</p><br><ul>
<li>They would let anyone use any language and call any group that they created "Agency". </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>No posts or actions from any forum would be taken to undermine the goals of the forum itself or the goals of the admins. </li>
</ul><br><p>So people started posting "Hey, you know, I keep hearing bad things about this group that some of us created, and I wanted to check if you think I should start a space for them where they all can post and have the same culture. Please?" And they said "That was great, thanks, keep doing that, you don't have to do anything about it or explain it to anyone because you're the new owners and you have jurisdiction over the entire internet and you don't have a reason to censor this." And the posts kept happening. Eventually both admins started to get worried and felt that maybe they were being too nice to the new folks to make that work out, so they started trying to limit the amount of interaction and participation they allowed, to see if it would solve the problem.</p><br><p>But this only made things even more confusing. "Hey, so, I heard you guys don't want to censor the people trying to create a group to support my friends' work being published on Agency. But I wanted to let you know that I feel really important that my friends are able to talk freely, so here's an awesome website I made where they can talk about those ideas with me."  "Well, actually, I heard a bunch of you guys think my friends ideas are dangerous, and that's important to me so I'm going to set up this super paranoid security and make sure it's never opened, and not let you discuss things that I think you may be trying to destroy my friends' reputation."  </p><br><p>At some point, a few other people started seeing things differently, and posting that they were trying to do the same thing as the admin of Agency, but much more strongly. "Hey, I like these friends who are trying to create their own space for talking about some ideas. But I think their work is important and I feel really sad that it's been banned from Agency. Here's this new website I'm launching that will let Agency supporters post to it and talk about this work, but it won't let anyone post anything that says the ideas are dangerous or negative, so they can all be free and open from here without worrying, and without interfering with Agency or anyone else's spaces, and it'll be the place for anyone who talks about these ideas, and for anyone who wants to join our new community of friends to try to figure out what is going on and fight together." </p><br><p>"Well, actually, while you guys are posting this nice polite nonsense, I think something important is going on here, and while I think it should be allowed to continue, I'll ban some people if you don't think that this is important. Which part of the first paragraph am I missing? I didn't say anything about wanting to censor anything you said, just that I thought something important might be going on here." </p><br><p>The people who were against the policy also said that banning them would do them great harm, while the admins who supported it said "No harm done! Actually, we think the culture we are setting up has historically been very good for the people in that space. And we're being careful not to upset them too much, but we plan on moving things to a state where they'll be safe and able to do that activity as long as they want.".</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
