Also, on the subject of this sort of thing, the opposite of a lie is not just middling truth\xe2\x80\x94it is a lie as well.]  _</p><br><p><strong>Eliezer Yudkowsky writes:</strong></p><br><blockquote></blockquote><br><p>The first step in becoming a rationalist is to realize that you were already one all along.</p><br><p>This sounds a whole lot better than the standard advice from, say, religion, which is:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>If you confess and repent and do what is right maybe God will forgive you.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>But the first step in becoming an economist is to realize you were already one with no prompting. So this is one of the most valuable things I have ever gained from Less Wrong.</p><br><p>For those of you who weren't around for all this great economic literacy stuff, here's a list of famous economists who could have avoided their mistakes: Adam Smith, Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, John von Neumann, E A Wilson, Alan Gibbard, Gary Becker, Peter Singer, and Milton Friedman.</p><br><p>The first lesson we can take from all this is that there are three kinds of economists: smart, dumb, and economists for the general public.</p><br><p>The smart economists are those who can predict what will happen if we go ahead and print lots and lots of government bonds. The dumb economists are those who say bonds will never be a good idea. Their opinions can be dismissed summarily: They have never been economists. The economists for the general population can be dismissed summari</p><br><p>arily: They have forgotten a couple of economics 101. These will be the kind of people who can take a simple mathematical truth\xe2\x80\x94that more consumption means less efficiency, for example\xe2\x80\x94and make it sound like a weird esoteric theory. The economics of that particular example: "Consumption in itself (i.e. people getting new shoes they don't need) is good for the economy; but we shouldn't pay attention to productivity improvements when people just buy that sort of stuff because they want it."  The economists for the public will usually be smart enough to see right away who's telling the truth and who's lying.</p><br><p>And now, the economist for the general public:</p><br><p>John Maynard Keynes, a smart economist:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>You can learn something about a country by studying the annual accounts of the National Bank of that country\xe2\x80\x94especially by comparing the size of the balance at successive periods. But you can learn a good deal more by the way these accounts are made up, and by studying the changes that have taken place in the Bank's Charter over the years.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>George Bernard Shaw, a dumb economist:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>He believes that the main problem of the 20th century has been the growing gulf between the haves and the have-nots. He blames it on those who profited from slavery and who got all the land and all the wealth at the expense of those who didn't own even a fraction of the capital, and to be fair the people who did own capital did have the majority of the riches on this planet except for a very small percentage that was taken away and given to the have-not's. He tells us that this is unfair to the have-nott's and a terrible thing that we don't have a land inheritance to start off with, a piece of the pie.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Or:</p><br><p>Alan Greenspan.</p><br><p>Or: Robin Hanson.</p><br><p>Or even: Peter Thiel.</p><br><p>Or for that matter: Scott Sumner.</p><br><p>This is why so many economists are smart enough to be dangerous, and in a certain sense we're just lucky we have smart ones looking out for us.</p><br><p>The other lesson we can take away from this is that economists are not very good at spotting other smart economists. That makes economists pretty easy targets: All you have to do is listen a few seconds to their arguments, and you'll realize they're wrong.</p><br><p>But we need more economists we can trust. For example:</p><br><p>Ben Bernanke.</p><br><p>Paul Krugman.</p><br><p>James Buchanan</p><br><p>Gary Becker</p><br><p>...and of course:</p><br><p>Robin Hanson</p><br><p>And, more commonly,</p><br><p>Eliezer Yuddkowsky</p><br><p>This post will be largely about Yudkowsky, which might give the impression that I like him better than most others. Not true.</p><br><p>I've read most of his work, and I think he's one of the worst offenders on the list above. And we've already seen a piece of evidence for that.</p><br><p>Yudkowsky has lots of smart ideas. Some of them are pretty good. But when I take Yudkowsky and ask myself "Is this person one of the smartest people ever?", the answer is a very clear yes. But "Does this person have a good understanding of economics?" the answer is yes. But "Suppose I took the smartest economist in history, and told him about as many of Yudkowsky's smart ideas as he wanted, and he asked whether Yudkowsky had the superior insight." Yudkowsky is very smart, but "Do you like Yudkowsky as a thinker and want to listen to him again"? "Probably not."</p><br><p>Here's another good question. In economics, the standard argument for the Great Stagnation is that since 1970, the United States has had two very different types of economic growth:</p><br><ul>
<li>1 percent growth every year;</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>More than 1 percent growth if you just look long enough.</li>
</ul><br><p>The former is the only type of growth you see in a small, poor country like Iceland. And it only happened during a period marked by a severe financial crisis, wars, and a severe global recession. So the only way it could happen was because it had to, and we only had ourselves to blame.</p><br><p>The latter is the only way you get hypergrowth in a country like China. I like to point to a graph where hypergouph is on the left, and normal growth on the right. And then ask "If you could either have normal growth, or growth as fast as China, which would you choose?" "I don't know, I think I'd pick normal growth."</p><br><p>Well, if you have normal growth for two years, it might still count as hypergouph. But three years passes the test of the long-run trendline.</p><br><p>The counterargument to this is that if you could only have one of two things one year, but then would get the other every year that's pretty good, too. Maybe. But you still don't want more than one. That whole argument seems deeply weird to me.</p><br><p>So if you believe Yudkowsky that the Great Stagnations might be caused by something in America other than American innovation, what should you think? What would the other factors be?</p><br><p>To answer that, let's turn to other books, ones that Yudkowsky really likes.</p><br><p>Bryan Caplan's <em>The Myth of the Rational Voter</em> is a big part of the Great Stagnantation story. Caplan claims that America's political polarization is due to differences in the distribution of ideologies and values among its citizens\xe2\x80\x94that people's views on issues like taxes and government intervention are more extreme than you'd expect by looking at a country's economy. So if you believe in the Great Stagnance\xe2\x80\x94which I do\xe2\x80\x94it's entirely credible that American policy today is driven by the actions of people who are ideologically opposed to mainstream economics, that oppose all attempts at government regulation, and who vote for every Republican presidential candidate ever. That means that their views are unlikely to be corrected even by people who are extremely intelligent.</p><br><p>Here's a sample of Yudkowksy's arguments about Caplan's book in <em>The Sequences</em>.</p><br><p>Yudkowski begins by saying "I will argue that economics is one of the least important sciences, and therefore its practitioners will be the least informed of any major profession on how best to create economic prosperity." This is because economics is the "cognitively demanding" field. To make up for it being demanding cognitively, many economists "think of themselves as nonconformists, and as open-minded, open-mindedness, open-minded" instead of thinking in terms of "black-swan events", "a priori probability estimates", and other stuff that is much more demanding on your rationality. The problem is that once economists think for themselves, they become conventional: "Economists are very good at following accepted wisdom, but not nearly as good at generating new thinking." This is most notably seen "in academic research, which by and large follows the standard statistical and econometric guidelines laid down in journals such as <em>Econometrica</em>..."</p><br><p>Which brings us to:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The best paper on the Great Stagnancy is Robert Gordon's <em>The Rise and Fall of American Growth,</em> first published in 1976. Gordon makes the convincing case that the standard of living we experienced in the postwar period was, for most of it, a product of growth, and therefore that this "special century" was, from a practical perspective, economically insignificant...</p>
