<li>A Final Note From A Quaker</li>
</ul><br><p>_This is a response to two articles on the Quakers. I strongly disagree with both articles, and am not a Quaker (despite having my fair share of relatives here). I thought it might make the discussion here a bit more interesting to discuss why these people dislike the Quakers so much. Hopefully this will also help to educate people on what actually bothers Quakers, and how they are thinking about some matters differently than people generally do. _</p><br><p>The Problem: The Quaks _Are _Bitez</p><br><p>Quakers are notoriously quiet people. This is a stereotype, but I am curious to know what caused this. Most of the people I know don't seem to share this trait, and this has even been true in my family (although there is at least one other person who does not like noise).</p><br><p>One thing that might have caused this is that the people I am talking with don't have much fun. I am an outgoing person, and I love talking, while other people seem to prefer to talk a lot less than I do, and that frustrates me greatly. And that frustration causes negative emotions, of course, which are part of the feedback loop.</p><br><p>Another thing that might have contributed is that this behavior is considered unacceptable in this culture. The Quakers are famous for their "live simply and pray deeply" attitude, which has been embraced by evangelical Christians. (Also, the Quakers are Christian. If you are Jewish I have no idea what they would think in these terms, since Jews are not Christians.) This probably contributes to not wanting to talk with other people much. But I have also heard that there is a kind of jealousy that can accompany this, and someone might be suspicious of something if someone else has it more than you.</p><br><p>A third thing might have contributed to all this is how we view social situations. The Quakers have a culture that is based on getting to know someone and respecting others enough to know they feel good around you and want to talk to you, as well as being sensitive to your needs. One of the key values of this culture is to look at all your friends: there is at least a bit of everyone in anyone's life, and if that needs to be known you take that into consideration.</p><br><p>When I tried out Quaker culture I found that even though it was very different than my own culture, I did not like it very much. </p><br><p>One of the most obvious differences between Quaker and my culture was that Quakers are way more concerned about making others happy. (If all my friends do not care about what I care about, then I don't want to be friends with any of them.) Another important factor that I do not like at first glance is the expectation that I can take care of those around me. I was used to looking out for myself, and expecting that others can do the same. While others can make you happy, it is not a good thing to ask other people to do that for you, unless you have that right. I have been known to find most people too needy.</p><br><p>I also found that the "bitten by an animal" thing is more prominent in Quakers (this might be related) and that this culture is very different from mine. There is a strong rejection of selfless acts, or giving people praise for actions they do not deserve, while being more willing to provide praise and rewards to others. I have never been an animal, and I found this culture very annoying \xe2\x80\x93  I strongly dislike being given praise, especially when it would be better to earn it on your own. </p><br><p>Quakers are also a bit more conformist than I would like in their beliefs. Quakers are also a group of people highly associated with the religious cult known as "Uncle Tom's Cabin", which I found confusing and unpleasant.</p><br><p>The Quakers Are The Bitches</p><br><p>The two major reasons that people dislike Quakers so much are that one of them thinks the world must have the <em>slavery bit</em> \xe2\x80\x93 that the Quakers are an inherently bad or at the very least flawed lot of people, and the other thinks that the Quakers treat other people to an unreasonable extent. The first statement is so absurd as to not even be funny, and the second is just <em>wrong</em>.</p><br><p>You have to put yourself in a Quaker's place, and understand why they might behave that way. The world of the Quakers probably consists of two parts: "God's People" and "The People Around You", and there are two reasons that you care about them: either they are in Your People or in God's People. </p><br><p>In God's People, it is important that the world is run by God (not the government, or the church, or the family, etc). God is in your People, so you are only comfortable with your friends if they are in the same place as you. Some people are a bit more comfortable with people in God's People, while other people are more comfortable with people not in God's People; but there is nothing wrong with wanting friends in your own People, because there is something very beautiful and important about having close connections to all your friends.</p><br><p>In God's people, you can be certain of whatever you want. This could be a religion, it could be school or a group (of your friends or not). In either case, if you find yourself the least bit uncertain of someone's religion or group, it is an insult to the person that you are with.</p><br><p>In The People Around You, God is basically out of the picture. Whatever place you might be in is only important because we share that place. This is not the same thing as caring about friends outside your country, but it is something. Being in the same place is something that you need for your life to be good, but I am more interested in being with people who share that place with me, especially if they have interesting things to share. </p><br><p>God's People versus The People Around You is the main reason that Quakers behave the way they do. The second reason is that there are some Quakers "bitches" who seem to be unable to be happy with life alone, and who use "God's People or The People Around You as an excuse for their own selfish behavior, and also because it is the only defense they have against criticism. There is nothing inherently wrong with taking care of yourself if you want to, but there is also something important about wanting your friends do that for you. To be able to be happy and secure in your own life you do not need God. </p><br><p>The Problem: We Are All God's People</p><br><p>Another problem that the Quakers have with their culture is that it is based around a religion, and a religion is inherently at odds with being good neighbors. We cannot be good neighbors and believe that God exists. </p><br><p>Quaker Culture was not based around a religion specifically, and was founded on religious principles but it was not based around any of the standard beliefs one would have associated with religion. Quakers had a set of beliefs that were supposed to be based on science and reason, and yet it was not clear whether or not God exists. In the end, Quakers ended up being "bitches", and not being good enough to be friends with anyone outside of God's People.</p><br><p>The Quaker Culture that I have seen people who are not Quakers (and therefore more-or-less belong to God's People) adopting is based on their own belief in God. I have been to religious and cultural communities where the main thing to believe was that one's religion is the best, without asking if all religions are equally good, without asking if one belief requires the other beliefs. As long as you had the right beliefs, you belong to God's people. There is nothing special about believing in God \xe2\x80\x93 you can believe in him even if you are an atheist. You have to believe in the religion but not necessarily in God himself, and believe in the religion itself. </p><br><p>"God's People" is a special case of "The People Around Us" \xe2\x80\x93  we all want to be in the same places as our own people, but the Quakers were specifically concerned with being in the same place around God (and not around the church, or friends, or anything else). </p><br><p>It is not clear how many people would still be Quakers today if they could make an argument that they had not been "Born Again". (That said, I am pretty sure that many more Americans today believe in God than used to, and I know people who are very religious, and they are still Quakers).</p><br><p>This all probably doesn't make all that much sense to people from other cultures. People from my culture are used to asking questions, and we probably don't see much difference between knowing that a belief in God's existence does not require the belief in God's moral authority, and knowing that every church in a town has the same beliefs about religion. Those from other cultures might not see much of a difference between believing in religious people and believing in the same religious people having the same moral beliefs as another group of people elsewhere.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
