I mean, why "rationalism", instead of "rationality"? When I first hear this, I think, oh, it's another religion; but then the atheist community is the "atheist community", it seems.  "Scientist" is already a word, but "rational" isn't.</p><br><p>And by "rationalist group" I'd expect there to be something about "rationalists"\xe2\x80\x94people who are really into rationality. A Rationalist is not a rationalist. They are a rationalist.</p><br><p>I've read the sequences, and I've even read the sequences <em>to which Eliezer is addressing.</em> The content is certainly there, if not exactly where I would expect.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>I'm confused that there's also this blog and some conferences. And this book.</p><br><p>I'm also confused that this all happened after the sequences. The sequences are <em>about this.</em></p><br><p>You would think, if the sequences came after the book and the group <em>were</em> something like the sequences blog and the community, it would be obvious why the book and the blog and a conference.</p><br><p>This seems like a strange coincidence.</p><br><p><strong>III.</strong></p><br><p>Why use the word "rationalism" at all, then?</p><br><p>Well, I'm guessing there's a story there. The origin of the word "rational".</p><br><p>"Rationalist" comes from the Greek word "\xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xbb\xcf\x86\xce\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xaf\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xcf\x8c\xcf\x82", a-l-f-f-i-e-m-i\xe2\x80\x94literally, "one who pursues truth".  To <em>rationalize _something means to explain it away using facts; to "rationalize" something is to take it at its literal meaning and reject it for a bad-sounding or more useful-sounding interpretation. You can "rationalize" an argument ("It was really in the best interest of our company to fire X, and Y is a superior employee! You see, X was the best employee we had to offer, while Y has never worked in our company before! Well, they offered a higher wage, so he took it! So, X gets a better company, Y gets a job at a better company, I get a slightly worse company, the company profits $20 more, everybody wins!") or a belief ("You don't believe that, do you? But look at the evidence for what you're _already</em> saying! The evidence <em>for</em> God exists! There's no way I can have an 'atheist' position and <em>still</em> believe that if I saw a burning bush I would think aliens did this!").</p><br><p>So if someone is _truly _pursuing truth, then they are a rationalist; if they say the universe was created in six days and you say it was created in 4 billion years, you may be mistaken about which one is more correct, but both parties are pursuing the truth. If someone makes a mistake, and rationalizes it away with a mistake-making logical move (like denying that the evidence in question proves anything because it only shows P versus\xc2\xacP), then they are being irrational.  (I would define "irrationality" as "any explanation of data that you know, or should know in advance, you can expect a skeptic to be able to shoot down".)  And if a person cannot make reasonable arguments, we should expect them to be a bad rationalist.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
