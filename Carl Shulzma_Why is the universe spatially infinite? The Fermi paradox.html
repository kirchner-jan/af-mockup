<li>The universe is spatially infinite. A spatially infinite universe is just one that can be made infinite without physically changing the universe, like a circle, or a straight line infinitely, or a graph. In any case, the universe and everything in it have, at every time, the same spatially infinite volume.   A spatially infinite number of observer moments can be in a spatially infinite number positions in space, so all observers see that there exists an infinite universe.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>The universe is finite. The observable universe is finite in mass, size, and space. No matter how many "large universes" or "multiverses", it can't be infinite without changing the actual universe. If it's finite, its size/\xe2\x80\x8bvolume is limited to a space that starts with this earth and the whole observable universe would be much bigger/\xe2\x80\x8bfurther away from the sun than it actually seems. The observable universe looks much bigger and further away for various reasons, one of them being there are so few stars that we can't possibly be in contact with them.   A few of these anthropic considerations are actually explained really well in the book the origin of time, "cosmic rays and big bangs: how time came to be", by Martin Rees.</li>
</ol><br><p>If the universe is spatially finite, it begs a question:  why have intelligent life never evolved on our Earth or anywhere else? Our Sun is a small star, in a small galaxy, and we are nowhere near dense with star systems, much less planets. If intelligence is possible in a spatially finite world, why haven't it evolved yet? This is usually known as the Fermi paradox, often discussed under the name of the Great Silence.</p><br><p>I have the answer:   The Fermi Paradox is NOT real. The Great Silence (aka Fermi Paradox) is because we aren't understanding all of the ways that intelligence and civilization can evolve. Most of the places where intelligent life can evolve simply don't have it yet.</p><br><p>A few examples:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Dying planets</strong>. The Milky Way has not produced intelligent life elsewhere in the past. So any intelligent life that evolved elsewhere would have to be the first intelligent life that evolved somewhere. Because it would take a while for intelligent life to spread from planet to planet, this means that there was enough time for intelligent life to evolve, and intelligence to be selected, before the intelligent life arrived on this planet. This is a problem for the Fermi Paradox, because it raises the question of why it took so long for something intelligent to evolve here. </p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p><strong>The Great Dying</strong>. The Universe is now in a period of accelerated cosmic expansion and every star is moving away from everything and there is too much space for intelligent life and technological civilizations to have happened. (see: dark age, expansionism, inflation)  However, at one point that was not the case. If only one of the various phases of expansion in the universe that had slowed down had proceeded faster the other phases would have been free of expansion, and the galaxy wouldn't have had expanding space between everything and the galaxies. Because these phases haven't accelerated it should be possible for intelligent life not to have evolved in many parts of the cosmos. </p><br><p>A more detailed description of this is in my book, the origin of time (part1, part2).</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
