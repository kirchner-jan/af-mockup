This was the beginning of history."</p><br><ul>
<li>John, chapter 1 verbatim.</li>
</ul><br><p>"But <em>what?</em>" you say in shock, "What does the 'Word' <em>mean?</em> Can we take it from there?"</p><br><p>So I'd like to take a couple of moments to talk about what I think the 'Word', if you pardon me the pretension, means.</p><br><p>The 'Word' (which was the <em>first _thing that was) was's-u-x-a-r-t' because it meant 'the thing that was standing in for _that</em>','standing in for' the concept; it was something you used.</p><br><p>"I don't understand," you say with trepidation.  "How can a word possibly be the first thing?"  Ah, but you may be surprised.</p><br><p>Or if you prefer:  The 'Word' was's-l-i-n-g-r-o-w', which was a verb that happened to be of the kind with an object, so it stood-for-<em>that</em> and was used to indicate it (and then of course you had the first noun,'sling', which was meant when you said 'the thing the Word stood-for-.')</p><br><p>"Not even slightly," you say, but now there's a smile on your face.  "It has to be, you know, all <em>sensible</em> from the start."</p><br><p>(If you prefer:  You can say 'first thing of the kind' at the start.)  I shall explain what I mean by'sensible' in a moment, but remember that, according to the definition I'm trying to give, the first thing\xe2\x80\x94the 'Word' if you prefer\xe2\x80\x94_was_ a thing, but was also very special; namely, that you were the only thing in existence; it was an object, a thing, but also an agent.  "The thing standing in for the thing" was also an agent; you weren't standing in, you were standing for.</p><br><p>"Ah," you say, feeling the smile getting wider, "so you're saying I'm the very <em>beginning</em> of history; and everything that happened before me, never existed?"</p><br><p>Exactly that. In the beginning were the objects; that the "Word", standing in for the objects, stood for itself and was not an object. The object-verb-adjective was already standing because it had already been spoken, by a previously existing agent who stands behind and'says' "I am".</p><br><p>Thus the Word had a special significance even by its own definition.</p><br><p>"And the Word itself\xe2\x80\x94is the agent 'I'?"</p><br><p>Well, "I" is the first thing that happens to be, if you like. "I" is what happens next (if you like) when you say you are an X; "I" is how you say that "I am an X"; "I" is you saying, on a lower level, "There I am."  So the answer is:  "I" has occurred; it is a thing; it is what happens next. But not actually any one thing in particular\xe2\x80\x94that would be privileging one set of labels to the exclusion of all previous labels. What happens next, is determined by the labels that have been applied up to now.</p><br><p>"Okay, but this is the <em>beginning!</em> So there must be <em>something</em> before the time when the "I" happens. There must be an object-verb- adjective before the "I" to use to stand in for it."</p><br><p>No. You must <em>define</em> this as the beginning. This "I" is not special in any sense whatsoever; it can't be unique. If it was, you'd have to take it out of the rest of sequence, which it <em>isn't</em>.</p><br><p>"But the first object..."</p><br><p>That was a verb. A verb does not go before another verb. The verb is the agent; the noun is the thing.</p><br><p>"Why, just one second ago we were talking about objects, and now we're discussing agency... so if the first object was a verb, just... can you clarify just exactly what the 'Word' was, please?"</p><br><p>There was nothing standing in for anything. It was just a collection of labels. But if you insist, the Word was the phrase "It is because..."</p><br><p>"No, why did it have to <em>begin</em>, and not just... <em>just happen?</em> If there's nothing before the Big Bang, if there's nothing before time, then the first thing that exists, if you insist on such things... is still the best explanation we have."</p><br><p>And that's true all right. But it seems to me like it would benefit from being less mysterious; since this is one of the few places, I suspect, that some people may wish to go into technical detail about the Nature of Reality.</p><br><p>So:  The Word, which was merely the's-l-"n-g-"r-o-"w", which happened to be the kind of thing with an object and a verbal complement, and was <em>meaningless</em> by its own definition, happened to be used as the label of the object previously called 'the Self', and 'Self' refers to an agent, who happens to be standing for "me".</p><br><p>Did all this seem reasonable and natural in retrospect, when you heard all of it for the first time? Or did it seem ridiculous... in retrospect?</p><br><p>"Ah..." you say slowly, "it seems to <em>me</em> that it probably sounded more reasonable than the theory of the Big Bang."</p><br><p>And indeed so.</p><br><p>"Well?" you ask eagerly.  "I'd better hear about the beginning, then."</p><br><p>So I say that the moment when we first start to observe is still a natural time to talk about the beginning. I say that if you have to define the "Word" as the first thing, or as the first label, you aren't talking about the beginning after all. I also say, if you're <em>actually trying</em> to explain why there is any kind of point to all the previous discussion about the beginnings of the universe... then you <em>really</em> do need some kind of explanation, beyond the word "initial condition".</p><br><p>So the first thing, the <em>simplest</em> explanation, the <em>easiest</em> explanation for the "Word"... is that the "Word" stands for the concept of the Self.</p><br><p>"The <em>Self</em>?" you say.</p><br><p>Yes.</p><br><p>"You <em>want</em> to say the Self exists? You mean <em>this</em> Self, standing in for all others? You believe that an agent exists?"</p><br><p>No. <em>This _Self happens to stand in for all other agents who stand in for themselves.  "I am" and so forth, of which this was the only one that was _really</em> an object.</p><br><p>"Just because I say 'This Self' doesn't make it any more real?"</p><br><p>No, it doesn't, but it does <em>change the labels</em>. No more need for "I" then.</p><br><p>"Wait! There <em>is</em> a person speaking and saying things! How does it all fit together?"</p><br><p>It's... less than perfectly fit together... now, I think, than we might have hoped. The way you speak of it, it sounds to me like you're not actually talking about _any _self who speaks and is heard. You're just imagining a kind of speech act, and then speaking the labels of "I" and "You", which somehow sound to you more real than the labelless thing.</p><br><p>When I tell you, "If you can point out something which was the first object you would think of when you heard the word 'beginning', which you can think of as the first thing that happened after the Big Bang, that thing you just labeled 'The Word', which could have been called's-l"n-g"r-o"w\xe2\x80\x94"</p><br><p>"Okay," you say, having gotten this far, "so if the Self exists, that means the Self just got created. If the Word means 'the thing that exists to serve as a placeholder for the Self', then the first thing which happens is when the placeholder exists."</p><br><p>Just like that, with a <em>single step.</em></p><br><p>"I admit," you say, after a silence, "that just now I had the feeling that, compared to before, this all sounds a little <em>too neat</em> to be true."</p><br><p>It's the way language works; the labels can only stand in for things. The labels are themselves the only things in existence; they are the way the world <em>actually</em> works, rather than that being a nice little verbal story to tell.</p><br><p>"Are you really sure this 'I' doesn't sound too neat? Just so long as there's <em>someone speaking</em> here. The fact that <em>this _person thinks it sounds neat is _proof _of its coherence, even if we aren't sure what _exactly</em> the speaker might be thinking at any particular time."</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
