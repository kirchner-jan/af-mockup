These posts are largely based on a paper from 2008, with new material written by me. To read the previous post in series, click here.</p><br><p>In short, though everyone has a lot in common, individual humans have a lot of their thought processes determined by random factors. To study human rationality, we need to account for those random components. In this post and the next, I'm going to look at two of these random factors: the distribution of sensory information in our eyes (vision), and the distribution of information in our brains as a whole (mindreading). I'll then speculate on how we can use that knowledge to improve our thinking.</p><br><p><strong>1. What are the visual and intellectual distributions in the human brain and body?</strong></p><br><p>There's a lot more to vision processing than I'm able to fully describe here (for a popular introduction to this, check out this talk, or "Seeing with Your Brain," or at least "Optimal Control: the Brain and Perception.") But as best I can describe it, there are a few basic principles going on:</p><br><p>Humans have a limited resolution in their visual field, but most of the field outside of our peripheral vision (which humans are capable of seeing) is processed by the visual system as though it were much higher resolution. (A few details about why this is true have to do with the different visual acuities between humans, but for the sake of this post I'm guessing we can ignore that.) A lot of visual processing is "local" to the field that is being processed. This means that a pattern of light in the visual field causes a corresponding pattern of neural firings to occur in our brains (or even more precisely, to arise in the visual cortex, where the information about the visual field is extracted and understood). For vision to be effective/\xe2\x80\x8bcapable, this has to be done in a localized fashion. This means that, in the visual field outside of the visual cortex, there has to be a lot of information loss. For example, a black and white image of a square with black and white pixels doesn't generate the same neural firings as a black and white movie of a square with a lot of color.</p><br><p>Humans also have specialized areas for vision processing (the visual cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and maybe a few others). These all have different patterns of neural firings. I mentioned previously that there are a few details about why that is true, but I'm not sure if I can really summarize them here. In humans, you can see an inverted Y at one end, and a ladder at the other end of the visual field. These correspond to two different "features of space" that are uniquely processed by different areas of the visual field: an inverted Y is one of the earliest and simplest visual inputs to reach the visual cortex for humans, whereas the ladder is one of the later visual inputs, but more interesting.</p><br><p>Humoral processing in the brain, on the other hand, does not follow this pattern. When you do something like add two numbers together, you are getting sensory information from both your visual and from your brain via a common medium. Even though there really are two different kinds of inputs to the brain. (This might be one of the reasons why people are so bad at arithmetic by practicing it instead of by practicing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.) The brainstem does not "add" sensory information from the visual and from the brain, but rather, it uses <em>the</em> <em>input</em> it receives to estimate the value of the input, and then combines that value with the value of the sense of smell and proprioception and so on. Again, the details of this are fairly mysterious to me. We know that it's not purely perceptual, because if you don't see with your eyes, you can get a feeling of what the words are trying to refer to by using your other senses.</p><br><p>In the same way that humans can do complex tasks with just their visual systems, they can also do complex tasks with a little help from their brain. For example, when we're learning, the "low-level" sensory information from our brain does as much as the "high-level" sensory input coming from our eyes. They're just complementary processes. The ability that humans have to do complex tasks with the help of their brain is essential for reasoning, and it is one of the best-studied "foundations" of human rationality. The most important fact about this fact is that it isn't something you can "learn as you go." You have to be born with the ability to do complex reasoning. We don't learn to be good at physics because we haven't been hit in the head enough with a sledgehammer.</p><br><p>From now on, we're going to be talking about how this plays out when one process is leading your thinking and another process is trying to make sure a thought doesn't happen. As with many things in life, it's helpful to have a visual image:</p><br><p><em>In this post, the brain processes its own information with the help of its sensory systems (vision and mindreading), whereas the outside world is using complex reasoning to influence them. If that were reversed, we might ask: does someone with normal vision need to undergo special training to process complex visual information?</em></p><br><p><strong>2. What do the visual and cognitive distributions in each of us look like?</strong></p><br><p>As the human brain has about twice as many neurons as it needs to perform most complex tasks necessary to survive, it would be nice if our brains were optimized not to have a wide variety of cognitive functions that only functioned when most cognitive functions were not needed. However, that's not really what seems to be the case. Humans are constantly using our brains to do complex tasks, and to evaluate which tasks might be important, or which tasks are getting in the way. So it seems quite reasonable that we'd want our brains not only to be good enough at most complex tasks for us to make it to adulthood alive and able to reproduce, but also to be as efficient as possible at what they actually do.</p><br><p>To put this in visual terms, I'll be representing the distributions of our cognitive skills (and the various constraints on them), together with the distributions of our visual systems, as probability distributions.</p><br><p>A lot of our thinking ability is concentrated in our prefrontal cortex and in some other relatively smallish brain regions. Most of the working memory we use in our heads is distributed throughout the brain.</p><br><p>If we plot a histogram of who has the cognitive function that is more or less concentrated across the brain, the two distributions pretty much line up, except for the part of our working memory that's represented in our brains rather than having to use the visual system or other peripheral senses. And there are still some areas of the prefrontal cortex that are in charge of planning, reasoning, decision making, and doing complex cognitive tasks.</p><br><p>But for the most part, our cognitive abilities are distributed pretty evenly throughout the brain (at least in the frontal lobes), though they also look a bit like they're more highly concentrated in the visual areas of the brain, which is probably because these areas are better than other parts of the brain at learning and processing visual input.</p><br><p>Even in less developed brains, the prefrontal cortex is used for a lot, and it is still used to integrate input from peripheral senses and to solve some of the most important tasks for the brain: identifying when actions might go wrong, and so on.</p><br><p>That means that for high-level functions like reasoning, planning and decision-making, the distributions in our brains are all roughly equal in terms of the amount of computing power that they need. (And the distributions in the visual cortex look about as similar in the parts that those functions are primarily or exclusively performed in.)</p><br><p>But there are also some things about our brains that are more distributed on the scale of neurons/\xe2\x80\x8bneurons/\xe2\x80\x8bneurons, than they would be otherwise expected, due to the constraints of the structures that need the extra neurons to make the brain better/\xe2\x80\x8bbetter/\xe2\x80\x8bbetter:</p><br><p><strong>3. Cognitive limitations and brain constraints</strong></p><br><p><strong>3a. Cognitive limitations</strong></p><br><p>Some functions in our thoughts are only performed when other functions are not required. This isn't always immediately obvious; it usually goes unnoticed until it interferes with some other task, or you develop some "blockage" in your mind due to a failure to process a situation properly. For example, if you have some block in your mind caused by not processing well the information in a particular part of what you're looking at, then the thought of that part of the visual field can easily sneak its way into your mind. But this tends to lead to thoughts about a whole area being more or less noisy/\xe2\x80\x8bblurry, which can cause errors in what the overall visual field looks like in your mind.</p><br><p>Another example is the "failure" of people to consider all the facts when they do a cost-benefit analysis. On the other hand, if you think about it, this is actually quite a beneficial feature in some environments.</p><br><p>In my experience, the largest class of cognitive limits are caused by an inability to process the information in a certain part of our peripheral vision, but because of the constraints imposed by the brain.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
