Again, higher C3 and CRP levels correlated positively with higher scores on the intelligence tests. </p><br><p>The pattern of results for the four variables is consistent with genetic and hormonally mediated variation in intelligence (which we term_ e.g. _"__Intelligence-Related Heritable Traits"). _</p><br><p>We also performed a meta-analysis on previously published research, examining the significance of these findings and the degree to which they differ by study design, outcome and trait studied.</p><br><p>We found consistent significant associations between individual C3, CRP, testosterone and SHBG levels. As far as we know, there has been no published research examining the correlations between IQ and C3 and CRPs (or, to our knowledge, any type of blood marker for inflammation or the major innate immune response).</p><br><p>We therefore report these new correlations, and attempt to explain them in terms of the known biology of the complement system. As our theory suggests for the biological basis for the heritability of intelligence, higher IQ would be expected to correlate with complement factor C3 and some forms of complement factor C3 (such as Factor H) lower serum or lower salivary concentrations of C3, and some forms of CRP are expected to correlate with intelligence. </p><br><p>Finally, we discuss the implications of this research for both research on intelligence-related traits and research into genetic risk factors for disease. </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
