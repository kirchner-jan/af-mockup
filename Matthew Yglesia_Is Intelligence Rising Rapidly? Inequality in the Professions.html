Now, three decades later, a majority of college graduates pursue jobs in these graduate programs, and some are entering the field with much less preparation than they used to. It's a startling story of growth and inequality, and it would be a mistake to miss its implications.What does this story imply about how we should think about the future?</p><br><p><strong>The End of Education: What is a Human being?</strong></p><br><p>Our education system is heavily influenced by the educational philosophies of the 1960s and earlier \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, a tradition of thought based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or "psychotherapy," a discipline that arose from the study of cognitive psychology in the 1970s.</p><br><p>The psychotherapy revolution began in the context of a larger scientific movement exploring the nature of human minds. The cognitive revolution, commonly called "behaviorism," was the study of mental processes as they are actually implemented within a real-world environment. The view that minds consist of separate "brains" or subpersonalities was replaced by the view that thoughts could take place <em>merely</em> through an interplay between individual mechanisms in the brain's physical processes.</p><br><p>Psychotherapy arose directly from this approach, and its fundamental assumption is that humans have malleable mental states that can be trained in response to their experience. In this light, the central focus is to teach people how to modify their own behavior by providing them with access to a "therapist," or some other practitioner of the discipline.</p><br><p>From its inception, this approach to therapy seemed extremely limited: it couldn't work with humans who are simply incapable of changing their behavior. This was a challenge that neuroscientists \xe2\x80\x94 who were also studying the physical basis of cognition \xe2\x80\x94 began to address in the 1970s, when researchers developed the notion of "cognitive neuroscience."</p><br><p>The cognitive revolution gave rise to many new research fields. One of the central goals of modern neuroscience is to better understand how human thought works on an algorithmic level. This involves modeling thinking in terms of the brain's information-processing capacity: how it learns, what kinds of representations we use, and so on.</p><br><p>In the 1980s, this began to give rise to a number of other research programs. One of the more prominent was artificial intelligence, which arose in part out of the conviction that computers can better understand the structure of mathematical mindsets that humans have been using for thousands of years, but that are difficult to translate into anything resembling real-world use. A second discipline, computational neuroscience, helps us understand the physical mechanisms of the different information-processing programs implemented in the brain; it is perhaps most associated with the study of machine learning and statistical methods.</p><br><p><strong>Training Minds: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</strong></p><br><p>One of the central themes of modern psychology is that behavior reflects beliefs. To have a consistent, internally-consistent view of yourself as an agent means that you have consistent beliefs about your behavior. However, beliefs are only <em>part</em> of the story. Beliefs are a function of the environment an agent encounters, and if your environment radically alters then so will your beliefs. To have lasting change in behavior, psychology teachers claim, you need to intervene on the <em>actual behavior</em>.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, this doesn't mean you get to decide who to send to your school's science classes. In the 1960s, researchers made the surprising discovery that, across different professions, the most experienced teachers had developed a common set of beliefs about the nature of human psychological problems, and teachers new to the profession could quickly learn these beliefs by observing those experienced teachers. This finding has become one of the central tenets of modern behavioral education, and it was a major inspiration behind a program of education reform in the country known by the slogan "education must compete to prove itself."</p><br><p>As research on the teaching profession in the United States began to reveal, it quickly became clear that the traditional behavioral education approach was not, itself, compatible with education in general, which was moving closer and closer towards the idea that education is a social or public good. The old educational paradigm had been based on the premise that the purpose of education was to give the poor and low-performing members of society a basic foundation in academic or vocational training. The basic tenets of this mindset had helped many people achieve success in elementary school and middle school, but from the perspective of the mid-80s, this approach started to seem somewhat outdated.</p><br><p>The problem with the existing behavioral education program was that by the late 80s, it was clear that the students weren't responding to the curricula that had been put in front of them by their teachers. According to one recent study, this represented a "pipeline crisis" in education. Students were failing to learn what students had been told to learn, and teachers were not getting help from their departments in addressing the problem. A major step in the right direction, according to this model, was to shift educational priorities towards addressing the needs of students who had failed to respond to previous educational efforts.</p><br><p><strong>The Case for a Growing Pie, Part II</strong></p><br><p>While it's clear that public education has undergone a lot of changes in the last thirty years, we should also be aware that much of the progress has been modest, incremental, or difficult to measure. For example, the percentage of students who fail to succeed \xe2\x80\x94 in terms of course grades or dropping out \xe2\x80\x94 in the first attempt at college has remained relatively intact even as the number of students has sharply increased. This is probably because the "college readiness" construct has improved through the years, with college readiness measures expanding to include skills such as test-taking, self-promotion, academic "will," and other skills such as "life skills," "problem solving," and "critical thinking." As a result, the "first attempt at college" rate hasn't budged.This is not to say these metrics were always meaningless. In my early days of teaching, students with above-average intellectual ability were much more likely to succeed in my classes, but this only became more true as I gained experience with smarter students. The best students, then, had a clear incentive to self-promote in order to get in and stay in. More recently, at the beginning of the decade, I noticed that the difference between the above-average students I had encountered at the start and the students I knew in college were much bigger in the latter group: their above-average status was more transparently obvious, and most of the students in the later group seemed to genuinely want to improve in comparison to the former. It's easy to overestimate gains in a field when you're in it, but if you step back for a moment and try to remember the difference between "better" and "less good," you can probably get a sense of what the difference was in the world I was encountering as a college teacher, circa 1997-2001.</p><br><p>In the modern version of this story, colleges are more and more trying to compete with one another, with the resulting growth in student numbers \xe2\x80\x94 combined with an increasingly strong commitment to raising standard for both students and programs \xe2\x80\x94 playing a key role in driving up the demand for college graduates. Colleges are competing to prove their value by offering students opportunities to work with teachers who have undergone rigorous training, and to help students prepare for college and university life. And these challenges of college preparation are likely to be a major focus of research and reform over the coming years.<strong>The Case for an Open Field</strong></p><br><p>There's still a lot of skepticism that students will succeed in college, or even that they will benefit from the extra learning they get from college. The skepticism is reasonable given the fact that the average college graduate earns less that $50,000 per year starting out in college. At some level of intelligence, then, people will continue to see education as a negative-sum game.</p><br><p>What we shouldn't do, though, is underestimate the power of education to increase the average standard of living. The current narrative assumes that college education is a one-way ticket. But at its core, education is a two-way street. Even if one only assumes that a typical college graduate stays on and gets a job, this means that more than three-fourths of the people who went to college will never get their degree. Not only do a lot of those people drop out before they finish, but many of those who graduate end up not having much impact on the job market due to the growing demand for educated workers.</p><br><p>Even more troubling, this two-way street extends beyond college to the rest of life. Once people are older and more mature, they too can spend their time on a wider range of occupations which is positively correlated with quality of life. Of course, employers will always be able to hire the "lower-skilled" employees first: the high-skilled ones will often have trouble finding a job if they can't get a starting position on the strength of their r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s. The growing demand for high-skilled labor, according to this narrative, plays a major role in a slow-growing pie.But, as we can see from this narrative, we can imagine a future where the pie doesn't grow: one where all the jobs are the same as today, only with higher quality.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
