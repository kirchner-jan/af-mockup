Often, they want to know something important. But they also want that something important. So their search space is huge: They want to know something and they want it to be important and they both search for the most important and the most important to them.</p><br><p>So the scientist searches through all of these possible things, and for each set of factors, they consider all possible combinations: Do they interact in this way? Would knowledge of more combinations of factors, including this one, make the research more important, if knowledge of this one isn't enough? Will gaining information from this new source of evidence also shift other beliefs, perhaps in a useful way? These are all considered, along with other questions, to see if a particular line of inquiry is promising.</p><br><p>This process of search is called inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a sort of "scientific method", which is widely acclaimed as the best way to discover knowledge. The idea is that if humans were allowed to follow the scientific method and use inductive reasoning, we could, in a short amount of time, determine everything important.</p><br><p>So then science would be a great project. But it's not actually all that great. It's not, at any rate, ideal.</p><br><p>It doesn't start with the true questions. Scientists don't know, or care, what questions they have, only questions that seem promising.</p><br><p>There's no way, even in theory, to figure out what these questions would be. Even those at the forefront of development may not have decided, until the last minute, what the research might be. If they had, they would never make themselves public; they wouldn't stand to be questioned about their choice. Instead, they'd take solace in the fact that no one would have ever heard of their choice to make.</p><br><p>So science is based on a foundation of guesses. Guided by their favorite hypotheses, scientists search through their huge search-space, and try to produce novel combinations. If it worked, they'd have the solution, with no more work. In theory, if only you could use induction and science, all you needed was someone who just wanted to find a way to find a way.</p><br><p>And yet, scientific research is not like that. Scientific research is far more collaborative than that. If it worked in theory and it's new, it still might not get published. There may be a large number of competing ideas, and many of them may be more promising than the current one, some of which might turn out to be correct. As often as not, the best paper gets published, and no one who contributed substantially to it gets recognized.</p><br><p>So what does inductive reasoning get right, but science generally fails at? How does it do so well, even when science fails so widely?</p><br><p>There are many theories. The simplest is that inductive reasoning is good at finding questions that are not too hard to think about and where new information would be useful. It's also good at guessing from available clues.</p><br><p>Another theory is that the scientific method is most useful for making accurate predictions. It's good at avoiding errors from not asking the right questions.</p><br><p>A third is that inductive rational is good at avoiding "dodging the question. "A question that could get you fired. A question asked by religious fanatics, political leftists, or similar groups. A question that wouldn't take much work to find an answer to but it seems like it might be dangerous to know the answer to.</p><br><p>Another is that inductive rationality is best suited to science in fields where it's particularly expensive to get feedback, and the results matter more: economics, psychology, sociology, history, paleontology, anthropology.</p><br><p>And a fourth is that it's a good model of how the human mind does inductive reasoning.</p><br><p>All of these things are true. Inductive rationality is bad at things where there's an easy way to check answers, such as math problems, and where the results really don't matter unless you have a theory that doesn't rely on them.</p><br><p>A more interesting question is what inductive reason gets _right. _What problems does science solve better than anyone could come up with in their own head? What do people in science want or need, that science can provide, that the world's best thinkers can't?</p><br><p>I don't have a strong answer to these questions, but I thought maybe people here might have some interesting ideas.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
