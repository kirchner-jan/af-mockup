I figured that it'd be a good idea to look it up and find out. So here's what I found:</p><br><p>Wikipedia says that Richard Feynman has the second highest number of patents (2,865) and that these were mostly associated with material research. He's also listed as a co-author on 2,101 papers.</p><br><p>In a paper by Feynman, et al, "The Feynman Lectures on Physics: A New Approach to Teaching and Learning Physics", there are references in Table 2 to his publications in science journals. He's also mentioned in a few others.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>If students are given Feynman diagrams, they become interested. By the end of the first semester, more than 80% of the class have used it</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>It has been reported that Feynman had a large number of students who wrote out matrices, equations, and graphs from scratch while he was writing the diagrams.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>He describes himself as reading all of the papers he could get his hands on, but his actual number of publications is around 10,000</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>In a class of 30 students, six students reported publication rates above 90%. One student wrote more than 200 articles for publication. At least one student's best article was accepted by a journal of a major scientific society for publication. However, he decided to go down to the lesser known smaller societies because that was easier to publish in.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Source</p><br><p>It seems clear that his research was not the only thing that made him a prolific author. But how much research did he really do?</p><br><p>After a bit of Googling, I could only find that "The Feynmans, inventors and academics they inspired: the role of knowledge in creativity".</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Of the more than a hundred authors that the Feynmans inspired, less than 10 are considered creative geniuses. Instead, they are generally known as "the Feynmans' army", "the Feynman gang", or "the Feynmen mafia". These are some of the names that Feynman himself used for the people inspired by his work. Feynman, who was intensely interested in knowing who these people are and what they did, once claimed that each of these people was the most impressive person he ever met.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Source</p><br><p>However, the "Feynmant mafia" paper also mentions that when Feynman and his wife went to India, they were able to meet most of the geniuses in the country. So maybe it was more like a "the Feynmants", who made friends with people in the know.</p><br><p>After Googling around, I saw that Feynman was also listed as something of a genius in a biographies book, although the site links to Feynman's autobiographical essays where he says that his "creativity" comes from his "fascinating hobby as a teacher". He also once referred to his "childhood passion [as a] dream of becoming a brilliant scientist".</p><br><p>In a talk he gave called "Why I Left Mathematics and What I'll Do Now", Feynman says:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I tried doing algebra as part of my research, but I found that I didn't enjoy it. I didn't like the problem setting up and the problem solving part, I found it very tiring. So then when I discovered that people were having fun with this material I decided to leave and go into physics instead. [...]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>[... I was] still trying to figure out what I was going to be doing and how to go about it. And I went to an interesting fellow named John Wheeler... I had worked with him on the atomic structure of the atomic nucleus, and had a lot of respect for him. [...] [Wheeler] said that he had the same problem, and that he thought he could do it, and it looked quite interesting so he was going to do it. So he started\xe2\x80\x94he had to work out some things to get the calculations clear and get his answer, but it was very much in that spirit of "If we can't do it, no one can do it." [...]</p><br><p>Wheeler said that he was going to work out some examples, and he wrote me a note, he said he was ready, because he didn't have enough time for me to come to his office to discuss it, nor did I know where he was; he told me that he was working in a room somewhere. Then he would write me a postcard, and then he would mail it to me, and I'd think what an interesting fellow it was that had solved a problem that seemed solvable to me.</p><br><p>And then I received a postcard, the next time I was on the train. It said, "What I am just about to write will solve the most important problem in nuclear physics; what I have just written is one step towards solving it."</p><br><p>Well. I could still remember the problem and the approach, so I couldn't get out of the car when he reached me.</p><br><p>[... the] great thing about the postcard was that it was really in the spirit of the work. Then I decided I'd better go to Wheeler's office and talk it over with him. And that's how I came to physics.</p><br><p>Source </p><br><p>So at least Feynman was aware of his influence on someone, and it sounds like the influence was probably mutual\xe2\x80\x94Feynman did give Wheeler advice on how to solve the atomic nucleus problem. Unfortunately, I don't know that much about Feynman's research.</p><br><p>My original question\xe2\x80\x94would there be a correlation between <em>rate of breakthroughs</em> and <em>rate of math/\xe2\x80\x8bscience publication</em>\xe2\x80\x94was partially answered by Googling, but in doing so I found something interesting:</p><br><p>Feynman's first paper on quantum electrodynamics was published in a physics journal. Of the three dozen papers that made up his career, only one of these, the one that first introduced the concept of the Feynman integral, was published in a math journal. The Feynman integral is an integral that needs to be split up into parts. The Feynmans claimed to have invented the integral so quickly that they got the answer to the integral before the paper could be published.</p><br><p>Source.</p><br><p>The Feynmans also claimed that they invented the technique of summing the Feynman diagrams\xe2\x80\x94which turns out to be exactly equivalent to the technique of summarizing and simplifying diagrams that appear when doing more standard calculations.</p><br><p>Source for math summaries, and source on Feynmans summing up Feynman diagrams.</p><br><p>The first of their papers listed above, the article on quantum electrodynamic effects in beta decay, makes reference to Feynman diagrams and how they're useful for calculations. And Feynman's third paper with Feynman, the one involving the sum of Feynmann diagrams, cites Feynmans first article as a source for the sum.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, these books are more of a summary than a detailed description. If anyone has a source with actual diagrams and calculations, I'd be interested in seeing it.</p><br><p>But still: we have a candidate for a correlation. What was the relationship, if any, between Rate of Mathematical Breakthroughs vs Amount of Calculations Performed and Rate of Math/\xe2\x80\x8bScience Publication? I'd guess that it would be quite weak as there's probably a lot of nonlinearity going on. Also Feynman's most famous contributions to physics were not the breakthroughs themselves, but the Feynman integrals and the way he got the results.</p><br><p>How about Rate of Mathematicical Breakthroughs for other subjects? I'd guess no correlation is warranted, but still, a few more papers and calculations would be worth a stab at. Anyone who has papers/\xe2\x80\x8bbooks on mathematical ability and the rates of math publications in journals, would be most welcome to add to the comments.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
