I first started paying attention to it in high school, when my biology class took a field trip to the Grand Canyon. The tour included a presentation by the tour guide about the wonders of rock formation, as well as a demonstration using one of the famous Grand Canyon tricks, where a geologist made a hole in the wall of the canyon larger than the person who is about to take the illusion. I was more interested in the demonstration than in the lecture.</p><br><p>A couple of years ago, at a party I was at in the San Fernando Valley I encountered a fellow named Richard Wiseman, who had a book about various subjects, such as magic tricks and stage magic. My interest was piqued. I began to study a few of the most famous magic tricks, and also the many more that I didn't know existed\xe2\x80\x94and tried to formulate a theory which would explain the tricks.</p><br><p>I discovered that the key to the trick is the presentation. The effects are so astounding because they take place behind a curtain of absolute darkness; if you can read the title of the trick in lights on the wall, it means no effect could happen.</p><br><p>On the one hand, this appears totally hopeless. If you explain the phenomenon in terms of classical probability theory, it's impossible to make a convincing presentation. Either the coin has a tiny little tail, in which case it doesn't appear to be going to land heads, or it has no one little tiny piece of metal on it, in which case how can it "almost land heads"?  You can't describe how the coin was created, except to say that it started out as a perfectly flat coin. No classical physics would allow the impossible possible.</p><br><p>On __t__he other hand, the concept of subjective anticipation seems at odds with the very idea of probability. If you accept quantum physics, the probabilities of finding yourself in a given state or a small neighborhood of a given state, are not defined in terms of your "knowledge" of the world, but in terms of things like the Born rule, which determine the probability of finding a measurement result given the state that you started in. So\xe2\x80\x94it seems like if a trick gets performed, the trick can be explained in terms of physics and quantum probability theory, while simultaneously leaving out the fact that you know anything about the coin.</p><br><p>I soon ran into my first problem with the Born rule\xe2\x80\x94what is the Born rule? One popular answer is that the Born rule is just a way of calculating the probabilities of finding you in a particular state of knowledge. But then you have to ask "why does this knowledge have any meaning at all?"  And even then, you're saying "I assign prior probability p to the state of knowledge I have, and now I update that probability on my observations of the world, which is a calculation based on my knowledge of physics."  And then you say: "But this knowledge of physics I have, is just another state of knowledge!"</p><br><p>I found myself running out of answers, so I came up with an idea: what if the Born rule is actually a physical fact that determines a measurement outcome, rather than being a property of knowledge?</p><br><p>Let's suppose that a measurement result always has an outcome, and the Born rule says how likely that outcome is given some particular state of knowledge that you started with. Well\xe2\x80\x94which one of these is my starting state of knowledge? Well, actually there are three states of knowledge, corresponding to the different outcomes\xe2\x80\x94not necessarily in order, of course.</p><br><p>__State of knowledge corresponding to outcome #1:<strong><em> There's a coin that has either no little piece of metal on the coin, or the coin is not perfectly flat but has a tiny little tiny little tail on it.</em></strong></p><br><p>You start out in a state of knowledge corresponding to this outcome. Then when you measure the coin, you find that it appears not to have any piece of metal on; the Born rule calculates that the result of that measurement, the "finding no piece of metal", has a very high probability, given that your other states of knowledge correspond to either no little piece, or the coin being flat with no little piece.</p><br><p>Okay, I'm still quite sure that the coin is either a little piece of metal, or it's not flat and does have a little tiny piece of material on.</p><br><p>__How about state of knowledge corresponding neither outcome #a or outcome #b: <strong><em>The coin has a little piece of material on it, and nothing else, and you have no knowledge of the coin being either a little piece or not at all a little piece.</em></strong></p><br><p>If there are two tiny little tiny pieces of metal on the surface of the coin, and that's all there is, then you have no knowledge that it could be a little metal piece, or that it could be no metal piece. But then from my own state of ignorance, <em>I</em> don't see that there <em>could</em> be two tiny metal pieces of any kind on the coin! So the Born rule calculates a low probability that I will "find" two little tiny metal pieces on the coin.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
