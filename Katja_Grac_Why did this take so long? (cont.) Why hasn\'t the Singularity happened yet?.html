<p>For example, it's been known for at least three months that a single programmer [1] can run a modern smartphone on a battery that lasts for about five hours\xe2\x80\x94without it visibly going to sleep, without it switching off, without needing to reduce the brightness of the screen, without need for a phone case. It's actually been known about for a year that a modern smartphone can be plugged into a power outlet, and still talk to you, and have a charge left, while it charges, and get enough power to do other things. The smartphone's battery isn't even "discharging" while it charges; the charge is just being drained into the wall via the circuit. A very brief, low-intensity "charge" is still enough, more or less, to maintain a constant supply of energy, without the need for any battery. All the smartphone needs to keep running as a smartphone is to keep receiving instructions over the airwaves from your computer, instructing it to tell the phone what to do next, and sending it the results. It could perform all this for days if it needed to, without going to sleep or switching off or needing any human attention, as long as the instructions contain no errors and the computer keeps sending them. And when you want it to do anything nontrivial, like look up something on the internet, it can just send it a request, and the computer sends back the exact text of the webpage\xe2\x80\x94rendered, not just transmitted\xe2\x80\x94so there's no delay. Asking it to actually look up anything would, of course, be superfluous.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>And a modern laptop can be plugged into an ordinary wall socket, and run with no noticeable drop in performance, while also being charged. And you can plug in your smartphone into your laptop, and both devices will continue to talk to one another, even as the laptop does something nontrivial, such as answering questions on their respective Internet forums. I could go on and on about this, but I could also just copy and paste a bunch of examples.</p><br><p>At some point the Singularity is not going to be an "ordinary" technological development or even a very high-end technological development. It will be a <em>fundamentally</em> different kind of thing, a new mode of technological progress that does not exist today. I don't yet see any good reason to think that it can't happen tomorrow, or the day after that.</p><br><p>I'm pretty sure human engineers can build software, and that software can talk to humans, and that anything with enough processing power can learn to write better software and talk to humans. But it is not at all obvious (to me, anyhow) that the software in question can learn by itself to write better software or to talk to humans, without ever having been trained by a human\xe2\x80\x94the way evolution "trained" chimpanzees to ride around on their own backs by letting them play with other chimpanzees.</p><br><p>I am not as sure about 'fundamentally different' in this context, but to me it seems like this is a somewhat different use of the word, as I am going to discuss in detail soon anyway, and it seems like such that using it to describe the 'fundamental change' that might lead to human uploads seems a bit unnecessary. It seems that we use the word'mind-altering' or'self-improving' for a bunch of other similar phenomena as well. Perhaps it's worth separating them, but also worth noting that the 'Singularity' might not cause any of the other mind-altering events, like uploads, human in-vitro evolution, or nuclear fusion. It just seems like the Singularity could be the first of these in which we figure out how, at the right time and with the right technology. So I want to discuss this in a bit more detail now that I see some better background from the rest of this post.</p><br><p>I believe that Eliezer (and presumably various others including Holden) have been giving the idea of'mind altering' a bit less weight or importance than others, or at least a bit more importance than it seems like they should have been based on how'mind-altered' things are currently used. E.g. we use the word in various ways to encompass uploading, nuclear fusion, and genetic engineering before the 'Singularity.' So it probably didn't take too long to grasp the idea that things could be changed in particular ways via technology, and the idea that things that changed in particular ways could be called Singularities.</p><br><p>And then as we discuss many things have happened in the near past which look and act similar to the Singularity, so maybe this was obvious for quite a long time. But I actually think it took a long time for people to _not _understand the idea of 'Singularity' referring to technological changes of this kind, at least in a way that didn't require a particular prior context.</p><br><p>Some of the confusion I can sort of explain here is that 'the Singularity' sounds so cool and interesting, and people already use the word in interesting ways so much, that if something has not been the Singularity so far it has felt like it could not have been. I mean, I certainly feel that way about the time of writing this post (and perhaps many people).</p><br><p>I think one might have been confused because of how closely the world's technology seems to match up with their conceptions of 'the past or future super-intelligent' and 'the Singularity.' I think that for a number of people, as long as they have some vague idea that there are kinds of minds out there that can be super-intelligent they are fairly used to taking this as some thing that is a thing you can expect. But it isn't a straightforward thing. I guess, for me, the whole idea _seems _like super-intelligence. You take'superego' from the concept of 'benevolence,' for example, and you get'superefficient' mind. You just take that and make it smarter, and then it becomes super-super-mind. You just take this thing that is just in the realm of the ordinary mind and bring it to'super-super-mind' without any particular insight or change. And then once your brain starts to do this kind of thing that's when things get to be super-intelligences.</p><br><p>And so I think that this view of super-intelligence is sort of more like, that's kind of how intelligence works already. But in actual reality you just go to super-super-intelligence via a path that mostly just requires you to make existing things smarter in the right ways. And then you can just wait a little bit for the first super-super-human intelligence, and at least that's what it seems like for me.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
