He taught a course on formal arithmetic, and gave a seminar on second-order logic. He mentioned the famous incompleteness theorem, and talked about how you would have to solve a problem with all the rules of formal arithmetic to prove Fermat's last theorem true, if the problem were large enough.</p><br><p>And I wanted to know what all my classmates already knew about\xe2\x80\x94why did all of you sit there in rapt attention, rather than drifting off into a state of total disinterest?\xe2\x80\x94so I asked, "Are you familiar with Godel's Completeness and Incompleteness theorems?"</p><br><p>And you answered, "No! What do those theorems say?"</p><br><p>I answered, "They show that any theorem that has a formal proof in first order axioms and rules of inference, can also be proved in the second-order axiom schema <em>for all x, y1(x)!= y2(x)</em>."</p><br><p>They said, "But that doesn't say <em>anything</em>, about which theorems are <em>true in the real world</em>."</p><br><p>And I answered, "If Fermat's last conjecture wasn't true in the real world, then the incompleteness theorem would apply to it; we would show that the real world obeys the formal system of arithmetic, and also there are true statements that can't be proved or disproven within the system."</p><br><p>And they said, "But if the real world has a rule <em>in</em> the system that says there are true statements which aren't provable, is the system actually <em>more compact</em> than the real world?"</p><br><p>And I said, "I think that's a rather good question\xe2\x80\x94"</p><br><p>So now you know what happened when I tried to introduce my classmates to Godelian logical systems. A lot of you don't, because it didn't happen to any of you\xe2\x80\x94if the <em>actual</em> Godelian logical system, the axioms of Peano Arithmetic, or ZFC, or Godel numbering, or set theory, or the mathematical induction axioms, or the axiom schema for second-order logic, aren't a natural part of your experience\xe2\x80\x94if it <em>never,</em> until this second, ever occured to you, as a candidate Godelian formula. It's almost like watching a movie, where you know what's supposed to happen next, and then suddenly it becomes your past in another universe\xe2\x80\x94the Godelian logical formalism is just this mysterious, distant thing that you've never heard of, which is outside the range of ordinary human experiences.</p><br><p>Godelian formulas like those which encode Fermat's last theorems, are not at all the Godelian formula which encodes theorems that are true.</p><br><p>But if your brain doesn't already know about Godel numbering <em>at least</em>, you, and probably some of your friends, have probably never heard of Godel's Complementarity Theorem.</p><br><p>Godelmanning is the special property of Godel numbering where the numbers denote not propositions\xe2\x80\x94the natural numbers, or even 'numbers' of the form \xe2\x88\x80x.... \xe2\x88\xa7 (\xe2\x88\x83y. xy=y) - but formulas.</p><br><p>If \xce\xa6 is a formula over first-order Peano mathematics, i.e., \xce\xa6(n) = true, if n is a nonzero number, then the Godelman of \xce\xa6(n), in first-order Pean arithmetic, is a well-formed formula.</p><br><p>And if <em>\xce\xa6</em> is a formula over second-order Peano arithmetic, i.e. \xce\xa6(n, m) = true, for all nonzero integers n and m, then <em>\xe2\x88\x80x \xe2\x87\x9b \xce\xa6(n): x = 1 \xe2\x87\x94 \xce\xa6(n - 1)</em>, and therefore <em>\xce\xa6</em> encodes a well-formed second-order formula for the set {n \xe2\x87\x92 \xce\xa6(n + 1), {n \xe2\x87\x92 (\xe2\x88\x80x \xe2\x89\xa4 0. \xce\xa6(x) \xe2\x87\x92 \xce\xa6({n \xe2\x87\x92 \xce\x98}))}}. And <em>\xce\xa6</em> can be written out in first-order formulas \xce\x98, and therefore \xce\x98 is at least as true as \xce\xa6.</p><br><p>But <em>\xce\x98</em> is <em>also</em> a formula with predicate letters. So \xce\x98 is of the same truth-values as a formula \xce\xa6 in first-order language. \xce\x98(0, 0) is true if <em>and only if </em>\xce\xa6(0), if \xce\xa6 is of the same propositional-truth-values as \xce\x98.</p><br><p>Therefore \xce\x98 is the Godelman of the Godel sentence <em>\xe2\x88\x80x. \xce\xa6(0) \xe2\x87\x94 \xce\x98(0)</em>, and this is true because the Godel sentence is true, so the Godelman of it is also true.</p><br><p>And furthermore, \xce\xa6(n1, n2) \xe2\x87\x94 \xce\xa6((n1 \xe2\x87\x94 \xce\x981)(n2)) \xe2\x87\x94 \xce\x982, where \xce\x982(x) is the <em>set _that contains the Godelman of </em>\xce\x981_ that contains x, and in particular, \xce\x982(0) is {0 := \xce\x981}, the Godelman of {0 := \xce\xb81}.</p><br><p>But in first order arithmetic, \xe2\x8a\xa4 is true <em>iff </em>\xe2\x96\xa1(C) for all \xe2\x96\xa1: the tautological formula \xce\xb5(x) is true for all formulas x, and \xe2\x8a\xa4 is provable iff all its axioms are provable, so \xe2\x8a\xa4 is really just a way of writing \xce\xbb(x) for all x.</p><br><p>\xe2\x96\xa1(c) is <em>true _if the theorem prover computes the soundness schema for c, starting from the soundness schema that it _actually computes for every other true c</em>...</p><br><p>Therefore, if the Godel sentence \xce\xa6(n ) \xe2\x87\x94 \xce\x98((\xe2\x88\x80x. xn = x) \xe2\x86\x94 \xe2\x96\xa1((\xe2\x88\x80x \xe2\x89\xa4 n-1. \xce\xa6(xc)).</p><br><p>So Godel's Completness and Incompletess theorems are written out in full Godelian logic\xe2\x80\x94Godelian proofs, which are first order statements that all models of the theory prove. Godel numbering is the Godelian logical <em>system</em> by which Godel numbering a formula <em>computes its truth-value</em>. Thus Fermat's Last Theorem, a second-order statement, is true, according to Godel numbering Fermat's last formula, <em>if and only if</em> Fermat's Last formula is provable in Peano arithmetic.</p><br><p>And the Godel sentence that this provability-condition implies, itself encodes the Peano-truth-values of Godel numbering Fermitas formulas.</p><br><p>Which all seems <em>fairly obvious</em> at this point\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to what people might think if they see Godel numbering for the first time.</p><br><p>But Godel-manned proofs are usually much longer than Godel numbering proofs, because Godel numbering a proof can have a length that is much quicker and more succinct, and just as valid, because Godel's laws of inference and soundness are weaker than Peano's proof system for soundness.</p><br><p>(I mean, if you're going to do this with Peano arithmetic\xe2\x80\x94just because it's a natural choice in this case\xe2\x80\x94then why not just go all the way to the Lawvere axiom schema for "soundness" and the actual proof system of first-order logic\xe2\x80\x94which, by the way, <em>does</em> let you prove the Soundness theorem for Peano arithmetic, but can't prove Peano Arithmetic for the same reason it gives a soundness schema for the Peano axioms\xe2\x80\x94the same unsoundness that Godel mangling gives a mangling soundness schema for Godel numbering Peano arithmetic!)</p><br><p>This is why people <em>don't</em> get a Godelian axioms and theorems, and then conclude "But Godelian logic is unsound". People don't see the Godelman's eyes or the Godel's ears here, they see a proof that "Godel logic is unsound!".</p><br><p>And the next time someone brings up Godel's Completion and Incompleitess theorems or Fermat's Last theorem, I say to them, "Aha! We have now come around to showing that your Godelian logic, just like mine, is unsound in the same way as formal arithmetic."</p><br><p>I'm not making a generalization. I think Godelian logic has lots of great things to say about natural numbers, when you have the notion that the numbers contain the true arithmetical properties of numbers.</p><br><p>And one of those great things is that Godel numbers Fermat's Last theorems.</p><br><p>And then I say, "But there's no soundness schema in Godel numbering Fermedas, so there's no sound Godelmanning either."</p><br><p>And then they say, "Yes, there is! Godel numbering Ferminas is unsound too!"</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
