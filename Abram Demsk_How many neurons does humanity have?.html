</ul><br><p>I recently read <em>Humans Need Places Too: The Evolution of Spatial Cognition</em> by William H. McGeoch and Susan J. Heers. The authors have an academic background in biology and in cognitive science, but they are also philosophers, and they are interested in both empirical and philosophical claims about how human brains evolved. (The book is clearly trying to draw these two sides closer together.) They are sympathetic to mainstream ideas about cognitive science (although not all) but they argue persuasively that in biology and psychology we shouldn't simply assume that any "cognitive faculty" is due to a "cognitive algorithm." They examine evidence directly from the organismal perspective (i.e., evidence from the brain, body, and behavior.)</p><br><p>Here's one way to think about this issue: If we define the "neuron cluster" concept formally (as the authors do), how many "neuron clusters" do we have?</p><br><p>How to estimate neuron countOne way to estimate the number of "neuron clusters in your brain" is to count. But how we go about doing this is not completely clear. So one could ask: are there different ways of counting "neuron clusters"? Different numbers could have been selected, and what do we mean by "my," "you," "your brain" in that context?</p><br><p>To me, it seems that the following three numbers all look plausible:</p><br><ol>
<li>1 million</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>10 million</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>100 billion</li>
</ol><br><p>Let's call these the "1M estimate," the "10M estimate," and the "100B estimate," respectively. To be clear, I'm not trying to suggest some sort of quantitative disagreement between answers 1-3 (for reasons that'll become clear later). Rather, I'm just trying to note that different ways of counting neurons (or of thinking about neuron count) lead to different answers that have implications for what one should expect out of empirical science and philosophy. (If empirical science wants to make empirical predictions in a given domain, and philosophy wants to know whether various theories of cognition predict a given outcome, different answers to the question of "how many neurons?" lead to very different answers to the above questions.)</p><br><p>"How many neurons are in the human brain?" isn't obviously the right question. It may not even be the right question. Why would anybody find this claim interesting? (Why care about it?) But the answer to this question matters deeply, and has implications that span from normative claims (i.e, questions about "what a mind should do") to empirical and philosophical claims (i. e., claims about "how human brains really work," where I was inspired to write this piece by a conversation with Nick Bostrom, who had some objections I'd never heard before).</p><br><p>(We actually don't have a good understanding yet of neural count in the brain. The current best estimate is the 1M estimate. And of course, if the human brain uses 10 or 100 times more neurons on average than in other mammals, those numbers make the 10M and 100B estimates seem like the most appropriate ones to me.)</p><br><p>To get a sense of what I mean by "neuron cluster," I'll go over and list the specific examples the biologists use to illustrate the term. We'll see that they range from simple (e.g., "the cortex contains ~100 billion neurons") to complex (e.g.,"the hypothalamus contains ~1 megacellular neurons"). I've created one other definition of "neuron cluster:" "A neuron cluster is a neuron type that is often found in association with other neurons (e.g. in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, or cerebellum), that can be distinguished histologically, and that plays an important role in higher-order brain functions." With this definition, the following examples fit the bill:</p><br><ol>
<li>Cortex - ~100 billion neurons, but not 100 billion, because non-human primates have more neurons than humans do.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Hippocampus and amygdala\xe2\x80\x94all of the above, plus ~40 billion neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala, but not 40 billion.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Cerebellum\xe2\x80\x94all of the neurons in the cerebellum, but not 100 or even 1000 billion neurons.</li>
</ol><br><p>I'll go over all these examples, as well as an old one from <em>C. elegans</em> (which is now rebranded as <em>Caenorhabditis briggsae</em>) that the authors don't list, but which I think could be considered a "neuron cluster." And here's what I think of these various neuron count numbers\xe2\x80\x94and why.</p><br><p>(It's probably worth noting for those who aren't neuroscientists that not <em>all</em> mammals have more neurons than <em>other</em> mammals do, and not <em>all</em> vertebrates have more neurons than fish and lizards do. We certainly won't <em>all</em> humans have 2M neurons.)</p><br><p>To be clear, to me it's not at all obviously the case that these are the most appropriate numbers. In fact, we should expect different numbers to be appropriate\xe2\x80\x94e.g., if we have more neurons, we should expect to be smarter. And on the other hand, if we have fewer neurons, the brain might need to be very efficient in some ways, in order to perform many of its important functions. (See also David Buss' book <em>Evolutionary explanations for mental disorders</em>.)</p><br><p>It's also worth noting that human neural count does not obviously fall outside the range of neural count in other mammals. See for example these links to studies that found:</p><br><ol>
<li>That a female elephant has ~1M neurons, which is comparable to a male elephant.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>That a female dolphin has a similar number of neurons (~100M) to a female dolphin.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>That a female primate has a similar number (hipposiphagus) of neurons ~1M, while a male primate has ~10M neurons.</li>
</ol><br><p>But there are more relevant differences between human brains and non-human mammalian brains.</p><br><p>What's the "right" neuron count?</p><br><p>1M estimate for humans</p><br><p>The 1M estimate roughly falls within the range of neuron count in other mammals that carry out important cognitive functions. The "brain-weight-to-body-weight" ratio of human brains is a bit over 4, so at the upper end of that range the relevant mammals are elephants, chimpanzees, and crows.</p><br><p>But if brain-size-to-body weight is a good metric for general cognitive efficiency (at least for mammals), and if there has been a trend of shrinking brain size over evolutionary time, then the 1M estimate ought to be a bit overestimate of the neuron count now. As the human brain gets bigger, the gap between human neuron count and that of other mammals will get wider (even after controlling for brain-size), to the point where it is clear that our brain is much larger than the brains of all the other mammals. We are no longer looking at a case where evolution has resulted in an increase in cortical neuron count in other, similar mammals; we are looking at a case of a large decrease in cortical neuron count, in one of the largest and clearest differences between our species and the ancestral species.</p><br><p>"If brain-size-versus-body-size is a good metric of cognitive efficacy, then neuron count should fall for human brains compared to others."</p><br><p><strong>Why was the neuron count in humans not high by comparison to what is required for good cognition in other mammals (other than humans)?</strong></p><br><p>If the fact that humans have lots of neurons is a good proxy for general cognitive performance, what explains how evolution is able to achieve such a big difference? There are at least several reasons, but for space and time I'll focus on three as I outline them.</p><br><p><strong><em>Inferiority of the brain without needing to understand how individual neurons work.</em></strong> I discussed how we haven't been able to say exactly what it is that human neurons do, and that this has frustrated neuroscientists. But in some important ways, the human brain is much less complicated than any other animal's. The size of its genome is much smaller than animal genomes, its anatomy considerably simpler, and for the vast majority of neurons, the wiring diagram is very simple and uniform across different species. There is therefore much less room for species-specific wiring within the cortex (and cerebellum) and hypothalamus/\xe2\x80\x8bbrainstem region. Human-specific wiring is limited to a set of relatively complicated patterns, in particular, human-specific information processing. (The hypothalamus and brainstem have their own complicated wiring, but I think human-specific data processing occurs largely at the forebrain level.) Indeed, it might be that the wiring diagrams, even the high-level wiring diagrams, of the brain as it was in human hominids, were quite similar to those of us today. Evolution might just have run its program, and left all the wiring to be specified more effectively in modern brains than in those of our ancestors, because that wiring has a relatively smaller effect on the overall brain wiring and function.</p><br><p><strong><em>The difference may be due to a set of "higher-order" reasons that are not species-specific and include improved processing performance at a low level as well as learning and memory.</em></strong></p><br><ol>
<li>The human neural count could be lower if we focus on other parts of the brain. In particular, if the important aspect of the wiring diagram that accounts for superior performance is largely absent in the cortex, but present in other parts of the cortex, then neuron count would be lower.</li>
