<li>Alcuin Sharkey, describing an English poem warning travelers that Scotland is on their left.</li>
</ul><br><p>Imagine a bunch of people who are trapped on an island, unable to leave. These people know two different facts about the island that most of the population doesn't.</p><br><p>The first fact: there is a volcano on the outskirts of the island that is probably about to erupt and likely will kill everyone if it does. The second fact: there is also a volcano on the other side of the island that will spew rocks and kill everyone if it erupts.</p><br><p>Now consider these people as a superorganism.</p><br><p>One way to view superorganisms is as an adaptive conflict: some factions in the group have selfish goals, and some have an altruistic goal of maximizing the fitness of the group. Sometimes there is even a third kind of faction \xe2\x80\x93 the ones who just want a simple, friendly existence, without being either selfish or altruistic. (It is even possible to have a fourth faction who just want to be left alone by the other three!)  You might be like "Oh, yeah? How do I get out of this island?" as you struggle to live your own life, without the selfish, altruistic, friendly or indifferent factions fighting you for resources \xe2\x80\x93 but this is a rather silly attitude to take. There are several reasons why you shouldn't think of it that way.  </p><br><p>The first reason is that you're very likely to be in the selfish faction (the people that want to kill you) or the altruistic faction (the people who want to protect you) in any group with three or more members.</p><br><p>But also, you're more likely to get out of a group if you're its largest and most influential faction. If the three or more factions are in a majority coalition with someone in the minority coalition, most reasonable people will see that as normal and assume that coalition is in charge even if they don't like the idea.</p><br><p>This means that a majority coalition is going to select a leader who has a chance of getting to keep them all out, and also select people who are <em>most</em> well-suited for this job. I would put a fair amount of probability on being in the selfish faction \xe2\x80\x93 I don't like being in the altruistic faction, and the friendly faction seems like the worst kind of faction because, again, I'm likely going to be killed by the selfish and altruistic factions. So the people who I would likely select for being selfish in this situation would be the most self-sacrificing people, the people who would risk their lives for others who can't save themselves, those who would not sacrifice what's theirs for what's not theirs.  (The altruistic faction's choice would be the people, like me, who would be the most likely to be able to sacrifice something to protect others.)  And the more selfish, the more willing to take risk and risk their lives, the people who have more spare resources and are therefore likely to survive and be rewarded.</p><br><p>So if this is a good description of what happens in a group that is trapped on an island with a volcano, you should reason that it explains why the group would select for people that are good at killing people. And because many people are in this group, this is a reasonable model for a social group whose members are all in some way opposed to each other.</p><br><p>But what, you may ask, does this have to do with a superorganism on that group who is trapped in their place with no way off but to coordinate to do something about it?</p><br><p>Let's take an abstract example \xe2\x80\x93 a group of people who want to form a committee to create a better world. They come up with a few candidates as possible committee members. Maybe one of them wants to work on global warming because she has an idea for a good way to solve it. Another of them is a businessman who thinks they can improve the economies in the third world by teaching people how to use computers. A third member runs a nonprofit that helps people with mental disorders. Another runs a local business and would like to donate some of his proceeds to charity.</p><br><p>Each candidate then chooses one of the above things to work on, which should be pretty transparent. The candidate who wants to work on local businesses will take care of local businesses, the politician who wants to work at the local level will also do well on the global level, and so on. Once the committee selects their candidate, the group will be much better at working on their goals than if they had chosen no member at all.  (Of course, sometimes the candidate will decide they <em>shouldn't</em> work on being the committee member. In that case, they'll probably not get off the island.)</p><br><p>Now we can turn this back on the group to explain its observed behavior. If somebody comes to the committee and says "I'm very self-sacrificial, so I should be the committee member", the committee is going to be biased in that person's favor by the fact that so many people are like them. Even the person who wants to work locally may not think being a committee member will give them any good career opportunities, but most of the time the committee <em>does</em> get things done, it's because the members select someone who can actually do good things. And there's no reason to believe the committee members have not chosen their self-sacrifice at least in part for selfish reasons.</p><br><p>But if the committee members chose at least one of them to be selfish \xe2\x80\x93 and in the committee meeting, this person who is selfish is selected \xe2\x80\x93 then the committee would presumably still end up selecting a person who is good at killing people, probably the same person they originally chose. This should be consistent with our observations. When the committee chooses from among several people, this should select someone who was already going to be a good killing person, and they then choose that person to be the final committee member.</p><br><p>You may not agree that the committee would then end up choosing to kill everyone. Perhaps the good committee members have some way of splitting the pie, and we observe that the committee chooses one over the other. Maybe in practice they split the pie as fairly as possible, and the final selection is more random and so not so biased towards self-sacrifice. But either way, the observations match our common sense about superorganisms.</p><br><p>The second reason superorganisms are a useful model is that when we observe them acting, it is almost always because they are acting on behalf of the whole group. Some example action groups who do many things for the good of the group, including keeping it off the volcano:</p><br><ul>
<li>Group leaders (e.g. the mayor of a town) and other decision-makers.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>All-weather scouts (e.g., if there's a hurricane the town may close down temporarily to protect the community).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The military (for example, in a war, troops will take action to defend themselves, usually after consulting with their commanders).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>All-purpose firefighters (e.g, in a forest fire, the fire department may try to stop the burning down of anything with value in the area before it turns into ashes).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The fire department (this is one group with a mixed evolutionary purpose: they want to protect their town from fires. Also they want to attract members who are especially self-sacriful, because this trait will help them do a better job at their main goal.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Search-and-rescue teams (e.g on accident in the woods).</li>
</ul><br><p>The problem I see with this model is that it is not very useful <em>in isolation</em>, that is, it can explain most group behaviors, but it rarely predicts group <em>failings</em>, that is why the group doesn't leave the island or die when the island sinks. One of the most common examples is an argument between two factions, and the most common outcome isn't their killing each other but a compromise with all three factions \xe2\x80\x93 this is also why most superorganisms don't have a military. Another common example is an outside factor getting in the way of the group, and if the outside factor is like "you need to leave the island", then the model doesn't say that this is what the group actually does \xe2\x80\x93 it says that the group is more concerned with maintaining its power <em>and</em> the well-being of its members.</p><br><p>I think the real problem is that the superorganism metaphor is overly anthropomorphic and shouldn't be used when talking about humans in non-anthropomorphic groups. I say this, because it looks like the superorganism model is useful for explaining human behavior in many situations where group coordination is important and where the group members are somewhat selfish. (It's also useful for explaining some animal behavior, like mating patterns.) But a superorganism is not the optimal metaphor for humans in non-superorganism groups, especially not humans in <em>all</em> of those groups. I expect that in a society of more varied, unconnected non-human individuals, the superorganism concept isn't obviously applicable at all \xe2\x80\x93 we might get a bunch of selfish individuals, who occasionally reach a superorganism consensus for some benefit, but it's far from obvious that at large society functions as one.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
