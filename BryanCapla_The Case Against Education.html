But when it comes to education, most of these blogs don't even make an effort to understand education as a whole.</p><br><p>Why aren't there blogs devoted to the education debate, or to the broader discussion of what is important in life? Is it that nobody considers either side to be especially valuable? Why aren't the majority of people concerned about education in general?</p><br><p>Let's consider education as a whole, beginning with how much value education provides.</p><br><p>How much value does schooling add?</p><br><p>I was surprised, perhaps horrified, to find so much agreement on the importance of education. Every paper I read asserted that school doesn't do much for you. The more I looked, the more sure I became of the case.</p><br><p>The reason for this consensus is simple: if school doesn't offer much value, there's no reason for it to be the most intensive. And if it's not the most intensive, we should try less intensive forms of education instead.</p><br><p>If the school system is a big waste of time and effort, why does it even exist? Why devote so many people to it?</p><br><p>Education isn't just about learning. One of the other functions of education is to create an illusion that it's possible to measure how we're doing in school. We can't, of course, but we can measure school attendance.</p><br><p><em>We don't even have the raw data on school spending. But if we did, we could see that our school system is not a big waste of money.</em></p><br><p>In other words, we have lots more educational services than we know what to do with. Just as hospitals over-staffed to produce more uselessly efficient care, schools over-staffed for educational services to produce more useless care.</p><br><p>This is not surprising. Schools are bureaucracies. The point of any bureaucracy is to produce useless care. </p><br><p>In many countries, as far the evidence goes, one in twelve students attend formal school, but one in three graduates go on to complete a higher level of education.</p><br><p>Schools mostly don't educate. Schools mostly waste time.</p><br><p>School should be about learning.</p><br><p>How do we do that?</p><br><p>The best research I found about effective teaching doesn't tell us _what _effective teaching is. It just tells us what doesn't work.</p><br><p>The first post of the sequence is a guide to teaching, based partly on the research I described in the first part.</p><br><p>A better guide to teaching is _The Art of Teaching, _by David Berlinerblau. It describes teaching through an evolutionary perspective, from the perspective of chimpanzees and humans. Teaching, and learning, have evolved over time, and continue to evolve.</p><br><p>For example, humans didn't used to teach. Chimpanzees, and other nonhuman animals, don't use oral language. (Cultural evolution, of course, requires language.)</p><br><p>In _The Case Against Educataion, _Scott describes two common arguments in favor of education:</p><br><ul>
<li>Education <em>makes you smarter.</em> The "Great Gap" theory, that most differences between groups are from IQ, is self-reinforcing. If smarter people are better at a variety of employables, then smartness at school will be associated more strongly with future IQ. And if it will make you smarter, that's great.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Education <em>helples you be more employable.</em> This argument is more complicated, and perhaps more interesting.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Education is _about _learning. So if it doesn't teach you anything, it is useless.</li>
</ul><br><p>In part, these arguments suggest that education could be much more useful than it really is. In part, I think they're wrong.</p><br><p>Scott presents two tests for <em>actual</em> education:</p><br><p>The first looks at how different countries compare in education. The second compares people who attended more-or-less the same school in two different countries, to find how the same school can perform better or worse depending on its culture and politics.</p><br><p>The question that I want to explore is: Should our education be "more about learning" \xe2\x80\x93 or should we follow _different _criteria, such as</p><br><ul>
<li>How easily do you do it?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How long do you take?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How much time do you waste on extraneous activities?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How easy is it to use what you've learned? (The more things one must know, the more learning is a negative experience.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The degree to which it is easy to evaluate how things are going?</li>
</ul><br><p>To illustrate this is difficult, I'll use an analogy. Suppose someone wants to give their child the advice of learning Spanish. They ask, "Should I talk to my child in Spanish, or try to teach them English first?"</p><br><p>My parents both taught me Spanish. I used that Spanish for five years living in Mexico, and again from 2008 to 2015 on my three jobs in the US.</p><br><p>My reaction to this question is, "No matter how much I tried to teach my child English, she would have been better off learning Spanish the first time. If I tried to teach her English earlier in life, I would have wasted years of her life.</p><br><p>If I did that because I thought English was better, I'm the same evil person as the parents in Scott's story."</p><br><p>That said, for kids, there are at least three good things about learning English. First, most English speakers live in the US or western Europe. So if I wanted my child to live anywhere else, I would have to spend more money, or travel longer distances. This isn't the case for many Spanish speakers.</p><br><p>Second, Spanish is widely use, and as a result it is more common to use English to communicate. Spanish has been losing prominence as the most commonly spoken second language, and as an increasing percentage of students go to universities where English is the lingua franca.</p><br><p>Third, Spanish may be worth learning if your job is in technology, business, or one of the other "international" specialties.</p><br><p>These are some pretty good reasons to learn Spanish. These are also reasons to learn Spanish, and to learn most other languages.</p><br><p>I wonder if the same argument could be made for English as an international language. To my knowledge, the US has no plan to enforce this, and many foreign languages remain little more than dead languages.</p><br><p>If that can't happen, _would a mandatory, formal international language really be _worse _than the current status quo?</p><br><p>Scott also discusses <em>extracurriculars</em>. The value of learning a subject in your <em>own time</em> is much weaker than learning it <em>in school.</em> Scott says he would rather do something fun than study. This is an important point, for I did the same thing.</p><br><p>I would rather play sports at a high school <em>or college</em> than do homework on a university campus. But I would rather play sports in high school and college <em>or at least a public-school-like academic environment</em> than in a private school. In other words I prefer learning in an _institutionalized _setting, and that is something I could reasonably call "extracurricular."</p><br><p>This brings me to my second point:</p><br><p><em>School is often the environment where one learns _extracurriculam.</em>"</p><br><p>A number of people have suggested creating a standardized test to determine who should and should not go to school. If we have good teachers, most people who can afford to send their kids to a good school can do quite well on the test, and won't waste an expensive year of their life. Those who would do poorly can use home schooling or other teaching by private individuals. Both groups would be better off.</p><br><p>This seems like a good compromise to me. For most people, school is the default environment where they learn. If school quality can be raised, that may be better than having more school in general.</p><br><p>What about college? Many people choose to go even though college grades aren't all that correlated with career success. Is going to college <em>less worthwhile in general?</em></p><br><p>As Scott noted, this may be the most important question.</p><br><p>It certainly is <em>worthwhile</em> trying to answer this question and answering it <em>correctly</em>.</p><br><p>The world is changing rapidly, and the next generation of graduates will learn how to get jobs much earlier than any generation before them. People graduating today will be much more employable than their generation will be.</p><br><p>If we value an average job more highly than an average degree, then our educational system has been a gigantic waste of time.</p><br><p>On the other hand, if this is the correct value view, then schools are useful. The average year of education is not <em>unnecessary</em>, it's <em>extremely useful</em>. To use Scott's terms, the Great Gap theory is wrong, and so school is highly employable.</p><br><p>This may also be the reason people who know more believe in school. People who work in education tend to believe in school. Those on the other side tend to be people who either don't want to believe or are unable to believe.</p><br><p>If Scott's position is correct, the way to improve education is to make it less stupid, more practical. Don't waste years of children's time on useless education because that's what schools are "supposed" to do. Instead, focus on the value-added of school:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
