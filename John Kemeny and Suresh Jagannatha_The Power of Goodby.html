Next in the series, we're going to look at the flip side of specificity; we're going to ask: What are some cases where good specificity fails? How do these failure modes differ, and can we use that to predict them? </p><br><p>For example, how does good specificity work in the case of goodby?</p><br><p><strong>When Specificity Works for Goodby</strong></p><br><p>We can start our examination by considering the example of goodby, as we've specified it. It has three phases: First, <strong>Specificity</strong>. Then we need to figure out <strong>what we mean by goodby</strong>. Then we want to <strong>communicate it clearly,</strong> to make <strong>other people goodby</strong>. </p><br><p>There's this great quote about goodby in which Thomas Mann said something along the lines that goodby isn't a word, it's an action. When goodby happens, it's not a statement that people can make, it's something they do. Specificity helps to ensure that people actually do what you mean by goodby, while specificity also allows them to <em>communicate</em> that they meant something, to you and others in the future.</p><br><p>We'll try to make three predictions about goodby, for each one of the three phases, in order to understand how and when each of them fail:</p><br><ul>
<li>__1. __First we'll try to understand when specificity helps. We'll predict that specific communication is <em>less</em> likely to actually cause people to be goodby. After all, if people are trying to kill you with specificity, you're already dead.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>__2. __Second, we'll try to see when specificity allows for goodby. We'll predict it'll be <em>more</em> likely to actually help people be goodby towards you, since it'll be more likely that they can communicate it unambiguously to you.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>__3. __Third, we'll try predict the most common failure mode for the first two conditions. We'll predict people's failure to be clear about what it is that they meant, or that they actually mean by the word goodby. In other words, we'll try and predict a failure to be specific, due to our tendency to <em>overgeneralize</em>. </li>
</ul><br><p>For each phase, and for each failure mode, we'll try explaining each condition in turn, leading on to examples and an explanation of how each failure mode is exemplified/\xe2\x80\x8boverlaid. </p><br><p><strong>When Specific Communication Doesn't Help</strong></p><br><p><strong>1. Goodby</strong></p><br><p>It's been noted before that specificity usually only matters in <em>dynamically</em> bad scenarios. For example, say that you and some others want to build a wall. Specific communication is likely to be useless in such a situation; all that's likely to happen is that people will misunderstand each other, and create more misunderstandings, and so on. </p><br><p>On the other hand, say that you're deciding whether you want to go to dinner that night. In this situation there's the <em>opposite</em> problem: in almost any situation, if people can communicate more clearly, it's almost always likely to create a <em>better</em> scenario. People will understand each others' intentions better, and therefore be able to coordinate better. People will have more knowledge about each other, so there will be more options available to them, and they can avoid some of the pitfalls that happen when people don't understand each others' motivations. If you like dinner, they'll be better able to coordinate, so you'll have more fun. If you don't like dinner, they'd rather coordinate not going than creating more misunderstandings. </p><br><p>So specificity does help here, in my view, because it allows you to coordinate around a specific plan for the night.</p><br><p>I want to be specific in that plan, just in case we get interrupted, or someone breaks the plan. I also want to be able to communicate in the future that I don't want to go that night, or not to a specific person, without having to explain myself again.</p><br><p><strong>2. Goodby as Goodby by Other People</strong></p><br><p>Say you are looking for a house to live in. You can communicate more clearly if you're looking for a house, and if you're looking at houses <em>specifically</em>, you can be more specific about what you like or don't like. What's true of this failure mode, however, is that most of the time when failure comes up in the first place, it's <em>because</em> people <em>weren't specific enough</em>. They wanted to help other people be goodby. What this means is that instead of thinking that specificity is helpful, we should instead think: <em>Why</em> were people trying to help, so that we can predict failure modes we care about.</p><br><p>In other words, this problem is a failure mode of <strong>thinking that you know what they'd want and they'd tell you</strong>. That's probably not the case! This mistake often manifests as:</p><br><ul>
<li>Assuming that they'd want them to do things they have no interest in Doing. </li>
</ul><br><p>For example: I say I want to go to that party, they say no, because they really don't like talking to people, what would we do if they said no, and they really <em>do</em> like talking to people.</p><br><ul>
<li>Assuming that you'd say stuff that would be an annoyance to them. </li>
</ul><br><p>For (I assume) a lot of social interaction situations, this means assuming they'd say stuff along the lines of "what is this person <em>on about</em>?"</p><br><ul>
<li>Assuming that what they say indicates what they want. </li>
</ul><br><p>For instance, assuming that they'd say they don't like broccoli because this is what they <em>do</em> like.</p><br><ul>
<li>Assuming about other people in ways that you know they wouldn't. </li>
</ul><br><p>For me, when I get caught in situations with other people, this assumption usually manifests as: </p><br><ul>
<li>They tell me they really don't want me around, and I assume this means they don't want to be around me</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They don't tell me, "we've got a problem", and I assume this is because none of them do know what they want.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They use words like "don't like me", which I assume means they'll just have the problem in a different way tomorrow</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>3. Goodby as Generalized Badby (Overgeneralizing)</strong></p><br><p>The failure that's most common is <strong>thinking that good by someone is the same as general badby</strong>. Here's a way you may fall prey to this failure mode:</p><br><ul>
<li>Imagine that someone is in a situation which has a number of possible outcomes A, B, C, and D. Say that if you do X, then outcome B will happen. Your current plan for what you should do X is vague enough, and you assume other people will also try to help you plan out what actions you should take in B.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>You think you can do X, then do B, and X still makes outcome B happen so you think you're doing fine and don't need to change your actions.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Your friends tell you "you should have prepared for B instead of X, if you actually care about X"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>You say you actually care about B and X makes outcome B so you don't need to worry about X.</li>
</ul><br><p>So now you say you actually care more about B than X does. However, if people had thought of the problem differently, you wouldn't have said "X makes outcome B so I'm actually fine". Instead, you'd see it the other way around. "X would make outcome B so I don't need to care about B" would be the correct line of reasoning. But since you started with the thinking that you cared more about B, you say it anyway.</p><br><p>So if you were more specific at the beginning, you "could" have avoided the problem.</p><br><p>This third failure mode, where "thinking that you know better than them and what they'd want" manifests, is closely related to the first failure mode I also called Goodby. </p><br><p><strong>Example of Third Failure</strong></p><br><p>Let's look at the example of the bad-pizza conundrum.</p><br><p>Say you and a friend really enjoy pizza together.</p><br><p>So you decide to go get a pizza, but your friend is feeling a bit hungry. If you're in a mood to go get a good pizza, but not so hungry that you'd be willing to go get a really expensive pizza, here's what you could do:</p><br><p>You could say "Hey, I'm feeling a bit hungry, what do you want for dinner?"</p><br><p>This gets to be a tricky problem, but that's because you aren't thinking clearly. You assumed that your friend wanted to have good pizza, which isn't true. Now you realize, you want to know whether he wants to go to a really expensive pizza restaurant, a less expensive one, or if he just wants the cheaper good pizza restaurant that you love. </p><br><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p><br><p>So I claim that the reason specificity is so helpful here, is that it opens up the possibility of communicating all this better. As you say "Hey I'm hungry, what would you like for dinner?" your friend can then more easily tell you, "I want to go get the cheap version of that fancy stuff you get at that other place," or something like that.  </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
