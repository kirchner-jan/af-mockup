</ul><br><p>I want to know about Less Wrong's demographics, but I also want to know how many people are _actually here. _You know who you are.</p><br><p>This is a two-pronged question. Is the number here that it looks like you only have 25 users? Is the number here the real one? It depends what you consider 'here.' Is SSC counting you? Is Hacker News? Does the RSS feed count you?</p><br><p>I looked at previous years' data and saw wildly diverging numbers. I looked around and couldn't find any attempt to take a count of the whole internet.</p><br><p>But, based on previous surveys that give some interesting numbers, especially of active posters, let's make our own estimates.</p><br><p>These are for people at Less Wrong who gave up their email addresses for the survey, for a total of ~140 people.</p><br><p>Before I go into the data, I want it noted up front that this survey is _very obviously not representative of Less Wrong, except in the sense that Less Wrong users have given up their email addresses. _If you have zero karma you and therefore cannot give up your email address and/\xe2\x80\x8bor can't select the 'participant' option on the survey, _please don't be fooled by this. _</p><br><p>These are the people who gave up their e-mail addresses, and then followed the simple instructions:</p><br><ul>
<li>Click here to select 'SURVEY' (or 'click here to take the survey')</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>On the next screen, where you need to write in a number, write in 4 (one survey per Google page)</li>
</ul><br><p>If you _do _understand the instructions and got to here, congratulations and thank you for taking the survey. This is a very diverse group of us, and I expect Less Wrong as a site to look very different from what the above graph represents. You should definitely not get any particular results from this group as a whole, even if you are a LW commenter.</p><br><p>I ran this survey in mid-October on the last survey data collection I had from 2018, so the response period for this survey was a full two months. It's possible this is some weird one-time effect or something.</p><br><p>One might worry that this whole thing is completely invalid. I think it's valid but probably still incomplete.</p><br><p>The Main Takeaway</p><br><p>There are almost definitely way more users.</p><br><p>The Graph Below Is Obvy Nonsense</p><br><p>This graph is an attempt to show a bunch of different categories of questions with answers in percentage form.</p><br><p>It starts at the 'no' option.</p><br><p>On question #1 I assume that every click that would have gone to the 'yes' option also got routed to the no option. So a 1% response gets cut in half. So 1-5/\xe2\x80\x8b20 = 5%.</p><br><p>For question 2 I assume it's split 50\xe2\x81\x8450 between 'yes' and 'no.'</p><br><p>For question 3 I assume everyone says 'no.'</p><br><p>For questions #4 and #5 I assume those don't count because they require you to know something. For question #4 I assume those donot vote. For #5 I assume that if someone votes it counts, but they don't select one or the other. So that's 1\xe2\x81\x844 chance of voting and a 2\xe2\x81\x844 chance not voting.</p><br><p>For #6 the exact question wording (without 'or') would matter a lot, but I assume everyone answered the question at least that the others had answered and at least as many times as they didn't answer. So maybe that's 1\xe2\x81\x9716 of respondents, or a ratio of 20:1, or an average of a ratio of 2:1. For question #7 if you don't have an account and select 'no' (option 3) I assume that includes you.</p><br><p>For question #8 I assumed 50\xe2\x81\x8450 but I don't think it's right to assume the ratio doesn't shift for survey respondents who know about Less Wrong but haven't made the effort to register. I presume they have a bunch of other responses we should be more interested in, but it's probably not too far from 50\xe2\x81\x8450 either. So I'll assume the ratio is 20:1 and use that.</p><br><p>For questions #10-#13 I assume a ratio of 1:1 because I think the difference between a 'no' plus a'maybe' or a 'yes and occasionally' is minimal. So if we split the groups into 'no' plus 'yes+' and 'yes only' then I'll divide the responses equally among the two groups.</p><br><p>For 13 I'm curious what would happen if I asked you to rate the quality of your life each time you post a comment, instead of asking you 'once per week.' I'm guessing this would be pretty weird, and it mostly doesn't shift the ratio, but it's a simple question, so maybe I'll just count that as 'yes, frequently.'</p><br><p>For 14 I ask all non-accounts one 'yes' to represent their agreement with Less Wrong content and 1 'yes' to their liking of the site. For this one I assume that most people say both, but we can cut off from people who say 'no' for people who say 'yes' so that's 3:1 instead of 1:1. After that I divide that into 'yes I think it's awesome' (to 4) and 'no I don't think so' (which gets split to 2 and 1 between agree and disagree, so I would say an even split at about the 60th percentile rate). For those who say 'yes I think so' but also don't say they 'like it' I assume that means 80% of people who say 'I don't like it' say 'no I don' and 20% get bumped down 20% to 80%. So I'd say that's a ratio of 50:1.</p><br><p>For 15, the ratio should be _very close _to 50:1 because the survey asked 'How likely are you to be willing to donate money to support the site?' which is almost the exact same question but with 'Less Wrong' instead of 'the site' in front, so if you say 'not very' you also say 'not at all.' For 16 it's because I feel like we shouldn't try to guess what the ratios are with so few responses, but my best guess is 50:1 so if it says &lt;50 I split'maybe' so it's 50:50. I haven't checked if I did that if I misread anywhere or there was a typo, and if not, well then I'm an idiot.</p><br><p>For 17 I think it should be close to 50:1 for the same reason as 16, and I'm curious to see how many people say 'yes, but only sometimes.' That would surprise me but I'm going to pretend it does. It's definitely not a big impact.</p><br><p>For 18 I think it should not matter all that much. It's like 10 questions of this type or something. Mostly the ratio is 'I use it' to 4:1 or something, and it doesn't matter what order I ask them because there will be a good chance that for some people either one of the three most recent questions has been 'what do you use' and for other people the three most recent are for 'how many posts?' so it's probably a rounding error even if it's not. It feels like a waste of a survey question to put it in front, but maybe I'm wrong and the surveys with it outnumber any without because no one without asks any 'how many posts' questions.</p><br><p>For 19 and #20 I think the ratio is 1:1 because 'I use it frequently' is 'yes of the last three questions' which is 'the three most recent' and the last three questions are 'how many posts?', and 'the first one of the last three' being about how many posts someone reads and not for the number of sites they're a member of. So it should go to 'the first of the last three.'</p><br><p>For #21 I think there is almost definitely some effect on it, in that a lot more people should take the survey than do, so I'm more interested in asking the ratio of 'I use it once or less than once a week', so I ask that one first since most people will only answer one or two. Then I'll ask the other ones as appropriate.</p><br><p>For 24% I think I should ask about the ratio of people who have an account versus the total number of survey respondents. For #25 it's a rounding error, but that's what I'm calling the 'total number of survey respondents' so that doesn't change things.</p><br><p>For 26 and the rest of the questions I'll assume that it's 1:1. I guess if a number isn't one then something else is going on, but all these ratios are pretty small, and rounding seems fine.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
