That we're <em>dramatically underestimating</em> the amount of human ingenuity at play in the world.</p><br><p>You're a human trying to achieve some objective.</p><br><p>A few math bits make it much easier to achieve. But not much \xe2\x80\x93 the math bits are a small fraction of what's needed.</p><br><p>To be fair (and you probably aren't being unfair, but I'm just being brutally honest here) people in the world are doing an <em>enormous</em> amount of hard work that could lead to a massive boost in the quality of their lives and the lives of their loved ones.</p><br><p>And people in the world do things even when nobody else is watching them.</p><br><p>That sounds like a nice thought.</p><br><p>Or a nice fantasy.</p><br><p>Like any fantasy, it might come true.</p><br><p>I do not think this is at all likely.</p><br><p>But I still think it's a true principle. Sometimes, there's math that's easier than it looks to humans. Sometimes humans have been _very _bad at doing it.</p><br><p>And also sometimes math is <em>just really important</em>.</p><br><p>I'm talking here about math that will improve our understanding and decisions, and hopefully in the long run help us achieve better world objectives.</p><br><p>And sometimes math helps us reach an _ideal _worldobjective without any real math \xe2\x80\x93 e.g. figuring out how to optimize a corporation without having any idea what the objectives are.</p><br><p>I find it helpful to picture mathematical aid bouncers \xe2\x80\x93 devices which stand in the way of people doing math and say "It'll be hard, but we can do it".</p><br><p>Some math bouncers are things you can see to the left of and behind you, that we can see to the right of and in front of us.</p><br><p>Other bouncers are things that stand right in front of you that you can only see to the left.</p><br><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>"If you don't have a university background, you'll be unable to do hard math stuff for a long time."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This is a bouncer you can see to your right. You should also know that this is false \xe2\x80\x93 even if you don't have the time to go to university you are able to do hard math.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Incentives:</strong></p><br><p>It's a weird one, but on the right of your math bouncers are the things you have an incentive to do. It's not that the reward is so good that you'll do it regardless, but it's good at creating the expectation that the reward will be there. So, I think it matters that your math bouncers look like an incentive.</p><br><p><strong>Math:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>Some math is really cool and interesting even if you don;t care about being a mathematician or you don't go to university. Like, understanding how to use calculus is cool even if you never use it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Other math is _really useful _even if you never read an academic paper to know what it's about. Like, having some understanding of physics just makes life generally better.</li>
</ul><br><p>There's an implicit claim between these two points: that a lot of math is _mostly _useless.</p><br><p>But the thing with math is that, if you have some mathematical skill, you should try to practice that skill.</p><br><p>If I'm going to write an essay about an apple, it will make sure to be about apples.</p><br><p>Same for math.</p><br><p>It's not that we think math has no value \xe2\x80\x93 it has _lots _of value in the world. And if you want to achieve something really awesome, it's useful to know a lot about the math.</p><br><p>Which means that most of the time, we want bouncers like "It'll be really hard, but you can get it" rather than "You'll never learn to do math at all".</p><br><p>I guess where I think this post is important is that:</p><br><ul>
<li>I think being really good at physics makes people enjoy physics more.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I think people often have math bouncers that say something like "you have this big blind spot in the world of mathematics that is really great but really hard to fix", and these people _also _have math bouncers like "if you don't have an undergraduate mathematics background, you'll never get it".</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I think a lot of people have lots of math bouncers which are more like 'you could never get it', but I think ignoring this and believing that they will, makes them less likely to practice. If you can ignore one of your math bouncer, why not the other.</li>
</ul><br><p>I'm not sure that's right, or that this is the right way to think about it, but I feel like thinking about it this way makes it clear you're making a choice about whether or not to practice a math skill.</p><br><p>It's not like everyone is getting to choose what to practice. Maybe some people aren't good enough at physics to use it in a useful way, but there are plenty of people who are. And if you can't make these decisions, then it's plausible that you're choosing to take risks of your own.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
