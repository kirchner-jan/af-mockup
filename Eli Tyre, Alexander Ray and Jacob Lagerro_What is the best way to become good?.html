<li>Science education is not just for people in science professions.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>And the best way to learn that field is by doing it?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>But is that the best way to do science research? What do you think the most efficient education system is?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'm looking for thoughts from LW's collective wisdom. Advice from your life.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Summary:</li>
</ul><br><p>What I wrote above is a summary of the answers I already gave on the Facebook discussion group. We asked these questions:</p><br><ul>
<li>What is the best science education you've ever had?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How quickly did it help you grow as a scientist? (How good or bad are different learning experiences as measured over a 10 year period?)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are the core skills you think form the most scientific knowledge and how can you most efficiently become an expert in those skills?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are essential life classes to be maximally efficient in?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How much of what I do in my blog posts are exercises in learning the material?</li>
</ul><br><p>The answers are here.</p><br><p>The first two questions have prompted this post; the 3rd, 4th and 5th are a request for LW's collective wisdom on what seems to be a common question.</p><br><p>If you comment on this post and your reply is the top voted reply, and in particular, you have a different answer than the one that people here answered, I'd like to know that!</p><br><p>What is the best education you've ever <em>taken</em>?</p><br><p>My high school education was nothing like what you might have experienced. My parents are religious (and devout), which may account for why we were able to afford a good teacher.</p><br><p>The year that I finished high school, I spent the summer visiting the Soviet Union, and my teacher at the time got us invited to see the top Russian math Olympiads from that year.</p><br><p>It was amazing! The best team wasn't as good, but there was nobody who could do the things that the top three Soviet math olympiads did. The guy who won that year was a little likelier to be an underdog by definition, but he still won.</p><br><p>The reason I won't name the others I saw was that the competition was so tight...</p><br><p>In any case, this was one of the best lessons I've ever experienced on the way to becoming a great scientist. I think it gave me more of a visceral understanding of how the great scientific olympiads are run.</p><br><p>On the academic end, I think that this experience was great. It was interesting enough to be worth my time, and it taught me a lot about how to do good math.</p><br><p>But I don't really consider myself to have finished high school until I've mastered the material to the point where I can do math problems the way they look on the tests. The tests are pretty much the same as the math problems of the physics olympiads. Physics is hard in a very real sense, it was hard to get it, and it was hard to stay on top of it. But I feel that I have a fair shot at answering the physics problems on the state tests.</p><br><p>I think that calculus comes close to understanding the material on a visceral level, and calculus is the class I think to study next in order to get better at physics. So I did go to 2 years of calculus. I don't think that I have a natural instinct for physics. I think that I'd like to become really good at doing physics research, and to be able to do research as a hobby. That requires knowing some basic physics, but more than that, calculus helps in building mathematical intuition. I think that if I study just calculus, I won't be ready for an _awful _amount of research for physics. I've been doing some physics research; it's basically a hobby; but I think I'd feel more in my body the skill of it and also have a better feel of how the material connects.</p><br><p>That said, at the moment, I'm leaning heavily towards focusing on chemistry and biology for my undergraduate degree. I think that chemistry and biology have the greatest potential for making me a better physics or math researcher.</p><br><p>College-level science, <em>how well</em>, and <em>how</em>?</p><br><p>Doing college-level science correctly is hard because it is a trade off between two different goals. First you need to learn the specific material. Second you need to <em>learn the math well enough to answer questions like, can this be proved or refuted?</em></p><br><p>The two goals are not in conflict, but they are more like goals with a tradeoff. The more you learn the specific material, and the better you are able to answer questions like can this be proved/\xe2\x80\x8brefuted, the harder it is to progress towards being able to study the math well enough that answering questions like can this happen as a "hobby".</p><br><p>My general plan, assuming that I don't take an unusual path, is to study basic material (calculus and statistics), learn the math well enough, and then focus on doing physics research and/\xe2\x80\x8bor math research as a hobby until I am very good at answering questions about physics and math, and have some other personal need of my own that I have as a hobby.</p><br><p>That said the tradeoff depends a lot on how fast I want to improve. I could easily spend a lot of time doing physics first and then learning advanced math, and then getting into doing research.</p><br><p>Does calculus, statistics, <em>or</em> other math build intuition well enough for the specific problems that need to be answered in physics?</p><br><p>Theoretically, it should. But practically, it looks like the skill of doing calculus or statistics is something which is very dependent on how one is already structured and primed to study mathematics, and I don't think I have a good sense of whether or not that's the case.</p><br><p>What courses and books should _I _take and read? [2/\xe2\x80\x8b22/\xe2\x80\x8b25]</p><br><p>I expect that the best advice is always to figure out what you want to learn and do that. I'm interested in physics research, physics, and math research in particular.</p><br><p>There's a lot to gain from specialization in physics. Studying the specific material on one's own takes work, but it allows you to have some idea of what you understand and what you need to learn. Studying calculus has its good points, and a very _somewhat _positive return, but if I can study calculus in the context of physics, it increases the return by orders of magnitude (in time, learning, and ultimately with respect to being a researcher).</p><br><p>What courses should I take? (I want an undergraduate degree, a graduate <em>degree</em>, and I want <em>more than one</em> of them.)</p><br><p>Which college course should I take?</p><br><p>It looks to me like the most important factor for the sort of education you'll get at a college is how much you personally enjoy the course.</p><br><p>Some courses are taught well and other courses are not. So, a good way to determine which courses are good to take, is try them! Don't be afraid to have an opinion? What would happen if you had an opinion? That's how you can learn, after all.</p><br><p>A good reason not to take a course is if it sounds really, really dull and boring.</p><br><p>A good way to learn what other courses <em>are</em> worth taking, is to ask people who know more than you do, <em>who like doing the specific topic</em>. Don't be hesitant about that. Ask. Learn what the best courses are on the topic you want to learn most about.</p><br><p>My personal sense is that the way in which the best education happens, as opposed to one or two classes that really help you progress, is in the context of a <em>deeply embedded, daily</em> student of the material. At my school, we had four classes each period, one for each main field of study. They went like four-hour-long lectures. I felt that they were an efficient use of time, but that it didn't leave time that I could afford to study things deeply.</p><br><p>I also think that there are some classes which are _especially _worth learning in the context of math and physics, and that doing them in the context of science gives you a better sense of what they are like. I'm not sure that the best learning from those classes happens during lecture or in the class, though. It's more in the doing.</p><br><p>My overall sense is that for what I want to do, a lot of classes might <em>work, _but not as the main component of the degree. Maybe most of the degree is making sure you actually understand the material. If _you</em> like the material, that will help.</p><br><p>There are a few classes that are very worthwhile. One is statistics. Another is math problem solving.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
