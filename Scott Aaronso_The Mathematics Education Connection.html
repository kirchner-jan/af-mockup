Please forgive the lengthy introduction\xe2\x80\x94I'd like to be able to <em>finish</em> writing this without having to rewind back.</p><br><p>I would say that computer science education primarily is concerned with the problem of how, given an application built using algorithms and data structures, one can <em>explain to someone else</em> what algorithms and data structures are being used. This problem does not arise solely in computer science\xe2\x80\x94there are numerous places throughout the mathematical literature where this problem arises outside of computer science. However, the importance of this problem in teaching computer science gives it a lot of traction in teaching mathematics education.</p><br><p>That being said, the problem is not unique to computer science. In a way, it's the essence of <em>computer science. _This problem is so central to the definition of computer science that almost nobody in the field actually thinks of it as _outside</em> computer science (especially not undergraduate students), but it's a very real question of educational relevance in its own right.</p><br><p>I hope to address this in a few later posts, but for now I'll just note that the problem is <em>fundamentally</em> tied up with the problem of <em>learning what</em> mathematics "is". A field which successfully grapples with this question will, I think, do a lot to combat the mathematical illiteracy of the population at large, both by raising the sanity waterline and by preventing mathematicians from making <em>mistaken</em> conjectures about the nature of mathematics or the proper role of education in teaching it.</p><br><p><em>This is the title of the post, and you should read all the following.</em></p><br><p><strong>1.</strong> There is a lot of confusion in the mathematics education community about what exactly (mathematical) education ought to be <em>for</em>. What is the student's goal? What kind of education process is best equipped to achieve that goal? One prominent view of the latter is that it ought to focus on teaching one to <em>teach</em>. After all, teaching is part of the process that <em>actually</em> does the learning.</p><br><p>I think there's some truth to that view. However, I also agree with Abram Demski, who said in a recent conversation:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The goal here in the mathematical field is not just to teach, but to teach to <em>learn</em>. To teach to <em>make more mathematical knowledge</em>, from the student's <em>own</em> point of view... We want the student to be thinking about mathematical problems, and we're not just <em>helping</em> him, but rather, helping him to be one who is thinking about things.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>This is a very demanding goal. It is not enough to only be able to "teach" a given subject to an elementary student (because we want him to become a mathematical artist)... I can help an elementary student to start thinking about an area of mathematics, but I actually have to push him toward a field of mathematics; I've got to show him what's out there and what's been done in the field, especially if I want him to think of new ideas.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This does suggest a different and perhaps more ambitious goal for mathematics education: actually create an end goal which would allow the learner to start thinking of mathematical conjectures on his own, and which would also make it <em>easier</em> for him to find his way into the field:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>The learner should be thinking about mathematical conjectures at all on his own. After all, mathematical conjectures are all part of the problem.</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>The learner should also not feel discouraged at all times. Mathematics often leads at the start to a sense of ennui: it's an <em>infinite</em> subject, and so it seems to lead to an endless series of problems and solutions (and also, of course, questions and answers). However, it does lead by and large to useful results: if a mathematical problem was unsolved for a long time, the person who solved it would get a lot of kudos. This leads to a feeling of satisfaction that makes mathematics more interesting and more fun.</p><br><ul>
<li>If the learner <em>does</em> start to feel like that, it shouldn't deter him from starting on problems\xe2\x80\x94only let him see more clearly how much work he's in for.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>However, the overall process of trying to get <em>new ideas _has to _precede _the overall process of finding _solutions</em> to problems. In this sense, the problem of learning to teach mathematics differs from the problem of actually learning mathematics itself.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This is especially important when we talk about the problem of learning how to explain what mathematics is. As I will later argue, this problem is also quite closely related to the problem of teaching computer science.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>2.</strong> <em>There is no contradiction between wanting to teach one subject, and being able to do so using other subjects.</em></p><br><p>In fact, often <em>using other subjects</em> will be the best thing to do.</p><br><p>I used to teach a fair amount of mathematics to undergraduates, but what always struck me was how <em>little</em> the subject "mathematical logic" taught me about how mathematics worked, and how much was taught by having students study mathematical logic. There's a lot you do <em>by following the axioms</em> of a logic, but less you <em>understand _how the axioms follow one from another. Similarly, there's a lot you can "figure out" if you understand the structure of certain proofs, but much less you can "figure it out" using a different formal logic. (If you can find a book like _A Human's Guide To Words</em>, <em>Principia Mathematica__,</em> and <em>Elements of Mathematical Set Theory__, it will probably give you a better idea of this than the vast majority of introductory logics textbooks (e.g. I would suggest using _Model Theory</em> by Chang and Keisler instead of <em>Model Theory</em> and <em>Introduction to Mathematical Arguments</em> by L\xc3\xb6b)).</p><br><p>The problem of <em>teaching to learn</em> in mathematics is very closely tied to the problem of <em>teach mathematics</em>: the former is a subset of the latter. <em>Learning calculus using _Foo_is no better than learning it _directly</em> in_ Foo_.</p><br><p>The same applies to computer science. Again, <em>using</em> computer science would be no worse than <em>learning it in its original form</em> (i.e. the "language of thought" rather than the "language of assembly"). Unfortunately, people often conflate the two issues. For example, if you want to do computer science as a career, it's often suggested that you should learn computer science <em>directly</em> using the language of thought. This would be very nice, but unfortunately, in my experience, <em>all the actual skills taught in computer science courses</em> are taught by having students learn the "language of computation" using the <em>language of assembly</em> rather than by learning the actual computer science directly. (I've personally heard the following joke: "If programming were taught directly, we wouldn't need <em>Computer Science</em>".)</p><br><p>So\xe2\x80\x94given that a significant amount of teaching is achieved by using other, non-computational subjects, what are other ways of achieving this end?</p><br><p><em>Aside: _It should be mentioned that the question of mathematics education is closely related to that of mathematics _training</em>: one of the main goals of mathematical education is to teach <em>mathematical skill</em>, and it would be very desirable to improve one's ability to "teach maths". For example, in the UK we would love to see the creation of "teaching assistants" who are certified to do first-year university classes and thus spend a few years learning the maths required, then do their first year undergrad before returning to teaching. So it's worth looking at some suggestions which have already been made regarding possible approaches to the former problem, and seeing if we can get traction on the latter <em>also</em>.</p><br><p>One possible approach here is the <em>MathPath model</em> developed by John Kounios and Mark Beeman at UC Berkeley, as well as Mark Beeman (of course he should be the main person mentioned in that connection), the authors of the book with the same name\xe2\x80\x94see, e.g. the discussion here. As discussed in the book:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>We use mathematics for building models, for planning projects, for reasoning about a broad variety of topics in business, economics, government, the humanities, and other fields. In these ways we are all mathematicians. We're interested in mathematical thinking, how to think about things mathematically, and how to get better at it.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>_This book has been recommended by a number of people on less wrong, and I recommend it strongly. _The authors describe the basics of their model in the book (which is quite long and involved), but have written up a more concise one-page version of the model here.</p><br><p>A large part of the MathPath model involves the following:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
