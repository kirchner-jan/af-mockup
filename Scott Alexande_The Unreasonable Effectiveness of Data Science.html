It's been coming in one piece, ever since I started getting into the nitty-gritty of statistical inference in grad school.</p><br><p>It's not that I have any problem with that.</p><br><p>Part of it is that it's hard to admit this out loud – let alone as part of the "nitty-gritty" – and not sound sort of like one of those science-denying creationists. Not to mention it's an admission of defeat in light of the way everything in modern academia is so ridiculously quantitative.</p><br><p>But I think it's also an <em>important</em> admission of defeat. After all these studies and papers, this "data science is everything" mantra, the increasing dominance of big data, the increasing emphasis on predictive models, and the decreasing place for the messy, human, idiosyncratic part of science – I want to say "Okay, that could also be you some day."</p><br><p>And maybe I should. After all, even if it all turns out to be just a fad, it was nice while it lasted.</p><br><p>But the data keeps piling up, and the fad doesn't seem to end. Predictive text analysis is being deployed by the CIA. Predictive brain scans can diagnose Alzheimer's disease with ~80% accuracy. Predictive personality tests can estimate personality type with near-perfect precision (but will they get you laid or something?). Predictive drug trials show promise that they'll be about as effective in saving lives as traditional trials, so pharmaceutical companies can skip all the boring human trials. Predictive policing can reduce crime and improve public safety. And so on. No field of science seems immune to this fad – even anthropology has gotten into the act.</p><br><p>If I want to be pessimistic, I can come up with an even longer list of these fields: psychology, economics, sociology, political science, international relations, and a thousand other sciences and sub-sciences. And if you want to go even more meta, I can come back and say "Anything with quantitative data" or "Anything with predictive models" or "Anything based on data mining".</p><br><p>Even if you think the problem is the data, rather than the use of data, you'll probably find it pretty hard to think of much-respected fields within which data and models are used in a sensible fashion. This was the main thrust of my post on the Overton window. For example, take psychiatry: I have no problem with psychiatry using quantitative data, or predictive models, or data mining, as long as they're used in a <em>reasonable</em> fashion. But the people in charge of it seem to have decided to think <em>that's</em> reasonable, and it's never crossed their minds that maybe they shouldn't.</p><br><p>A few years ago, I was at a cocktail party with some of the top data scientists in Silicon Valley. We were all talking like: "Oh, no, it's a data science problem. We don't really _know _anything about the human conditions underlying the data," or "There's all this data out there, but you just can't make any money out of it," or "We've got all this great data, but it's very hard to make it do anything besides look at data."</p><br><p>Then I realized the data scientists weren't talking to each other: One group was saying "Don't look at the data, it's too messy" and the other group was saying "The data's so neat, look at it!"</p><br><p>And I wondered: which of these groups did <em>they _want to be in? Which of these groups are they _currently</em> in?</p><br><p>The best predictive brain imaging technology available these days works something like this. You show up at the lab and the technician takes an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging, ie X-ray) of your brain and your head. This is called a T1-weighted image. In a very boring way, it's just a big image of a brain and everything in it. The technician then uses fancy software to turn the image into various different colors, each one representing a different "feature" of the brain. Maybe one part of the brain lights up when you see a word you like and another part lights up when you think about putting the dishes on the dishwasher.</p><br><p>Now we've got all this different colored lights going around, like the internet. All set to light up in all kinds of interesting ways for all kinds of purposes. <em>Of course</em> there's a good chance that if we stare at the light show long enough, we can infer a whole new set of things about you.</p><br><p>To be very clear about this point, I am not making the "we just use a bunch of really complicated math to crunch the data and see what happens" argument. I mean I'm against that, and I think a lot of people are wrong on this point, but we don't seem to be having that discussion right now.</p><br><p>(I will be getting to that in future posts, I promise!)</p><br><p>No. If you're using the T1 magnetic resonance imaging technology to study the brain, there is no good, easy, free, fun way to not have any data.</p><br><p>If you want more than one of the colored lights in the image to light up, then you can turn yourself into a pretty decent predictor of some human behavioral or psychological traits.</p><br><p>But that's it. More than one light might light up together, and that's usually some indication that these traits are correlated to some degree, but usually we won't be able to say much about any one of them on its own. There are some people who claim this kind of thing allows you to identify things like personality types or "spirituality", but that's not something most scientists really think about.</p><br><p>So basically, you've got T1-weight MRI light-up-this-one-part-of-your-brain correlates-well-with-some-human-behavior. Or, less often, T1-weight magnetic resonance immune-light-up-this other-part-of your-brain-correlates-well-with some trait that was hard to find or measure in the first place.</p><br><p>This sort of thing doesn't seem to have happened except by accident on a couple of rare occasions. Most famously, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman accidentally came up with the idea of "taste" in psychology by looking at people's MRI and noticing which regions lit up when they were trying to eat a cookie and which ones lit up when they thought about putting the cookie under their tongue.  </p><br><p>If you are one of the people who thinks it's important to avoid giving human beings "data" that are messy or hard to get perfect measurements out of, I'm afraid you're wrong. There's no quick and easy way around it.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
