<p>"The mathematical method," as I like to explain it, "is the study of the fallacies and fallacies of belief."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>\xe2\x80\x94Rene Descartes</p><br><p>When one is constructing a proof, you must first <em>choose</em> which proof to construct...</p><br><p>If you are dealing with an unknown statement involving <em>numbers</em>, then this usually takes you four or five steps; and you start by picking a particular element <em>a</em>, such that <em>a</em> \xe2\x89\xa0 0. Then you find a second element, such that <em>b</em> = <em>a</em> /\xe2\x80\x8b <em>n</em>. Then you find an element <em>c</em> such that <em>c</em>^2 - <em>a</em>^2 = <em>a</em>^4 - <em>b</em>^2, where <em>c</em> is rational, and so on. Then, when you have constructed <em>n</em> <em>n</em> elements of <em>a</em>, and <em>c</em>, and <em>b</em> = (sqrt(5) + 1) * <em>a</em>/\xe2\x80\x8b2, you can conclude that <em>a</em> = 2 * sqrt(5).</p><br><p>Once it's clear that you'll use the Pythagorean theorem to get the square root of 13 as the hypotenuse, the next step is to choose an imaginary right triangle with hypotenuse of 13 and legs of 5 and 7. This is done by solving the differential equation, which requires <em>c</em> = 2 * (1 + sqrt(13)).</p><br><p>Once you have an imaginary right triangle, the next logical step is to choose a complex number <em>p</em> = 14 * 3^(1/\xe2\x80\x8b4) (it may be easier to check that this is the only integer <em>p</em> which works), so that 5 ^ (1/\xe2\x80\x8b4) = <em>p</em> * sqrt(13).  Then at long last you get your <em>n</em> <em>c</em>^(<em>n</em> + 1) = (2 * sqrt(2)) * (4 * sqrt(7)), and then you compute the square root of 2, with <em>c</em> = sqrt(2), to get <em>a</em> = sqrt[2 * sqrt].</p><br><p>The first two steps, <em>a</em> \xe2\x89\xaa 0 and <em>b</em> \xe2\x89\xa0 0, are required, and all others are optional. You might begin, for instance, by picking some prime factor <em>f</em> of the product <em>ca</em>.  If you can see that <em>c</em> &gt; 0 and <em>a</em> &gt; 0, then you can assume as in the example above that <em>c</em> is odd.  (This step is often called <em>normalization</em>.)  You can pick <em>b</em> to be arbitrary, and still prove the Pythagorean law <em>b</em>^<em>2</em> + <em>c</em>^<em>2 = _a^2</em>.  (This is sometimes called <em>simplification</em>, and it may be omitted, if convenient.)  But by far the most important step in constructing the Pythagorean Theorem, is choosing <em>p</em> and <em>a</em>.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>All the steps are steps, but not all steps are alike.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>\xe2\x80\x94Theodore Vail</p><br><p>Once you have picked a particular <em>a</em>, you must <em>choose</em> whether <em>a</em> &lt; <em>n</em> or not\xe2\x80\x94_a_ cannot be both less than <em>n</em> and greater than 0 at the same time, and so this step has 1 (one) of 2 (two) possible values. By far the most common mistake is to pick the wrong value, i.e. to pick a <em>f</em> that can't even be prime.  (If you choose too large a value for <em>a</em> or not large enough a value for <em>f</em>, or choose a value for which a nonstandard division algorithm exists, then you'll end up back in the "too large" branch; this shows the usefulness of such steps.)  You can't even make a mistake in your choice at this point\xe2\x80\x94_a_ has been picked, so clearly it was legitimate as a candidate. And once <em>a</em> has been chosen, the next step requires choosing a <em>c</em> which is rational (as in the example at the beginning of the post where <em>c</em> was chosen by trying many such <em>c</em> in different ways).  Once <em>c</em> has been chosen this step is valid.</p><br><p>Once <em>a</em> has <em>c</em> chosen, the next branch of the proof requires choosing a <em>b</em>.  This step is valid, so long as you don't already know what <em>c</em> or <em>b _is. Once _b</em> is chosen, the next branching has to be decided\xe2\x80\x94it has two valid choices, one for <em>n</em> and one for <em>f</em>. And then you can calculate <em>p</em> and hence <em>a</em> if you'd like, using standard division algorithms with a chosen divisor <em>f</em>.  This last step is valid; as soon as the <em>n</em> is known, the <em>c</em> and <em>b</em> are known.</p><br><p>If, for instance, you go back and choose <em>a</em>, then <em>b</em> to make <em>c </em>(in the example above, <em>c</em> was 4), but then you go wrong and pick a <em>f _that's more than a prime factor, that makes for a bad division algorithm, then you're back in the "not _a</em> or too large a value" branch.</p><br><p>If you choose <em>n _that is "small enough to be prime", then _c</em> will be small and <em>a</em> will be large. If <em>f</em> = 7, then this yields the <em>a</em> of the right triangle I gave above.  (This choice corresponds to the example at the end of the previous post about how to check a particular real number is zero.)  If <em>f _is not prime, then you're forced back in the "I chose a value for _c</em> and it was too large" branch, or else you could have chosen a different value for _a _while remaining in the same branch...</p><br><p>In mathematics, <em>validity</em> is what is truly important\xe2\x80\x94the <em>laws</em> of mathematics are merely <em>conclusions</em> that are proved from the axioms. To be valid:  <em>a</em> \xe2\x89\x88 <em>b</em> is a much less strong statement, and can be disproven by looking for <em>m</em> such that <em>b _ is too large by a factor of _e</em> or more. But <em>a</em> \xe2\x89\xab <em>b</em> is more likely to be true.</p><br><blockquote>
