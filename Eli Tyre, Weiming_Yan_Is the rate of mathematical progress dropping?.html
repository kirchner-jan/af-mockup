(It's perfectly possible that global internet communications accelerate the rate at which _some _fields of science develop, while they slow down the rate at which mathematical progress develops. And indeed, I think that's probably what's going on \xe2\x80\x93 at least one _some _of the time, if not all the time.)</p><br><p>What would this acceleration look like?</p><br><p>What would we <em>see</em>, if the rate of progress in mathematics was accelerating?</p><br><p>In my best guess, it would look something like:</p><br><ul>
<li>The rate of progress in fields like computer science, cryptography, and AI, are going up at a much faster rate than mathematics/\xe2\x80\x8balgorithms were a couple of decades ago. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>AI researchers are able to solve problems that are harder, faster, and more reliably than researchers were able to two decades ago.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>More and more work is happening on problems that seem to <em>require</em> the sort of insights that we didn't have two decades ago. As a result, the average time for an AI problem to be solved has been cut in half or more by now.</li>
</ul><br><p>Here's a piece which makes such an argument, in the context of AI, at a higher level:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>[Toward More General Human Intelligence] is a long-range project: We believe that a system that emulates [specific, narrow] human intelligence is probably unnecessary to achieve [the specific, narrow] objective of creating a smarter-than-human intelligence, because we think emulating intelligence is probably a lot easier than designing new intelligence. So we expect that we'll probably work on [toward more general human intelligence] before having to deal with any problems of designing smarter than human intelligence.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I think that you would definitely see acceleration in the field of AI (and also see acceleration in robotics, automation, and so on), and you would _also _see acceleration in the field/\xe2\x80\x8bfields closest to maths but with respect to other fields.</p><br><p>At the end of the day, when you add up all the various accelerations, you should expect an acceleration in maths, but _also _accelerations in the field/\xe2\x80\x8bdomains that are most like maths.</p><br><p>What about the claims that I've brought up in the last year?</p><br><p>I believe one of the reasons you might expect the world to be getting more slower, with a <em>relative</em> and <em>absolute</em> slowdown in mathematics, is that some people are arguing that we should do STEM now more than it was getting done in pre-1900s. Specifically, they think it's too late for STEM to get a high percentage of the world's economic growth, in the next 2-10 years.  (I know that this sounds crazy to a lot of LW readers, but I do sometimes experience the feeling that people on LW don't think the world is getting faster, if they live in "first-world" countries, which a bunch of EAs do.)</p><br><p>When talking about this, I often hear the claim that mathematics is too easy an area to contribute to STEM. But it really seems like many such interventions would be _easier _for most people now, with the benefit of decades of work on the problem. It will be easier for smart, hard-working people to get into AI/\xe2\x80\x8brobotics/\xe2\x80\x8bwebdev/\xe2\x80\x8betc than it is for them to get into math today. And this seems like an obvious argument in favor of making it easier for people to get into STEM in general, rather than harder.</p><br><p>So I think that's one of the claims that these people, in my experience, tend to make, but I really don't think it's a reasonable claim to make after looking at the above pictures.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I think that what we're going to see is a <em>relative</em> slowdown. There weren't some crazy advances in math that occurred 10 years ago and now they're all just getting slower. Instead, it's just that the <em>rate</em> at which people are progressing in areas like robotics and AI and genetic engineering is <em>accelerating</em> relative to <em>rate</em> of mathematical progress.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>\xe2\x80\x94 Paul Christiano</p><br><p>And if you take account of that, you don't need to have the world any <em>slower</em> in order to think that mathematics is about to enter a period where it's more possible to do useful STEM research than in the past...</p><br><p>I think that's right.</p><br><p>But in the same way that a world with a 50% acceleration in math research will have a 200% acceleration relative to a world in 1800, maybe people are also thinking that the _rate _of progress in STEM is 50% less than _the rate _that it was in the 20th century.</p><br><p>This seems unlikely after reading the history of computer science. Computers have been getting much faster since the early 1980s, and a lot of the time comes during the decade of the invention.  (The history of "big data" as a field is even more dramatic.)</p><br><p>"Computer science as a whole hasn't really made much progress since the 80s/\xe2\x80\x8b90s"</p><br><p>As it is with a lot of empirical claims about mathematics, I don't really need to engage with the idea here.</p><br><p>There's this famous graph by the historian of software and machine intelligence Kevin Kelly:</p><br><p>The idea is that things look similar on the left and on the right, because the first half of the graph is focused on a 10-year window \xe2\x80\x93 but that after 1980, there was a kind of singularity or "AI winter" (or whatever you may call it).</p><br><p>There are several arguments, each of which the other don't engage with very well: </p><br><ul>
<li><em>Most progress</em> in the middle was driven by "AI", but as we move to the right, it becomes the case that "AI" can just be subsumed by "robots" or some other kind of technological process. For example, a "human-in-the-loop" algorithm for image recognition may be more-or-less as good as the best image recognition algorithms in some sense \xe2\x80\x93 or maybe even much much better.  (We know that some types of image recognition are easier than other types, but it is not clear that image recognition as a whole has become easier.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>A very small number of important advances</em> have driven the rate of progress pretty dramatically and in a way that would have to break all kinds of prior patterns. But I don't think that's <em>necessary</em> in order to argue that mathematical progress has slowed down.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>The shape of the graph looks a lot different for fields where human and AI interact, compared to fields where just AI advances at a steady pace.</em> In such cases (where there is some kind of interaction between the problem of "how to do AI well" and "how to do mathematics well") it makes sense to be able to say that the <em>rate of progress</em> in such fields has slowed down. But in other cases, I think the trend towards more/\xe2\x80\x8bslower acceleration is more likely just because some fields are becoming more/\xe2\x80\x8bless "AI-heavy" (i.e. there seem to be more/\xe2\x80\x8bless fields where research in AI seems to be driving research into algorithms for which a human can do the work \xe2\x80\x93 or conversely, research in algorithms that are used by humans <em>for</em> doing AI research \xe2\x80\x93 rather than the reverse).</li>
</ul><br><p>Finally, some people claim:</p><br><p>"If only there had been a "real AI boom" in the 80\xe2\x80\xb2s /\xe2\x80\x8b 90\xe2\x80\xb2s, then more people would have become interested in computer science!"</p><br><p>(The claim also includes the claim that there was some kind of "AI Winter" and that in the period after, academic communities that were focused on AI <em>"realised the value and necessity" of AI:</em>)</p><br><p>Okay, here's my counter to this. This is the one claim which I think is <em>most _interesting here, I think, because it's the most _counterintuitive</em>.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
