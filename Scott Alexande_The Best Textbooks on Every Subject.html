This is the one that explains to first-dan black belt why exactly the two jiu-jitsu techniques work, explains the relationship between nutrition and muscle loss, goes into greater detail on the causes of violence, and explains how to use a computer's command line. </p><br><p>It's everything a good textbook should be\xe2\x80\x94and everything an encyclopedia, or even a textbook on a narrow subject, should not be.</p><br><p>It is also an extraordinary project. I will leave many questions unanswered. I will tell you what <em>The Book of Now _does not cover, and what _The Book</em> doesn't cover. Some of the books I recommend below have not been published for more than ten years, but even with that fact in mind, the quality remains. I will say what I consider an important fact regarding some of the books below without telling you if that's actually a fact or a speculation, although I will occasionally give away a fact.</p><br><p>I have tried my hardest to link to some of the more notable textbooks below, but there are also some smaller books below which I haven't been able to link to, let me know and I'll try to add them if I can figure out what the appropriate URLs are.</p><br><p>The vast majority of the books below are on <em>the hard science of human health.</em> A few cover the basics of business, and business books are better than textbooks of anything else. All of these are organized by subject and by general type, which means some books are very technical and contain equations or graphs, while others summarize, clarify, or explain, which is why I've included textbooks on psychology, economics, and sociology in those sections as well.</p><br><p>The list below is not intended to be an endorsement of everything below, I just want to link to it so that you see what all I've tried to do. </p><br><p><strong>General Textbooks</strong></p><br><p>Some textbooks I've just linked to or have linked to, but I didn't include in the general books section below, but are worth reading.</p><br><ul>

</ul><br><p><em>Psychology</em></p><br><p>If something does not seem to fit in with any of the above books, please do comment. But I think they are a <em>really good</em> place to start (unless you have a subject you particularly care about, in which case maybe you should skip the links and read the specific books).</p><br><ul>

</ul><br><p>Buddpsych-Socrates is mostly focused on Buddhism, but may be a good start for the general rationalist community interested in buddhist thought. I think he is more interesting, but much less definitive in his arguments and is therefore unlikely to give many of his views as hard take-aways.</p><br><p>For the rest of the list, please comment below. If you don't live in the US we may still be able to help you, but it will require going through various links to find the corresponding books. Also let me know if there's any other useful resources I left out!</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
