The previous day's essay, <strong>How to Write a Short Post,</strong> is below.___</p><br><p>If you want to understand how to write for Less Wrong, you are welcome to continue by reading a long, long essay that started a year ago and will never end, titled "How to Write a Post that Matters."</p><br><p>Ah, but you have been warned.</p><br><p>In this essay, I would like to help you get your point across succinctly, in the style of posts on Less Wrong. This is a tricky challenge because, like with many tricky challenges, the solution isn't <em>just</em> to do the easier thing that you know.</p><br><p>As such, I will make you read two very long essays.</p><br><p>On the way to writing a post that matters, you had better read a long, long Less Wrong post that matters, right after reading one that doesn't. Let's call these two long, long items Bostrom's "Boltzmann's Brain," and <em>Map and Territory</em> (which started off as a comment in a thread on naturalism\xe2\x80\x94I wrote it to argue for a particular viewpoint, but because it's correct, I decided it was worth its own post).</p><br><p>(This essay may be a bit hard to skim, so I am recommending that if you see the long titles you click "Back" to see that paragraph I deleted.)</p><br><p>Also, although these two posts may seem to cover the same topics, the differences are important to understand while writing.</p><br><p>There are more technical and precise ways to say things that can make Less Wrong seem more like real science than the way I have to say things (for example, when trying to argue something like "the AI box experiment is a variant of Newcomb's problem where the box does something different, due to using real science instead of math or logic, so the moral should differ"). But at the same time, to see a lot of <em>not</em> being true requires technical knowledge to explain.</p><br><p>Let this serve as a warning that some posts and posts will seem easier than others, even when you are warned they are long. For some posts, if you are sufficiently confused, you should have a hard time absorbing them, due to the technical jargon. If you can read the post, but have difficulty absorbing the implications in the style of scientific thought, you should probably skim or read the preamble and conclusions to the post.</p><br><p>Now let us have a look at Bostrom's Boltzmann's brain, for it will be crucial:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>We begin by considering that our universe is immense: vast in space and time, immensely old. It is not infinite, though if it were spatially infinite then our universe could last an infinite number of ages. It is not eternal, though there exists a measure on our part of space-time for which an infinite amount of time exists (for a single observer, from within the measure). Given these points, the question at hand becomes whether there exists an observer that starts out in a Boltzmann brain state\xe2\x80\x94a random superposition of observer moments, as opposed to a single moment of a single observer. Given that all of us (and our descendants) are likely to be such Boltzmann brains, the question is then whether our descendants have any reason to believe in their continued existence.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>One line of consideration for them is the anthropic principle: our existence as observers gives us reason to believe that we exist, therefore our existence gives us reason to expect that others will exist. Thus our existence is evidence in favour of the truth of the 'our descendants exist' hypothesis. A particularly simple and clear argument for these claims is found in Nick Bostrom's paper on 'Boltzmann brains.'...To summarise this section briefly, Boltzmann brains might exist because they are more likely to exist than typical brains among our infinite universe. The argument proceeds as follows: consider the process of random fluctuations at the Big Bang, and the process by which these fluctuations can undergo self-reinforcing cycles of amplification. At some point in this amplification, there emerges a large collection of fluctuations that are very similar to any other particular fluctuation (e.g. within a few decimal places). Since our universe is roughly spatially infinite, and since we have reason to take ourselves as typical examples of universes, we can expect that a collection within the universe of a very large number of fluctuations that are similar to us is very likely, and expect to be amongst such a collection. Hence we have reason to expect that most universes will contain conscious observers. These conscious observers will have a large number of descendants with a very similar number of particles and very similar brain states, because our brain states (and the laws of physics) are only a few digits different from other conscious observers. Hence we have good reason to expect that our descendents exist\xe2\x80\x94we can thus apply the anthropic principle to ourselves (in combination with the other evidence above) in favour of the existence of future Boltzmann brains.</p><br><p>Let us consider the question as phrased in the abstract: "Do our descendants exist or not?"</p><br><p>The argument hinges on the truth of the following:</p><br><ul>
<li><em>The Anthropic Principle</em>: Our existence gives us reason in the abstract to believe that our descendants exist, even if we don't know which ones they are.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>The Measure of the Universe</em>: We exist in a universe that has a high enough measure of life-permitting configurations (like ours).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>Our typicality</em>: The fact that we exist as <em>humans</em>, rather than some other class of creatures, gives us reason to be more likely to be among our descendants than creatures that evolved differently.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>Our similarity to other human brains</em>: A universe with a lot of humans (or their descendants) running around would be more likely to have other humans. Also, we expect that the universe is mostly still the same in the vast majority of ways: one of the reasons why I think human brains evolved, is because we have so much in common with each other\xe2\x80\x94this is one reason why the human brain might be a useful model for the study of intelligence and so on.</li>
</ul><br><p>It does seem reasonable that if there are more than one human family, that one on Earth might look more like other Homo Sapiens, hence more likely to end up with our descendants.</p><br><p>Furthermore, we know that the universe can't get into too many states with only humans, or else we wouldn't be here to observe our universe, but that there are other kinds of creatures as well\xe2\x80\x94so, it stands to reason that if there are <em>many</em> Earths, then at least <em>some</em> of our descendants will be life-permitting.</p><br><p><strong>P.1, P.2, P.3</strong> seem fairly obvious. So all that is left is <strong>P.4</strong>, where the crux is whether we can be expected to see only humans or all living things, or whether we can expect other living things <em>among our descendants</em>.</p><br><p>My argument for the former is contained in Nick Bostrum's paper. I am not going to go into the details in this essay, since this essay is already so long, but I will quote some relevant phrases so you don't forget:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The argument that we would be among the first humans to exist is weaker than it seems. There are various ways we might be among the first. If we use it to support the above argument, we need the existence condition to hold not merely with some chance\xe2\x80\x94namely, an infinitesimal chance\xe2\x80\x94but for most observers (that is, all observers that can observe), with overwhelming probability. Given that these observers would almost certainly be Boltzmann brains with different histories and memories, we can take it as at least moderately likely that there are some of our descendants that we are.[1]</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>To take an example that many will have the chance of being a Boltzmann baby, imagine that a computer scientists creates (non-consciously) a computer simulation of a Boltzmann-brain universe, and that every 100 seconds it erases the simulation, creating a different universe to use in its place (the laws of physics would still apply of course to the remaining universe). There is no way that you could be anything but a Boltzmann in one of the subsequent 100 universes. A Boltzmann is a brain that appears randomly in an infinite universe, and it would be randomly copied thereafter, with no reason to favour one copy over another. The computer scientist reasons that, in this infinite series of universes, at least one copy of someone like us will exist. (The laws of physics would prevent this copy from "surviving" after the erasure: after a hundred seconds, it would simply have ceased to be a Boltzmann.) If this simulation continued long enough, this copy and subsequent ones would eventually become the <em>majority</em> of Boltzmann brains (i.e. there would be overwhelming odds that at least one of humanity's descendants can exist).</p>
</blockquote><br><p>So here we see that:</p><br><ul>
<li>If there are many simulated Boltzmann universes, at least _some _of our successors will be simulated.</li>
