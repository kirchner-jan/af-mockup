Judge (2007):</p><br><blockquote>
<pre><code> Some of the authors who have suggested that brain size is an upper limit to brain complexity, and that the human brain is relatively small in this regard, might have been taken in by a sort of anthropomorphism; the human brain might merely be a big brain _for reasons_. By analogy, a human brain might seem less bright because it is big relative to insects, and the fact that it is also big might be due to having its own innate mechanism by which it is dulled.
</code></pre>
</blockquote><br><p>But why shouldn't larger brains be an advantage in an environment with very few problems to solve, but lots of problems to avoid? The more you have on your brain to work with, the more you can choose between different routes to get the same result.</p><br><p><strong>Tl;dr;</strong></p><br><p>If you wanted to go to the moon would you carry a huge bag of tools on your back? Or would you go to the moon with the essentials or something that a 3 person team was able to create in weeks?</p><br><p><strong>No one can predict the future and we can't tell how much of the future will be created by evolution (of humans, animals or humans). The tools we have today aren't a guarantee of what we want to do 50 years from now. </strong></p><br><p><strong>The difference between evolution and a 3 person team is that evolution is an ongoing process as it works in new environments, so the information it has for us to use to change is much more accessible to us. If what we needed to do was change our DNA and our organs we wouldn't know to do that\xe2\x80\x94how would we notice if the tools we use today aren't the ones we want?</strong></p><br><p>While evolution can work to make sure it retains useful information, that doesn't mean that it is doing a good job today of retaining our brains as they work today. It's still a question as to how much we want to know about our own bodies and minds as they are today. __</p><br><p>I want to think about my knowledge of intelligence, knowing that intelligence isn't really about being good at a job in the way that we think it is, when we hear the word "intelligence".  <em>What does intelligence feel like</em> and is this something that can be improved on through learning?</p><br><p>I can't give a definite answer about how to improve on intelligence, but I might be able to give you a broad idea.  (I say broad because I don't want to over-confidently say "I know".)  I think intelligence might be about  "finding good pathways. Making good choices."  It's not like one of these things was invented just now, humanity has been doing these things for a long time.</p><br><p><strong>"Being smart is knowing where to find things out in the world."</strong></p><br><p><strong>You can see this principle of intelligence as one of discovery or as a sort of knowledge of how to make things work.</strong> The more knowledge you have the easier it is to find solutions.</p><br><p>This is important because if we had a knowledge of what to do about a particular problem, then we would probably be able to find the thing a relatively short time after finding out about it, or even do it ourselves. __</p><br><p>On the other hand, if I never bothered to learn what IQ tests were, then when I finally got around to look them up, it might be only after I spent a while trying that I would find out what they measured. __</p><br><p>Or maybe I wouldn't do the research, I would ask someone and they would say, "there's a reason they called it <em>IQ</em>" and then I wouldn't know anything different than what they said, I wouldn't even be able to recognise if there's any evidence that the only reason this is so called is that most people think that it describes intelligence. Or maybe I'd do the research and see that it doesn't really. __</p><br><p>It would be too confusing to just have one set answers to questions. If I were a beginner at chess, I was confused about what to do when facing another strong player. Maybe a beginner in chess would know that the opening of a new game is very often very good, therefore I should explore the opening, maybe move the pieces to the right places to start with, maybe use my pawns to attack and so on. That would be better than just knowing opening or middle game. So how would I know if I was doing it right? Well, if I got it wrong would I just figure that out after the fact? Or might I even do research to make sure that what I was doing was right or not? Maybe I had no idea how chess works but if I did find out after while, it would be hard to figure out the right thing from there because the basic information is always evolving.  (And the information we have today could very well be obsolete tomorrow).</p><br><p><strong>I would also say:</strong> intelligence isn't just a measurement.  "IQ tests measure you ability to get a lot of information into your head in a short space of time."</p><br><p>This seems easier, and I might be able even to improve my "IQ test scores" by improving my reading abilities or by learning to use new tools that help me to find information (more on finding information, later).</p><br><p><strong>If you read a book from start to finish every day you might increase your IQ a lot because it gives you more information to put into different pathways.</strong> If you get more information per unit time then you can get more done faster. It might increase your effectiveness.</p><br><p><strong>It seems that intelligence is made more efficient by being able to quickly store a load of information (information about what you are looking for and how to look for it) in your brain (your cortex) over time.</strong></p><br><p>I can do things like this:</p><br><ul>
<li>Start a list; this list contains what I call the "information that I want to have" in my head. This list contains things like;</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The name of my friends</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The name and address of places in the city that I live in</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What job I'm thinking about becoming (I'm a physics teacher at one point and I'm just trying to decide what job to do next) </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My favourite video games</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A list of people that I know well (or at least that I'd like to learn more about)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People that look like me</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My hobbies</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My favourite music</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My interests</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My hobbies and favourite music</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Ask what music I am listening to (use a memory palace from how it all started to remember the different songs).  This requires me to "unpack" these pieces of data that I want to put in different pathways. (I haven't started trying to do this yet because it's just a little list so far)</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Some of my information that I want to remember can include:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>How many of my friends go to a music group. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How many of them are friends with the guy who owns this band</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are all of his bands apart from this one?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What's the address of the place he lives?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is his favourite sport?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Do he and the band leader have the same number of fingers? </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Do he like the same foods as me, what's his favourite drink other than coffee?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are my favourite clothes? What's his favourite clothes?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Is he a good boy? Is he a good friend?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Is everything on his list (my list may be too small yet)?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What's his favourite video game? Is it the same as my favourite video game?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Do they like the same music as me?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Is it a lot easier to walk around in his city compared to walking around in mine?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'm getting a sense of what his personality is like, is it like mine?</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>I might add to the list, things like:</strong></p><br><p><strong>What are his hobbies and favourite past time?</strong></p><br><p><strong>Other ways of remembering information:</strong></p><br><p>The more I know the more I can put the information in my memory</p><br><p>The things that can be put in a memory are really interesting. What they say about information storage:</p><br><blockquote></blockquote><br><ul>
<li>A memory is a thing that you can retrieve. If you don't know where it is, that's the problem\xe2\x80\x94you need to look somewhere or use a mental map to find something, or find a landmark.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some memories are strong, others weak. The stronger the memory, the more easily it will come to mind. The weak ones tend to get lost in noise.</li>
</ul><br><p>If you find out that two people are alike in that they have the same name, you can put their names in the first place of the list. They can be placed next to each other to help the brain figure out where the same-nameed people might be placed.</p><br><p>From the book <em>Brainworks</em>, by John Kounios and Mark Beeman:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
