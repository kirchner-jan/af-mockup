<p>I propose that when we think we are thinking, we usually really are thinking\xe2\x80\x94we just know it too well to realize it. (I use "thinking" as in the sense of System 1, not System 2. System 2 reasoning also involves various kinds of meta-cognition, as well as deliberation, decision-making, and other kinds of reflection.)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The example he presents us with to explain his view is that of a man who sits in his living room, looking out his big picture window\xe2\x80\x94for example, an old couple sitting on their front porch, and the man looking out the window at the street:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Imagine that a couple of cars pass by your big picture window, one after the other, without stopping. Each car lights its own turn signal, but the couple on the porch only look once, and then, after it has passed, never look again. They never wave at the drivers. The cars pass, without a pause, without a gap, without a break of any kind. All the drivers are doing their jobs, as required of them by the traffic code; they are obeying the rules. If, after a while, some drivers stop and offer a hand to the couple on the couch, the latter will shake their hand and be polite without argument or complaint. They will nod, and try to look like they are doing the appropriate thing. What is going on here?</p>
</blockquote><br><p>He argues that this is more or less what is going on in our minds when we think we're thinking:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>...we are seeing and hearing our own internal experiences, which we may or may not be paying attention to. But we are aware that we are <em>seeing and hearing</em> those experiences, and so on this basis we can in theory describe our mental state, which then can provide us with a way to predict how we will behave in various situations. That is, we are predicting ourselves based on what we think we know about our internal states rather than based on our own observations or on the actual facts about the situation at hand.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>And so we are, in effect, deceiving ourselves.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>There is almost certainly a grain of truth to the story. We do not fully understand the world, and therefore we do not fully understand ourselves. Therefore (I reason) we cannot be fully certain about the extent to which we are thinking or not thinking in any given situation. However, at any given time, even if the world is such "for all practical purposes" that I am uncertain about my own mind, I will still be "trying" to think of what I observe out there in the world. Since the world seems to work that way, I will at least expect the internal predictions I make based on my mind to be reasonably accurate...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The way the brain represents the world, in fact has a lot to do with the sorts of mistakes that System 2 makes when it reasons. If you haven't already read the whole article, let me briefly summarize some of the relevant points:</p><br><ul>
<li>Thinking is divided between two parts of the brain: System 1 and System 2.  (In terms of the original dichotomy in Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow.")  System 1 has two major parts: Attention and Motor Control.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Attention is the part of perception that allows us to perceive and categorize a situation:</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>Attention is what allows us to perceive things in the world around us as a pattern rather than a collection of disconnected and unique sensations. Attention allows us to extract <em>useful</em> features from our environment. In other words, you don't have to have a detailed description of every sensation in order to label a scene.</p><br><ul>
<li>\t</li>
</ul><br><p>When you are thinking about what is going on, the parts of your attention that you are focusing on are your <em>beliefs</em>, your <em>perceptions</em> of the situation, and the parts <em>of your perception</em> that can be related to the parts of the world that are in your <em>perception of the world.</em>  (What the world <em>really</em> looks like, according to your senses.)</p><br><p>Attention can be divided between the parts of the sensory modality with the most available detailed information, where available detailed information means information that your senses give you.</p><br><p>Motor Control represents the System 1 part of perception that is responsible for moving the eyes, arms, and legs that allow you to see what the world is actually like.</p><br><ul>
<li>Motor Control is what moves your "muscles of thought."  It is represented by our subconscious movements of posture and hand gestures, which are the basis of all types of writing.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This process of making sense of what is happening around you can happen as quickly as an instant, or as slowly as a normal perception. (For your own physical safety, you can't be too slow moving, so this means that you have to prioritize things.) I've recently been referring to this as "System 1 processing."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>System 1 doesn't have an individual working memory where it stores all of its thoughts and ideas. Instead, the information that it takes in each instant gets stored as long-lasting patterns in the brain.  (This is an important part of why it's called a System 1 and not a System 2.)  So, what happens to System 2 processing? It depends on what was the focus of your attention. You might try to think about red cars, for example, and end up with thoughts like: "Red...red...red...red...".  Not a great strategy when you are trying to remember something you don't understand!  (A recent study I saw suggested that students were more likely to fail at their calculus problems if they tried to consider whether an expression in the problem was the sum of the integrations of two functions.)  So then the System 1-type brain parts that had focus on red cars would get access to some of our System 2-type brain parts without System 2 parts being able to "read" the System 1 thoughts too easily. Your mind will start thinking about red cars even if you consciously decide that you don't really care about red cars.  (Or, more rarely, if you consciously choose to _not _think about red cars, when you notice a red car, you will think about red cars.)  This causes people to feel guilty about thoughts that they know to be just about something they want to think about a lot, like their partner.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What happens when you stop trying to do a particular cognitive task that you don't understand, or can't understand because other parts of your mind don't want to? You find yourself "not <em>quite</em> thinking"\xe2\x80\x94you are still thinking and still talking (to others, in your head), but you can't manage to actually remember what it is that you were thinking about.  (Or maybe it is that you are stopped paying attention to something that was interesting to you in the first place.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>That's it. That's the intentional stance:  Your mind is not the same thing as the things that it was doing or thinks about.  (A "system 1" is an "intentional stance" in the sense that the behavior of a system 1 part is, itself, the result of a hypothesis about what it is that it's up to. In other words: whatever is going on in my mind, it is the mind itself that is up to it.)</li>
</ul><br><p>In this discussion, I imagine "System 2" to be the mind as a whole, while the parts of its attention that focus on some parts of the world are what I am calling System 1. This might be hard to describe, because System 2 has too many parts. Here is Daniel Kahneman's description (from 2002) of the cognitive difference between those parts of him that are aware of System 1 and those System 1 parts that are aware of themselves:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I call it the intentional stance: It is a way of regarding the behavior of a thought or emotion in terms of what you, the actor, desires to happen; that is, what you want to happen. Your mind does this automatically, and is thus not on the level of consciousness as described by Descartes. I think most people can agree that when someone is angry, they tend to behave in ways they would not behave if they were not angry...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>For my part, I used the term System 1 to refer to the System 1 part that is watching the traffic, and using it as a way of predicting what sort of traffic is approaching, or an algorithm that chooses when to turn, or whatever. System 1 is also the "System 1 part" in my description of the process of taking in sensory information and categorizing it, which I think is what we usually mean by 'thinking'.  System 1 is also probably the part that does "what are these people doing?" processing and makes the "Is that a duck?" association, or whatever.</p><br><p>A part of System 2 I imagine to be the parts of the mind that are paying attention, to some extent, to the part of the experience that they are experiencing. That is, to some extent what they are really consciously aware of is their beliefs: how they got those beliefs, and the evidence that led to them. In this respect, System 1 is "taking the outside view" on the part of system 2, and not taking System 1 "inside view".  System 2 takes the System 1 information into account in making its better predictions.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
