</ul><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p><em>This is a follow-up to a post titled Is Realistic Existential Risk Evaluation Neglected?. This post expands upon a couple of themes that have appeared in that post. I think this expanded discussion serves to confirm the relevance of the research we are trying to encourage to existential risk, and can also be interesting to readers outside our audience who may prefer another subject. I've added clarifications throughout to make it more clear what the original post meant by "existential risk".</em></p><br><p>Motivation and desire</p><br><p>In the post above, I stated that my concern, and that of other people who might be interested in AI alignment research (and alignment research in general), was a concern that there might be a lack in motivation to work on alignment, or an underdeveloped desire to do so. I discussed two types of alignment research\xe2\x80\x94systems alignment, which I will discuss as "AI alignment", and research focusing on motivations and desires of humans (which I'll call "HRI alignment").</p><br><p>A related motivation-desire analysis would have a look at the motivation and desires of AI researchers, and try to model them in terms of alignment or safety considerations. While I don't know enough about the desires and motivations of AI researchers, I can suggest the following tentative models.</p><br><p><em>These models are far from complete.</em></p><br><p>Intelligence</p><br><p>I conjecture that alignment researchers have a motivation to work on AI alignment for general scientific curiosity and for the potential impacts.</p><br><p>For instance, I'd guess that the current AI safety and alignment research communities came into being for <em>pure</em> curiosity of the research problem they work on, and not from any desire to increase safety or decrease risk of existential risk. (It's also possible that alignment-style research was an instrumental goal for those who originally proposed it, or a side-effect of other instrumental goals.)</p><br><p>AI researchers versus other professionals</p><br><ul>
<li>As a practical matter, it may be more cost-effective for someone to work on "AI alignment" (rather than on other alignment research) if they have a good working knowledge of the field and a working belief that they understand the relevant literature.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Moreover, I think that this motivation may have led to the emergence of alignment researchers as a specific cluster of researchers. (This may explain some of the specific motivations of current alignment researchers.)</li>
</ul><br><p>Conclusion and discussion</p><br><p>This post is just a quick write-up and some tentative conjectures, and it does not seem to offer conclusive answers. But I do think it's important that we think about the motivations of AI experts and try to model their desires in the light of AI safety or AI alignment considerations. So please keep an open mind when reading, and perhaps think of how you may have been misled or dis-confirmed in your beliefs as a result of this post.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
