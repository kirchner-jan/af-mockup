I'll start by explaining why I think niceness matters.</p><br><p>It took me a long time to figure this one out. Not that I'm complaining, it was a great benefit of being an extrovert in my formative years that I could be around intelligent people all the time. However, I came to realise that if you want to have a good relationship with others, you won't do well if you aren't nice to them. This means you have to spend at least a reasonable amount of time _on _topics you'd rather not discuss, the most inane topics you can imagine... and I was a geek at heart so I was a real fan of science fiction and fantasy... so obviously that was where I spent my free time.</p><br><p>I didn't actually understand how to change the nature of the discussions I was having, but in retrospect they were no more than attempts to avoid topics like death, religion, politics, and how to raise children. There's a lot of ground to cover there, but I felt I had at least to get the discussions related to these down before I'd get to be a nice person elsewhere.</p><br><p>But when I did start on the path of niceness, I couldn't just read an article on it and start being nicer. I had to come to terms with the fact that niceness is actually hard. That I might fail at it, and that there might be a whole cluster of social skills that go into niceness that I hadn't discovered yet. I found the self-help world had a lot of useful tips, but no one could tell me if I'd succeeded or failed. I had to figure out how to cultivate niceness on my own over time, working on the basis that I could fail and learn from it if it didn't work out.</p><br><p>I went looking for a book that explained this (since I thought I might want my daughter to be a nice girl and have a good life) and came across "Handbook of Social Psychology". I had read the first chapter and decided to put it aside, figuring I'd read the rest later. It was in the process of un-putting the book away and starting the next chapter (and doing so because this book contained one of the most useful, applicable tips there) that I realised "if the information in this handbook is this useful why haven't I absorbed it by now?" When I got through most of chapter one, I didn't see what anyone had ever done by reading a single part of this handbook that would've been useful to them. Maybe I didn't believe the research or something, but from what I'm reading now, the book is fairly self- explanatory and useful to apply. It taught me all kinds of things about the world, what scientists call "cognitive decoupling". If you haven't read this, go find the Wikipedia article to figure it out if you don't believe me.</p><br><p>I decided to give it another shot and finished the remaining chapters. It was pretty obvious by this point that I had been ignoring the whole handbook (since I didn't believe a book could be helpful after just one chapter). Then I came across a book that used information contained in chapters, and I figured, if it worked for a book it would work for a handbook too. I was still convinced reading the handbook couldn't possibly do anything as I didn't have much use for information it contained, but I decided to give this strategy another chance, not because I was certain it wouldn't work, but because I wasn't confident it wouldn't work. The book went way further. And I finished.</p><br><p>I spent the next few months teaching people things I'd learnt in the handbook, but with a focus on the stuff that people don't talk to each other about because of societal scripts and taboos around things like religion. I used to have to try pretty hard to break things loose, which I'm not proud of. I'd have an agenda about this that I would explain, but when I'd get people to take it seriously, it fell on me to explain the concept of "cognitive decoherence". That's how nice I'd been in high school, not at all this deep stuff, just the things you would talk about with an intelligent, curious, fun-loving girl in college. Except, once I'd started doing it I had the advantage over my high school counterpart, who had to work pretty hard to pull it off. A fact that made me kind of envious.</p><br><p>All the nice stuff I did that summer and the fall was just stuff I had done in college and in the process of teaching my little social skills to people I just happened to end up being kind of nice. But it was just the beginning, I felt on some level that nice skills didn't have to be forced, I ought to figure out how they were really supposed to be acquired.</p><br><p>I never really looked into niceness research, but while working my way through my own book I stumbled across articles on "niceness", or "agreeableness" as it's known in other studies. Some of these articles were about the general concept of the subject, not how to be nice. So, to my dismay I began reading, and found it was actually harder to be nice _as a general social phenomenon _than I had feared.</p><br><p>I hadn't expected this to be the case, because most articles on niceness were about teaching people to be nicer, not about it being a natural byproduct of being nice... but it turned out to be. As I was learning these ways of niceness, it became clear how the different things I'd been doing throughout the summer and fall would make me better off, but the skills would be mutually beneficial and the extra niceness could be useful for people who had <em>not</em> been trained to be nice or for whom niceness wasn't important. This was a pleasant surprise\xe2\x80\x94I was able to use my nice skills not just to get people to be nicer in the moment, but also in learning their social skills.</p><br><p>I've been teaching people how to be nice all my adult life now, and it keeps working. I try to be nice to people, both in life and online, pretty much as much as I can. It works out, just like teaching people how to talk intelligently and think about things analytically and be well-rounded. I have very few people I actually care about, I get the impression they'd be better off not talking to me... but these people are the people who give me opportunities to practice niceness in ways that most people cannot imagine. The fact that the concept of niceness is hard to grasp and that most people are not interested in being nice has been my saving grace.</p><br><p>The book has helped me see how I use my niceness as a bargaining chip (or how I've been interpreting it, because I don't use niceness as an <em>exact</em> bargaining chip) that I'm willing to compromise over. Some small things I'm willing to give up just to get other people to be nicer. But there's plenty of other stuff I wouldn't give up, such as time investment by someone who wants my help with something. On the other hand, I am the first person I know to be in a position of having to actually, really be nice to people all the time instead of just being nice to everyone in a roundabout fashion. I tend to have a lot of leverage over others, which is a double edge sword. It enables me to push in other ways, like being persistent and not giving up, but can lead to manipulation and coercion. It could be a problem, for example, if a person I <em>am</em> nice to starts manipulating me to be mean to someone on the internet. If someone is that nasty and I didn't realise until later that I should've been more discerning.</p><br><p>This book is helping me build my skills as a person that other people actually want to be around... which, when I'm honest with myself, is kind of scary. It's scary because it means I've been a terrible person for most of my life, and worse, that I'm an even worse person at being nice now than I was then. It's <em>actually</em> scary enough that I'm considering leaving academia now because I fear that after I graduate I'll have to live in the world for the rest of my life or the world will get worse. Being nice to people and making a difference in the world is just a <em>really scary</em> thing to contemplate, but it's a much better thing to be able to do because then you've already got an audience to be nice to and it's the nice people you have to look after. Niceness is the skill I'm trying to build before I start a family (which I do for the rest of this week).</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
