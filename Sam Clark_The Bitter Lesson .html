I have deliberately left out the jargon, to make it more accessible. I hope this makes it more accessible as well.</em></p><br><p><em>I will be discussing three problems: the problem of self-deception, the problem of motivated cognition, and the problems raised by postmodernism, critical theory and deconstruction. I have done my best to avoid the word "self-deception". This post is part of a series on biases, and one of the biases discussed in this post is the bias towards self-deception. This post has two sub-titles, if that makes it clearer</em>.</p><br><p>The bitter lesson is the idea that the best way to come to truth-based decisions, is actually to have those truth-based decisions to begin with. _Not only this, but _that these truth-based decisions are often based in a lot of implicit background assumptions about the world and how it works, and are thus likely to be wrong. There were, in principle, two paths to finding truth: have a true world-model, and use that to make true decisions based on what is true. In practice, most people follow a third path:  use a false world-model, that is based more on tribal affiliations, personal preferences and aesthetics than actual truth, and follow that false model to make decisions, based then on their preferences. </p><br><p>Tribal affiliations don't cause people to be wrong, they cause people to be right. It's much easier to convince yourself that your tribe is right than that their tribe is right (and often easier than that reality is right either), so it's often easier to convince yourself of something that has nothing to do with reality at all, than it is to come up with a model that has some reasonable amount of truth to it. It's the problem of motivated reasoning, and people will always have trouble coming up with true conclusions even when they have everything they need to come up with them: they have a false map on which a correct interpretation of the territory doesn't show up. Thus, in practice, anyone who is in the habit of forming an accurate map of the territory ends up at some point coming to some conclusions that are simply not true, and being a better map-maker or a better thinker is not going to help them avoid that error. This is the bitter lesson in a nutshell: the way to achieve truth in the long-term is to have truth in the first place. If there's any possible path there could be, it has to be one where true understanding leads to truth in the long run, or otherwise the path is doomed to failure. </p><br><p>Let's look at the three biases discussed in the post:</p><br><ul>
<li>The problem of self-dereliction, or the failure to integrate current evidence and knowledge with our background belief-structure:  when people think about the world, they often end up stuck in a mode that is only based on their current beliefs. They have a map-like system in their head that they trust, which generates thoughts like, "I don't trust that map, it's too unreliable to lead me to truth" or "I trust the social environment, it is in some way correct" or "There's not enough solid evidence to decide, I'll just go with my background".</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Motivated cognition: when people are trying to think about a topic, there are a lot of thoughts that they are trying to avoid having. They feel like there is something immoral, or wrong, or embarrassing about having these thoughts, or would feel too vulnerable, or there is something they don't want anyone else to think they don't understand. These thoughts may not have anything bad on their own, but it is enough of a self-imposed inhibition that they will fail in the short-term if they cannot find a way to overcome their fear or embarrassment and actually think about these topics.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Postmodernism and critical theory in general: many people, who I would expect to really be truth-oriented, have some sort of deep-down belief in the idea that everything is a political power struggle. Many of the people that fall into this category also end up identifying as Marxist, because Marx thought a lot about such issues. Postmodern critical theory can have a terrible tendency to turn everything into an identity war, to the extent that it doesn't even see the possibility that there might be anything worth understanding at all, let alone that you were able to come to understand it. </li>
</ul><br><p>Self-dereliction is especially dangerous: people can think they are thinking about something, but all the while it is something entirely different, they are just thinking about their past, about their current map, about what they think other people think they believe or think they should believe.</p><br><p>Postmodernism and critical thinking are related: critical thinking makes you more open to new information so you can better synthesize it with the information you already have, then you evaluate the output. Postmodernism says critical thinking is a power-play that can go horribly in the wrong direction, by making you reject the idea that there might be any truth other than postmodernism. Critical thinking doesn't mean rejecting any beliefs\xe2\x80\x94far from it.</p><br><p>As a result of this, critical thinking, and postmodernism as a whole, is a really big deal in all three types of failure mode listed above. They lead to people trying to fit the facts to their already-held model and refusing to think about the facts at all, and that causes them to make more and more unfounded assumptions.</p><br><p>I feel like that generalizes a bit. When we form our model, which we have in our heads, it is formed a lot by how we have seen things before. Even if many of the facts we have in our model have been validated and are part of what they are, that does not mean that their model is itself unbiased\xe2\x80\x94it is. This is all part of the bitter lesson of biases and mistakes in general; the way to make a useful map, is to take a good map, and then, with enough new information added to it to bring it up to date, make a new map. You can't just have the map that is in your head, and then decide that the map is right; you have to change some of that map to more reflect the territory. </p><br><p>I want to expand on a particular aspect of this phenomenon: the fact that critical thinking seems to make people too open to new information, and that the postmodernists would not accept that any truth was possible. They believe that every truth you have, is something which is just postmodernism.</p><br><p>The way they reason like this is very odd and not usually how humans work.</p><br><p>It's not that you have to reject postmodernism to believe in science, because postmodernism is based around the idea that all knowledge comes from science; it does not in fact say that all knowledge comes exclusively from science. </p><br><p>When most people think of postmodernism, they think in terms of the ideas and arguments which were popularized through books like <em>The Postmodernist Manifesto and Other Philosophical Controversies</em> or <em>Seeing the Smoke</em>, and many, especially those who are familiar with the arguments, get a sense of why the ideas might not be a good idea. This can take many forms on postmodernist philosophy, I don't want to get into the details, suffice to say a large subset of postmodernists would take on the ideas of the scientific method and the theories of the universe that it has led to so far.</p><br><p>Now for postmodernism, it is not something people just accept and then live with; they are quite the contrarians! People like Peter Godfrey Smith or David Deutsch are among the most recognizable examples of these contrarians, and their ideas are often very exciting, and I would say their ideas have a lot of the same appeal to some as science fiction (though this is by design, science fiction being a genre which tends to reject realism, and I would also claim to have a lot of science fiction readers who like my work). </p><br><p>If a group of contrarians came up with an idea, you might at first think it was a wild idea. But these contrarians are very smart people: when they got interested enough in this idea, they would have thought about it in various ways. They would ask, "Do people believe this idea?", "Am I the only one who sees this idea?" and "If I try to convince people of this idea, am I right?" (and a host of other questions to make sure they can't come up with some reason to think they are wrong before rejecting the idea).</p><br><p>If they were sufficiently intrigued with the idea, if it had the right mix of plausible-at-the-time but clearly weirdness factors, and they came up with an argument why the idea might or might not be true, then they could have generated other new things that need to be considered. And most likely they would have come up with some arguments as to why they were not sure the argument was true\xe2\x80\x94there is likely plenty of evidence for why we are not sure of most things, and why we should generally be very suspicious of things that start out as wild arguments! In the end if they had a line of arguments that seemed compelling to them, and they thought critically about the idea, they would come to see that the idea might indeed be at least a reasonable hypothesis.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
