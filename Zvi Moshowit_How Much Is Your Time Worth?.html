It is important to note that is true, but it mostly has the following implications.</p><br><ol>
<li>If Covid-19 is an existential threat to jobs and civilization, we have a problem. It's not obvious how much of that problem is from it being an existential threat, and how much is from it being the first time in a decade the thing I think it will make people think is the thing I think is an existential threat.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>If you're thinking about quitting your job to do what you want, <em>your job was a lot worse this year with COVID-19 than the year before COVID-19</em>. That's a _big deal. _You should quit your job to do something different, if that applies to you.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>If there's a lot of unemployment and it's getting worse, it doesn't make sense to do the things you have to do to land a job, such as applying everywhere and networking, when a large fraction of jobs you might want won't be going to anyone. I agree with a lot of people that it would make sense to do a lot of self-employment and self-employment is often a better idea.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>If all the jobs are full of people with Covid-19, and you're not one of the people with Covid, it's probably not necessary to worry about a job at this point. In most places, no one is applying.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>The situation should be even worse, perhaps far worse, than the general picture, and that would mean employers are actively sabotaging many people, or are outright lying about the job situation, to their workers, and if they don't solve it soon they will see real disaster in their workplace, and I see no reason to care that they can't tell the difference.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>There's a lot of pressure on big companies to make themselves look better here, because that's the only way they get to avoid blame. People say everything has to 'look good on paper,' and when a lot of large companies do look good they find that they can no longer hide it anymore, and that's a _terrible _thing to happen, even for the small handful of companies that are actively good while the government and others don't think that way.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>What happens if there are large numbers of Covid-19 cases among a group of people in an office, or an employer decides to be super cautious? Many people I know are freaking out right now, or are planning to, because they can't take a big hit if they are the ones with the disease and everyone else gets to go to work safely. The first large hit is going to be to the employees, so it has to be handled carefully by the employer.</li>
</ol><br><p>I do have a lot of people in mind here that are going to get screwed, and people who did things they think were right (which I strongly disagree with, they did the right thing, and also they are being screwed).</p><br><ol>
<li>It's hard to tell the real story here, because the stories have to adjust to change in who is in the world on many levels and what jobs are involved, but you can see a lot of this story here, both to employers and employees.</li>
</ol><br><p>I think in many ways, what I believe to be true here in New York was true even more than that, although the local situation is substantially different here.</p><br><ol>
<li>The situation being what it is, employers have no need to worry about _determining whether someone in their employ has Covid, or has to quarantine, or get tested, or treat the disease, or have any other reasonable expectation of how to handle it. _It's a major disruption. People care. Those who don't care lose money. It's easy to explain why not caring is important.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Employers who can pay are forced to either pay less than they would have to pay for workers who have some degree of Covid-related health risks (which they'd never accept and which would end up hurting many people), or they pay a lot, or they do both.</li>
</ol><br><p>So what are the alternatives, other than the status quo and letting all the workers have Covid-19?</p><br><p>There's no alternative.</p><br><p>My guess and prediction is that it's over.</p><br><p>If my understanding of the various levels of how this will play out goes right, I'd say something like this.</p><br><p>The number of infections or contacts a company needs to be worried about (or the minimum one such number) has historically been determined by the kind of work people do, and what equipment is in the work or the environment. The first half of this year was about the same as last year, and then when it started the threshold rose quite a lot and is now much, much larger, along with some other changes. If the 'good enough' threshold continues to rise, and people adjust accordingly, this seems mostly over, and any new rules about it mostly don't make much sense.</p><br><p>I predict we mostly don't have to deal with that much, or at least it comes in waves where each wave gets its own media, our government tells us what to do instead. If it's not that simple, though, then we're headed for the same big mess as last time. In which case it might end up not being over quite so fast this time.</p><br><p>The last week was quite interesting, it looked like New York might be headed for a 'wave' of cases, which seemed unlikely to me, and it turned out to not be. Instead I got to see what a 'wave' looks like, and it mostly came in three groups.</p><br><p>The first wave that will now hit New York is the wave of people who got a positive Covid-19 and aren't thinking about it, but who didn't take any personal risk precautions.</p><br><p>The second wave is the wave of employees who are already Covid-free and who want to stay that way. A lot of them, I think, especially in bigger companies. Most of them are probably not going to get exposed. I expect this to mostly be a small number of days of worry by employers (or one big day when a lot of people who work in a bunch of places get infected, and then we will hear about it a lot, but they're not going to be as likely to spread Covid-19) and then that's it. Even if the number of <em>hits _is substantial, there won't be many _misses.</em> In this case, I think the most likely outcome is the most positive one, even if things are mostly still fine in one's own building or group of buildings.</p><br><p>The third wave is the longtermers who got sick from Covid but still have it on the medical record. Many of these people will have recovered, but it is likely that a substantial fraction will continue to have health consequences for a while. That makes it tricky. My guess is that this wave won't be huge, unless it does happen, and it will almost entirely wash out. I'll likely have more to say about it later.</p><br><p>Now onto practical stuff.</p><br><p>This post has been sitting in my drafts folder for a few days (but I didn't want to post it just yet because it was a bigger wave coming). I now can add it to my previous and hopefully less complete collection of Covid-prevention-related advice, to help.</p><br><p><strong>Go To Restaurants And Bar Beaches</strong></p><br><p>The first, second and third best things that we can do are all to make our lives as normal as possible while we work to make our lives better after that. We need to support each other in doing that.</p><br><p>The main thing to do to help that comes next is to do what we can to prevent new places from opening up, while we keep seeing if things get better or worse. Our restaurants are vital, our beaches and parks are vital, and we need to be sure they stay that way.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
