<p>Politics is the mind killler: If you want to keep your friends, stay away from politics; if you want to find truth and win an argument, go there. When I was at Stanford there was a famous professor of computer science, Yann Le Grand. He was a communist when he was a student at the University of Grenoble, in France. One day, he wanted to have lunch with some of his friends. In the French restaurant he ran into another French professor by the name of Jean-Luc Picard. Picard was a Christian. Le Grand was a communist, and the students at Stanford that were present were also left-leaning. So, after their lunch was out of the way, Picard began talking about what was good and what was bad in the United States, as he saw it. According to Picard, the United States was doing good things and the U.S.S.R. was, in his opinion, doing evil things.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Le Grand, being of the French left, had no particular problems with Picard's statement. He agreed with Picard.</p><br><p>Then, says Le Grand, Picard got up to go.</p><br><p>And said, "I have a piece of advice for you, Monsieur Le Grand, and it's this: When someone starts giving you advice, and the advice that they are giving you, and it's good advice, and they're telling the truth in some sense, the one thing to remember is that they might be wrong."</p><br><p>With which Le Grand responds, "On the contrary, Picard, you can be absolutely certain that I will remember that and I will not forget it."</p><br><p><em>-- Eliezer Yudkowsky, Politics is the Mind-Killer. Politics is also Goodhart's Law, in the case of arguments over political policies.</em></p><br><p>http://\xe2\x80\x8blesswrong.com/\xe2\x80\x8blw/\xe2\x80\x8bgg2/\xe2\x80\x8bpolitics_is_the_mind-killer/\xe2\x80\x8b</p><br><blockquote>
<p>This is a place to have fun discussing politics! But it's a place where it's especially important to be careful that you're not talking about someone trying to change policy <em>in order to improve the world</em>.</p>
