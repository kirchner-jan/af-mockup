A lot on how good epistemic norms are built.</p><br><p>Epistemic Norms Are Important</p><br><p>Your epistemic standards are highly correlated with your success, and are necessary to being a good person, whether or not they are 'necessary' or 'worth it.'</p><br><p>Many folks don't have clear heuristics and standards on this. If it isn't important, why care about it at all? If it is and you value a high chance of good outcomes for your own life, then you should care about it and strive to improve and refine your epistemic standards.</p><br><p>If it doesn't matter, _then you have no business looking at this. _If you are in this camp, you are doing it wrong.</p><br><p>Your epistemics matter _for you. _If they don't matter, then you aren't taking the important factors into account and are missing out on value.</p><br><p>The more you value good outcomes, the more your standards should matter to you and how you shape your decisions.</p><br><p>Your double cruxing matters because if it's an important thing at all, it needs standards to optimize for it. Otherwise you're not even on the right page.</p><br><p>Double Crux Works Because Norms are Critical</p><br><p>People who are norm-abiding and rule abiding also seem to have a great deal of success and are very successful people. If you know a certain person really well, you may be surprised when they aren't a good person (in certain ways relevant to your interests).</p><br><p>If you learn that they are indeed a good person in one way or another, you'll often have a lot of good to say about them and feel good about them. You'll almost feel justified <em>for not taking extra actions to get the best situation</em>.</p><br><p>This is pretty weird, and pretty dangerous, and almost never _actually true. _What's going on here is that your epistemic norms are sufficiently well-tuned to do something in particular that your intuitions are subtly wrong but can't easily describe what it might be.</p><br><p>Your intuitions are tuned for a very particular set of experiences, and they didn't know that they were missing important dimensions of human existence and would only develop an understanding and better ability to optimize once you explicitly pointed out and considered them.</p><br><p>A key part of _this kind of understanding _comes from learning the rules of normative epistemic play. Being able to point out what it felt like and thinking it through is important, but it's a key part of the value of _actually knowing where we are going, _because at the moment we're there, and it's the difference between knowing and not being able to optimize.</p><br><p>Norms are a critical part of the reason that 'double crux' works. You have to actively work to do it right in order to get it right. The whole reason it works for you is that you already have well-developed norms and practices to follow a path, if you find the path where you can learn.</p><br><p>You can get a lot of the value, and a lot of the knowledge, of double crux out of reading the blog posts, rather than the wiki article. Most of the value is knowing what the rules are, and what they're for.</p><br><p>The Wiki Article is for Double Crux as a Schema</p><br><p>This is also something that is not necessarily valuable to the point that one wants to do it properly or get the best version. The best place to find good epistemic norms, in large part, is looking at how other people do it.</p><br><p>I strongly recommend taking the opportunity to look at the wiki article for Double Crux for what it's worth, but not as something you should _actually read in order to double crux. _This is a Schema for when you have good epistemic norms already, and want to use it to point out other good epistemic norms. That's the big thing here.</p><br><p>The wiki article isn't very long, with good sections on "Good faith", "Communication", and "Clarification", but no sections to go digging through, to understand what's going on with such claims or the person's underlying logic or model.</p><br><p>When I do 'double crux,' I'm reading from the paper version, not the wiki version; reading a particular blog post rather than the wiki version, and not the original article.</p><br><p>Mostly, Double Crux Is What Happens When Your Disagreements Aren't About Disagreement</p><br><p>There's an old joke that the best way to know if you're really disagreeing about facts is if you can't even see the argument you disagree on. People often explicitly say something like that. One of the big disagreements most people have is how to go about deciding on an issue. One of the most common modes of disagreement is over what the real issue is, and how to talk to find out what's in fact true. A lot of the time, it's not really about the disagreement at all, they're simply asking questions in various ways that people think cause the other party to appear opposed when they weren't. That's great, you can learn things, but it's worth being aware of how often 'disagreement' is in fact about asking good questions with a particular frame, rather than trying to find out the truth about the issue at hand. This is a lot like 'having a mind-killer.' It's often a good norm to be _open and curious _about what other people think in terms of finding out important facts you disagree about or what a better course of action might be. You can use your double crux skills to help, or even ask for them.</p><br><p>On the one hand, saying that both sides want it to be more accurate but that the disagreement is about the framing or question asked is both the most likely (even a majority) perspective _and _the one with the most value when it's resolved properly.</p><br><p>On an epistemic level, there's almost no value in 'double cruxing' if you don't actually care about the truth, or at least care about _some _truth. Thus, saying you believe an argument is a crux is almost always evidence that you don't understand the issues at hand much and want to learn more but that you are _not _open to changing your mind or being convinced by what someone else believes.</p><br><p>On that level, disagreement is about disagreements all the time. The 'double cruxers' do it because they know that they value having accurate beliefs and that it's important for their own life, but it has _value for them _or at least _information value. _You can use it to learn and become more accurate, and in some circumstances it can get you there. But if the disagreement is mostly about what to ask, or what frame to ask the question in, then it's not clear that 'double cruxes' provide much value in those places.</p><br><p>The disagreement about what to do and how to act is, to a much greater extent than about the issues at hand, the _primary _issue at play. Both parties want the _right answer _and what they want to do with the result, the _true _and _correct _answers, but at a deeper level it's _not _the disagreement.</p><br><p>A proper double crux consists of _realizing _that all these questions are being asked in a particular frame to get to the right answer rather than about the answer.</p><br><p>I have a bunch of thoughts on improving and refining one's Double Crux skills, and sharing my models there and perhaps in this post. As usual, this is for those who want to get more right. If you care mostly about the epistemic norms and 'double cruxiness' that already exists, or already know and find it valuable, I would much rather someone read one of my posts and update on them, rather than a generic 'double crux.'</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
