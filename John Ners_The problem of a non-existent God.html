It doesn't matter whether you know it or not, it does. That is the default condition for everything, that the world exists, is governed by the same laws of physics, is the same thing every day. Even if you don't know it, know it. In order to deny that is to deny reality. There is no way to prove that you are an exception and not a rule. This is a well known thing, and all good thinking minds should know about it. Or you're not a good thinker and you're not trying hard enough to think rationally.</p><br><p>Yet those who do not give up belief in a Creator do not have a good answer, and they all seem to think that their rationalist friends share the same problem. That seems to be the case. The question everyone needs to answer is why you are still thinking of God, when everything says you are not smart for believing in a non-existent deity.</p><br><p>What I have noticed is that people's reasons for believing in God differ. There is a huge spectrum to be found between religions (most people have some belief in an "intelligent being" or an invisible guy in the sky, and most people think they believe in a supernatural force, most think they believe in the literal word of God) and those not religions (the idea that they believe in God is a strange one in the first place). On the other hand, those reasons why people believe in God are the same. I am going to be looking at those here in an attempt to build some sense of what all the different sides of that spectrum consist of.</p><br><p><strong>Atheism, Rationalism, and theism</strong></p><br><p>In the first place, I am being as unadversarial as possible, and I'm going to assume that the reader is not an atheist. The first step in this journey is to know you have a problem with believing that God exists. Or even believing a non-natural entity of some sort. The third most reasonable answer is "Why shouldn't I?" There is a way out, but it's a very specific way out. You have to give up your belief in the deity. Or at least the part of your religion that says you are not a theist. This is a rather severe step, but it does exist, and most believers in God are willing to make the commitment to it.</p><br><p>The third explanation for believing in a God is to say that you believe in God because you have to be a part of your community. People believe in a God that cares about what you do, and he rewards or punishes you for your actions, according to his morals and what he thinks are your morals. This is a community-centric form of God, and is the most common way for people to believe in God, with most of the rest of them being more or less religious in some sense.</p><br><p><strong>Other people</strong></p><br><p>Most people that don't believe in God believe they don't think they know better than a "God who is invisible and always answers prayers". Many people that agree on some questions with those people are still theists by virtue of having some idea of what "God" or "morality" refers to.</p><br><p><strong>God and the universe</strong></p><br><p>Most atheist philosophers in this discussion do not actually believe in the notion of "God" that people have in mind. People are more likely to use "God" when they want to make some sort of argument about "morals", "good and evil", "free will", "creation", or other concepts that have some relationship with God, because using those concepts is what people are familiar with, even if they are not theists. People who are atheist philosophers may still have opinions about what "morality", "free will" mean, but they will know that those terms do not have anything to do with God, and so will attempt to draw analogies to them to show that things about "morality" do relate to things that are part of the laws of the universe, or the laws of some abstract machine (the "axioms") that describe the universe. Theists tend to think about God as the source of "good and evil" (whatever that means), and think about the laws that God follows as the rules.</p><br><p>Most atheists would be hard pressed to make a strong case that "good and evil exist in the universe" because there is no good reason to think that such things must be the result of a supernatural god or of some entity existing outside the universe.</p><br><p><strong>Is God real?</strong></p><br><p>Most popular Atheist ideas seem to be that one can't be sure about that question, that it may be meaningless, or that one must assume the worst case when evaluating the possibilities, or whatever. One could also consider God to be the cause of "good and bad". One could also claim that God is real, and that "good and bad" exists as a result of God, or is a result of God. God being good, or God being evil are also not very strong claims, but one could make them.</p><br><p><strong>The problem</strong></p><br><p>Most atheists I know do not have a problem with God being real, or with God being the cause of things in the universe. They all agree on the question of whether God exists. They all agree that such questions are meaningless at the present time. They disagree, based on how they define and reason, about whether there is a reasonable way to believe that God exists. If a theist says God is a supernatural entity that exists outside the universe, an atheist could respond that even if you have a supernatural entity that is outside the universe, so what? This could be done many times within the same religion that already knows that God exists outside the universe. God still needs to explain how God relates to morality and free will and other stuff.</p><br><p>Atheists who are more rational know they need to deal with the question of whether "God" exists, but they still know that God doesn't exist, and they still believe in "God" in the same sense that most atheists do. It is only people who believe without certainty that the concept is meaningless, or can't be evaluated rationally, or who seem to be claiming that God does exist but is not a supernatural entity that cares about actions.</p><br><p><strong>Solutions?</strong></p><br><p>The solution, that I am using, would be to declare the concept of "God" meaningless. Any statement that one can make about "morality", or "free will", and the like, can only be made about them by someone who is already a "theist". Those terms refer to a concept that exists because of a God, and is not merely an emergent property of the universe; an intelligent agent, or an agent inside an intelligent agent that have the beliefs that correspond to morality, free will, etc. Because once again, if one uses the term "morality" to refer to the laws of some other intelligent agent, that's a meaningless statement. In some sense it is equivalent to saying that that agent has a God.</p><br><p>Or if it turns out that "morality" exists in an agent inside an agent, as a result of an infinite series of agents who don't know the next one, or as a result of a series of "agents that are only approximately smart enough to know the next one" or the laws of physics... well, there still has to be some agent or agent inside an agent who has those beliefs.</p><br><p>This does not mean that such beliefs are meaningless, however it does mean that it can be very useful to model the world with agents who have the types of beliefs you consider "good". They are not meant to be literally the best model of the world, but rather a fairly good model. And that model can explain things that otherwise might be explained, and explainations can also be discovered later, by the model. This in turn means that the agents in the model do not need to have perfect beliefs about reality, they only need to be sufficiently good, on average. If that model has enough agents in it with the right beliefs about God, the answer to the original question could be "yes", for example. It seems that our universe and our physical laws are such that we could have these types of agents and the questions would remain meaningless.</p><br><p>So now you can consider God to be defined within the same ontology as "morality". It could be that God is defined as one of the agents in an infinite series of "agents smarter than me" (maybe humans, maybe not, but it does not matter) and God has those moral concepts and intuitions because they allow the agents that contain him to achieve the highest evolutionary fitness. God does not need to be more than a sufficiently complex simulation of morality, not even with a god outside the simulations, if you say it's meaningless to talk about "God" and "morality" exist because of "God" and even then as long as one of the "agents smarter than God" does it, or the laws are such that it makes sense for such agents to be evolved, it still works.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
