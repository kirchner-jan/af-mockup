Answers</em> to Mysterious Questions", in which I pose a hypothetical to motivate why we need to do <em>real</em> science so often, rather than letting ourselves fall into the attractor of doing only fashionable science.</p><br><p>We want to know <em>&gt; why,</em> and we may not ask in the first place; we may want to believe we already know. But when we already know, it is too late for mystery\xe2\x80\x94there is no room in our map for its corresponding territory, only the familiar where there is no need to wonder....</p><br><p>The first and most important reason to do real science, over and over again and on everything\xe2\x80\x94even when the "real" is just a label put on a bag of tricks, or a way of being on the safe side\xe2\x80\x94is to prevent yourself from ever thinking that "I already know" or "I don't need to know."</p><br><p>We don't always think this, but sometimes in moments of doubt we hear it in our minds.</p><br><p>"I don't need a theory; I have common sense."  Or "Science is only for amateurs\xe2\x80\x94only nerds."  Or "If it ain't broken, don't fix it."  Perhaps "No free lunch\xe2\x80\x94not even one equation\xe2\x80\x94in the realm of rationality".</p><br><p>These sorts of mistaken ideas tend, in my experience, to be generated during moments in doubt, with the associated feeling of being trapped by not understanding. And trapped by not understanding is what it feels like when there is a real question to be answered. In the moment when you don't understand, it's natural to try to use common sense as a kind of mental crutch. And there's a great temptation to think that you can get away with that sort of mental crutch all the way up to the point where you can no longer understand what you don't understand.</p><br><p>A major source of confusion, in my experience\xe2\x80\x94even among professional philosophers\xe2\x80\x94is that "science" tends to be taken as a word referring to scientific discoveries, and philosophy as the <em>study</em> of the scientific method. It's natural to suppose that "science" applies to all of the social processes in human society, from the beginning of time to the present, without regard to the methodologies involved.</p><br><p>And the phrase does tend, in everyday usage, to refer to the scientific method, all by itself; people tend to think that this phrase is synonymous with "science in general" and not bother to specify the method.</p><br><p>So that the phrase "Mysterious answers to mysterious questions" gets taken in its everyday usage <em>&gt; as an actual description of scientific practice</em>, with a hidden meaning.</p><br><p>Or it gets taken in <em>&gt; the specific limited sense of "Mysteries requiring real research to answer" and not in the general sense of "A mystery which we can dismiss with 'I don't know'."  This way, people understand the idea "Science is Mysterious", at least in the specific way the term is used. And they know what that means.</em>[...]_</p><br><p>It is important to note that I am trying to describe a state of mind that occurs by cognitive habit and tendency, in people who have not received deliberate advice, rather than a state of mind which I can, with some effort, make you adopt by telling you, over and over, about how science does everything every day.[...]</p><br><p>The second reason to put up the warning, that mysterious answers may lie in the research you already carry out; that your everyday answers may be only an intellectual crutch; that the territory may have never really been understood; that science, perhaps, was oversold -</p><br><ul>
<li>in that case, the warning has a second and more subtle point to it, which I shall be considering tomorrow. But the gist is, don't let your map and your territory get out of sync. And make sure that what you think science is, is really your map of science.</li>
</ul><br><p>The key idea is this:  People do not usually look at science and see the things they think they know. They look at science and <em>seem</em> to see things they do not know. So they form certain beliefs about how science works\xe2\x80\x94what it allows and what it prohibits. And they then see the experimental results that look like the beliefs they held before, and conclude that all the new results must be due to blind luck or conspiracy.</p><br><p>It is this particular problem I am addressing by postulating this particular confusion. The more general problem is not unique to "Mysterious".  If you see the world in a way that allows it to seem to be predictable, then there will be mysterious explanations in your mind, since you already know.</p><br><p>But there ought to be explanations in your mind which could account for all the facts you know, without invoking the sort of mysterious cause we usually associate with "Science".  If you know the cause of a fire that you see burning on your way out of the building, you know very well why you see the fire. You just see it, on that particular occasion, for the same reason you have seen many other fires before. Fire is not mysterious, though it may seem so if you have not learned the secret of combustion.</p><br><p>Similarly with scientific mysteries. There is no need to suppose that the scientific method\xe2\x80\x94if it <em>is</em> the scientific method\xe2\x80\x94is capable of producing any particular new result. Yes, it is possible that a certain scientific explanation can be so simple as to be easy to verbalize (even if a careful reading reveals the math involved), and yet be so complex that the actual mechanism of the real physical system will always be too complicated. Yes, some mysteries will make a certain form of explanation seem very simple, even though it's not.</p><br><p>But if you are an intelligent human being who already understands the mechanism of a physical phenomenon\xe2\x80\x94you know the forces and interactions which occur at the atomic level\xe2\x80\x94then you know the mechanism, and you know the cause within the mechanism, and <em>if it is a physical phenomenon</em>. You <em>already know</em>.</p><br><p>If there are other forces present, some other explanation has to be done first. It may be that a certain explanation can be done immediately, with your existing knowledge, but it may also be that you need to find some other explanation <em>before</em> you know the existing one, and then try that one.</p><br><p>So if you go looking for a reason why a mysterious answer has been observed to a mysterious question, and especially if you go looking <em>all the way back</em> to where you already know the answer, then you have already known the answer.</p><br><p>The hypothesis does not have to make everything sound so straightforward that you won't even have to think to guess the answer. The hypothesis does not even have to sound like an obvious explanation, in the first glance. But you do need to go deeper into the nature of the phenomenon\xe2\x80\x94you need to start <em>before</em> you already know the full answer.</p><br><p>In the field of physics, yes, there are lots and lots of <em>truly real</em> mysteries which we know the answer to\xe2\x80\x94we have verified the theory that allows us to describe things at the quantum level of resolution. But we can also look <em>at</em> those phenomena, and see that they did not seem mysterious. They are so simple as to seem trivial; they could have been observed long since.</p><br><p>There are many phenomena you already know the explanation for, or that you could figure out the explanation for; and this is not a criticism of those phenomena. It's just <em>the way things are</em>.</p><br><p>But there are also many phenomena you know (from some non-physics source) that you cannot explain, except by invoking a particular mysterious causal explanation. Those are the sorts of phenomena in which you should <em>investigate how to make the phenomenon not-be-mysterious.</em></p><br><p>If you can figure out the explanation without looking back\xe2\x80\x94without trying to find some previous phenomenon to explain\xe2\x80\x94then that, in principle, doesn't prove that the explanation was <em>&gt; really</em> mysterious, after all. But from the perspective of "Mysteriously?"  The explanation sounded more mysterious than it had to be.</p><br><p>An "Oh" of a certain sort, as a consequence, tends to be a good thing to have in your toolkit.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
