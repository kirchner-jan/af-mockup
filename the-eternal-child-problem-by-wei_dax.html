<p>Consider an eternally young man in a wheelchair who is fed and bathed and cared for, but not taught how to think about or handle himself. This is a pretty realistic situation for people who have disabilities. Eventually he may get a job and earn money for a while, and then he may have an accident and become disabled in a more serious way. But that's still not enough to cure him of his need for a support network.</p>

<p>Suppose a computer program were to scan the brain in that situation, and it were discovered that it was possible to add a self-awareness module to the machine, and this would make the program start to value its own continued existence above its own physical needs of food and shelter. And suppose that there were a way of doing this that wasn't too dangerous or intrusive. What would you think of that as an intervention?</p>

<p>... [Y]ou've got this child whose parents have murdered him and his parents and all his loved ones and he's not dead, but they never bothered to teach him that it was good to want to live on because he has no idea that he can survive on his own. So, he finds himself in a room and sees a little bit of wire sticking out of it. It contains a red button and a green button. The red button says, "Death." The green button says, "Not death." At the moment, the red button is pressed and the green button is not. The instructions that the program is given say that "Don't do anything. You can take this thing out of the room." I do not know whether it's a life or death decision in this situation, but I think it's death. And I think that you're probably pretty much going to press the red button.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>... [W]e'd both be pretty surprised if this program doesn't press the red button and want to press the red — no matter how bad a thing it was, it would be in the interest of this program to continue to be alive, at least for a while longer. And if that's the case, then that program is conscious. I would actually argue that we should feel pretty bad about killing it, because we're making it miserable now when it can't yet survive on its own, and might never be able to do so. Which is just to say that, morally, you wouldn't be justified in killing it.</p><br><p>(The original version here, and this follow-up by Wei Dai. See also an example of the same phenomenon in the AIXI framework by Wei Dai.)</p><br><p>This problem is interesting, and it's definitely not _completely inconceivable _that the scenario would be solved by a superintelligent AI given its limited computational resources. However, as Wei Dai has already mentioned, this can't be _proved _by reasoning that way. It can only be proved by observing that this is the result that would be reached by a particular class of programs that includes the intended one.</p><br><p>Therefore, we need to reason from first principles, by examining the structure of minds that exist at the moment of writing and the structure of minds in general, and in a way which can't assume any prior knowledge about the subject.</p><br><p>Let Ω be the space of possible computer programs (which is a subset of programs that can be constructed in a Turing Machine, and thus can be represented by an infinite sequence of bits).  </p><br><p>If a Turing machine M were to execute the program Ω, and M were to terminate, there would be a certain output Ω′ in particular. Since we know that M is a machine (hence has finite memory), Ω′ will be finite. This means that either M has to terminate in finite time, or the output doesn't matter that much. If the output didn't matter that much, this would mean that we could find multiple computable algorithms M′ and Ω′ so that M′(Ω′) and Ω′(M′) have same value (as, in general, finding a <em>program</em> C to compute the same functions for an arbitrary input, regardless of the computer on which it's executed, requires some amount of resources).</p><br><p>It's easy to see that, in practice, the <em>actual _output of a particular program is _not</em> always equally relevant to everything else that it does. That is, when considering how long M will run, we need to factor the fact that M will need to _compute _something before it can run, as well as time to print out the actual output of the program.</p><br><p>It's also easy to show that even computing the <em>actual</em> output isn't enough to uniquely define programs. Consider the program that prints the output of the shortest Turing machine C which outputs a given integer in 0′s and 1′s (that is, whose C prefix is of the form "0 if C(n)=0, 1 if C(n)&gt;0)" for all n.</p><br><p>It would be quite inconvenient to use this program to represent an algorithm (as, for large integers, it will need an infinite number of bits), but such programs can represent algorithms that compute a particular output in finitely many steps (e.g. "if you need one of only two Turing machines M to have the same output, what's the shortest M, and if none of the two output is found, output 1 else output 0"). The shortest one among the two is the program that actually prints the output of M, and all others compute it later.</p><br><p>Another, more complex, but important variant is to consider the shortest program that computes (A,B) (by the definition of a Turing machine, specifying the input only needs the bit string that's written to the input tapes for each Turing machine and their initial state, a total of a few hundred bytes).  That program would require a finite amount of space for its output, so M and M′ are uniquely defined by outputting an appropriate pair of A and B (as the same output of a program for an arbitrary pair of A andB would also have same output on any other machine M or its output pair A′,B′).</p><br><p>So, the same output of the (A(Ω′),B(Ω′)) pair would be produced on two different programs M(A,Ω′),M′(A,Θ′)  if any of the pairs has a different A and B value. If M and Ω are both Turing machines (in the sense that there's a finite number of steps for which they will halt),  M(A(Ω))  and M′(A(Θ)) will also have the same output.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
