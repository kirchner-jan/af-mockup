<li>Reading the Sequences (and writing LW, CFAR, and GPT-3 posts)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Attending the Effective Altruism conference</li>

<li>Seeing more clearly than ever before my own cognitive biases
I've listed these in roughly the order of how much personal satisfaction I got from them.
Also, I've only just begun thinking about all I've learned about myself in 2019; I expect to spend the next few years reflecting more on my experiences, and on how everything I did helped shape who I am.
<em>But my personal reflection on CFAR, MIRI, the EA community, and my life generally was, as in "almost no time, and almost no reflection".</em>
Politics
I don't think I spent much time thinking, let alone writing, new posts on politics or social issues during 2019. (It was a pretty good year for me socially, professionally, and physically, so that made sense.)
I <em>did</em> spend a fair amount of time thinking, and talking privately with other people, about the following posts I wrote in 2018:</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This document, on predicting the future course of AI, is based on a lot of thinking I did with a bunch of other people last year.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The post that explained this document (and that prompted me to write it) is about how I tried to think about the question of "what's the most tractable thing I can do today in order to have the highest chance of affecting AGI in a good way?"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The main argument I presented in the post is as follows: It's pretty likely that humanity's long-term trajectory is determined in large part by the trajectory of AI in the medium term. (The main point in my original post was just that we should make a deliberate effort to steer things in a good direction; the more detailed arguments in the post are just the ones that I've come to since then.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The post I mentioned in the previous bullet point discusses what I believe are the primary strategic considerations in shaping AI development. This one is about some other considerations that I think are relevant but don't have enough space to say much about.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This discussion is about which broad trajectories seem most likely to go well. It's a brief essay that I don't really think of as a post; it's more a description of a few possibilities/​potential paths. I was looking at a list of possibilities to try to make my 2018 AI predictions.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In this discussion, I'm writing out my reasoning about the possibilities I looked at. I explain some paths which the other people I've been talking with would also endorse, but which I haven't explicitly endorsed. This isn't meant to say that my endorsement of those paths comes out of nowhere. I am quite willing, however, to change my mind about which paths seem worth considering, based on new information and new conversations.</li>
