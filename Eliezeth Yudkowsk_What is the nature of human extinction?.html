</ul><br><ul>
<li>Conclusion: is there a single event that causes extinction?</li>
</ul><br><p>When I talk about "human extinction", I don't mean a very good outcome for human beings\xe2\x80\x94not even survival, just a sort of temporary suspension of a single human species\xe2\x80\x94and <em>not</em> the Earth being taken over by alien life forms. By "human extinction," I just mean the human species no longer exists in its present form, and never will again.</p><br><p>Human extinction, then, can be caused by many different processes, and by different degrees. And the event that humans do <em>most</em> have in mind, for some of us at least, is <strong>the event of humanity itself</strong>\xe2\x80\x94that is, some other Earthly species becoming sentient and intelligent, and reaching our level of technological development, and eventually out-competing us for control over our planet's destiny.</p><br><p>This is the event that Robin Hanson calls the "big crunch," or "ultimatum game":</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Suppose an alien species is interested in how intelligent beings live. We will assume that this species is more intelligent than humans, since otherwise they could visit Earth and see what we do. Now imagine the aliens present a proposal to us: cooperate with us, and allow us to continue living. If we refuse to cooperate, then the aliens will decide whether or not to exterminate us. They could decide to exterminate us if they believe our existence will interfere with their plans for the galaxy. And this might well be the case\xe2\x80\x94for instance, suppose the aliens decide that their universe can only make sense if there are never any intelligent species, only large swaths of emptiness. In this case killing us off would be relatively inexpensive. Or, suppose these aliens decide that, like us, they are prone to anthropomorphising other life forms. Maybe they don't think that we deserve consideration because we are so very close to extinction ourselves. Or imagine that they consider the possibility of our being "saved" by another life form that they consider friendly. In this case, the cost to them of exterminating us might be very high. It all depends on the aliens' value system.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Is this how human extinction occurs? I think a better understanding of "human extinction" is necessary before you can answer. If you can answer it correctly, you may be able to make a positive prediction for the future\xe2\x80\x94if it occurs, whether or not you can make a successful effort to stop it. So this is a question I must ask, at some point, if I want to work on Friendly AI or other x-risk issues; it is not <em>optional</em>.</p><br><p>I think this question is even more important than "What happens after human extinction?", for human extinction may indeed be possible some day. But there are a few ways in which an intelligence explosion could kill us without killing our descendants, and they seem worth understanding in detail.</p><br><p>"Human species" vs mankind as a whole</p><br><p>The first way I can imagine human extinction occurring, is in a way that benefits humankind as a whole. Perhaps our children's children will understand the history we were just living, and think about the implications for them, from a human perspective. Or perhaps, if our civilization is doomed, their civilization will be doomed too; better to be sure of that, than to have that option be open to humanity.</p><br><p>In this case, it's not that humanity is <em>wrong</em>\xe2\x80\x94it would be better for our children's children to know our history than to go unrecorded. But from the human perspective, it doesn't feel <em>wrong.</em> There's no <em>disintegration</em>, no <em>collapse</em>, no nothing. It's just humankind as a whole\xe2\x80\x94our future light cone\xe2\x80\x94no longer exists.</p><br><p>This seems to me a potentially very difficult case to handle if you are trying to be a Friendly AI. For if Friendly AI requires <em>being</em> the <em>one</em> that <em>still exists</em>, then it seems that our children's children are not in the same position as, say, our distant ancestors on Earth. They are no longer the same "I." They don't feel as if they <em>could</em> still exist, even if they chose to do so.</p><br><p>Anthropomorphizing extinction</p><br><p>I'm not talking about the <em>specific</em> future history that follows from humanity being utterly wiped out. I'm talking about humanity as a <em>whole.</em> And that seems to me to have a greater degree of permanence than humanity as a whole, even if we can't exactly say how it is in principle different. If I <em>could</em> make a Friendly AI that could help future humans to "wake up" from the catastrophe, <em>in principle</em>, at least some of them would feel as if they could still exist even if they chose so to be.</p><br><p>It sounds simple, but that may not mean that it's really simple, or that you can understand it any easier than you do now. It's hard to visualize this way.</p><br><p>In a sense, I think this anthropomorphizes human extinction. We imagine a lonely final moment of humanity\xe2\x80\x94not "humanity as a whole" having died, but <em>just</em> humanity\xe2\x80\x94and we think of <em>that</em> as if it were a lonely final moment for a personal species.</p><br><p>Perhaps it's no big deal after all. If you were to live from now until the Big Crunch, your children's children's children will remember your existence, even though you do not. It is true to say that you <em>would</em> still be there for them to see humanity alive, and for humanity as a whole to be what it eventually became. It feels <em>possible</em> that our grandchildren's grand-grandchildren's descendants will still make the same kind of choices that our children's descendants made, even after human extinction. If you can see humanity as it was, you can see that humanity was ever-present in its entirety, that it will ever continue to exist as a whole.</p><br><p>Perhaps you can imagine our descendants continuing to exist even without us; after all, even if humans no longer existed, our planet Earth would still be there. Perhaps this anthropomorphization is also a big deal after all\xe2\x80\x94if you could <em>see</em> Earth, it seems like even after your extinction, Earth would still be present.</p><br><p>I don't see any reason, though, why anthropomorphizing the extinction of <em>this</em> Earth, must have the same implications as anthropomorphizing the <em>total</em> extinction of humanity. Perhaps our descendants will make similar or even the same choices; we just want to make sure that if that's true, it's because we chose to.</p><br><p>Or maybe you can <em>feel</em> from the inside, as if you exist <em>tomorrow</em>\xe2\x80\x94if your future light cone continues, no matter how large it is.</p><br><p>But you can't <em>feel</em> that for all of humanity, if you only imagine a single member of humanity whose future light cone is erased forever. Even if that future light cone really did remain, it would no longer be <em>human life</em> as you <em>now _conceive of it. You would no longer _know</em> what it means to be human, what it's like to be a human, no matter what happens to humanity in the future. You would no <em>feel</em> that the humanity you were thinking about was still there, would still be able to be <em>you.</em> The feeling that humanity as a whole will remain, and you as part of that humanity, would come from the fact that you <em>know</em> that humanity as a <em>single</em> future-moment will exist forever\xe2\x80\x94the feeling that, as long as the universe <em>is</em>, and at least <em>humans</em> continue to exist, then humanity as a whole continues to exist.</p><br><p>And this is why I've been discussing ways in which anthropomorphizing extinction seems wrong: because it anthropomorphizes this particular way that humanity <em>as a whole</em> can experience humanity <em>as a species</em> experiencing <em>its</em> last moment of existence forever\xe2\x80\x94an anthropomorphization based on the idea of a future <em>you</em> knowing the answer to the question, "What does it feel like?" and having made that determination in advance.</p><br><p>And it seems to me that this anthropomorphizing extinction of mankind as a whole is not the end of humanity as a whole. Not just at any particular future moment, but in principle, as long as human beings continue to exist on <em>any</em> planet, they will have been a part of a planet they've seen ever-flourishing humanity as a whole on\xe2\x80\x94even if that planet goes cold and dark forever.</p><br><p>It would be better in a sense\xe2\x80\x94though it would be sad in another sense\xe2\x80\x94if everyone who ever lived were dead, so that we can all be together in one place, at once, even in the cold and darkness. Imagine if every star in our Hubble volume were a nuclear explosion, so that at the exact moment that all living things there abruptly disappear forever from the universe, it is <em>our own</em> moment of existence that <em>just happens</em> to be there.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
