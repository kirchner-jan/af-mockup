It might be that you have no more than the ability to describe a single answer, and the second one is logically incoherent.</p><br><p>You are not alone there.</p><br><p><em>Theodicy</em> may not even be a real word.</p><br><p>Most people get around it somehow. They say something like "Well, I dunno, I guess it's sorta about helping people, but it's more 'nice' if he helps all people equally."So let's talk about <em>Malthusian equilibria</em>.If you're a religious person and not a Malthusian equilbrian, this is a <em>very good thing</em>. Malthusian thinking is a good thing!</p><br><p>But you can't find a lot about Malthus in the writings of the more famous religious thinkers. His name is invoked only as a cautionary tale. "That's why the Catholic Church rejected the Protestant doctrine of predestination, and the two camps were locked in eternal animosity till the mid-nineteenth century."So people don't take those warnings <em>all that seriously</em>, and look them up only if they're specifically looking for a quote against Malthus as an atheist. If we want to be rigorous, all we can do is quote <em>The Gift We Give To Tomorrow</em>. I shall copy the quote verbatim (from chapter XI) and then discuss it for the tenth time.__&gt; "We must not be surprised if men's efforts prove futile against the tremendous forces of Nature, but we must not expect them to succeed." -Thomas Malthus__Malthus' predictions were mostly right. There is a growing population. Most people are still relatively poor. There is a <em>lot more food</em>, to be sure, but it all takes a lot of labor from many people, and in many places that labor is in short supply. In the developed world, many people are <em>mostly unemployed</em>, despite lots of new goods and a high standard of living. (Not literally <em>not</em> all, of course, since sometimes people want to work, but the basic idea is still there.)It is indeed shocking that someone said this 2,500 years ago, and then it happened.But when reading Malthus, my immediate response is to <em>not</em> be surprised if this happens in the future. If I read his book with that in mind, the book begins: "If we do not ourselves repent, the consequences may be even worse than a war among the nations."  So not only do I already know that my readers are going to think it's a good thing anyway, I already <em>expect</em> them to be skeptical of my arguments.Malthus is famous for being wrong about lots of things. But even on relatively more accurate predictions, like how soon we would run out of arable land or water or something, Malthus' track record was still pretty bad. Let's look at <em>The Gift We Send To Tomorrow</em>'s predictions for things that Malthus could <em>not</em> have known.For example, let's follow Malthus' thinking on population growth. He writes, early in the book: "The population as we have hitherto inhabited the country, is the mean of a continuance of a uniform population or its first approximation, to which I have assigned the name Malthusian situation".  So how well had people in the time of <em>Gift</em> done on this?Well, his predictions about population growth: they were <em>mostly right</em>! There was a good deal of immigration from Ireland and Scotland \xe2\x80\x93 and it did indeed have an effect "to raise the population."  But overall, the British and American people were mostly in a Malthusan situation. It takes as much labor as can be found, and the population grows, but the labor supply does not grow with the population. It seems Malthus <em>would have been surprised</em> if a population grew at 1.2 percent per year but people <em>still had a job</em>.  ____The only reason people don't run out of jobs is that <em>lots of people want the jobs</em>, so when there are not enough good jobs for everyone, desperate people go <em>elsewhere</em> to get jobs.And how did Malthus know the US and the UK would be so different? Malthus is famous (unlike many in his time) for his deep interest in the English countryside and his deep interest (on the side of England) in the American Midwest. And by Malthus' time these were some of the most dynamic and lucrative places for agriculture. So Malthus would have had strong reason to believe this \xe2\x80\x93 and for it to also have happened.In fact, Malthus would probably have been <em>surprised</em> if a country like Ireland that had not been devastated by the Great Famine of the 19th century had not had an influx of thousands of emigrants, who themselves were from one of the more dynamic economies of the world. It was the Irish Civil War of 1919-1921 that began the first large-scale population growth in Britain.The best thing about Malthus' book is that it gives us a way to judge whether people who disagreed with him were in fact wrong \xe2\x80\x93 by looking at how many predictions the author <em>wouldn't have been surprised</em> by later.If so many people disagreed with Malthus' prediction that "There is no limit to the multiplication of human beings", I'm not sure I'd need quotes from later commentators.</p><br><p>How about the modern-day world?Malthus was a Christian moralist, of course, and Christian moralities had to take a <em>lot</em> of moral-antagonistic conclusions as a result of the progress of science. He would have been surprised if not-for-the-sake-of-punishment. He also would have been a little disappointed if people <em>did</em> manage to get rid of all diseases, and still weren't doing well.But he would have <em>also</em> be pretty sad and surprised if people are <em>still</em> doing okay, with everyone enjoying the luxury he called "happiness".</p><br><p>Malthus wrote: "To be able to feed and clothe a population of two thousand pounds sterling per head would necessitate one hundred and fifty-six million pounds six shillings and four pence, which is only seventeen thousand pounds a year per man".  This works out to a hundred and fifty shillings per man per day. The median US GDP per capita was $39,000 in 2006, so that's $3.46 per man per day, or $15.94 per <em>year</em>.Now in the early twenty-first century, and with <em>much</em> more per-capita income than the average Malthusian in 1700, the cost of human welfare is <em>much huger</em> than in Malthus' predictions. And in fact we now spend about <em>three times</em> as much per person on human welfare as Malthus predicted.It may not be good that we had to wait so long for this to happen, but I guess it worked out for the best in the end.What would Malthus think of our society's ability to meet its own needs for food, shelter, and clothing?Malthus' book was published in 1798, before the industrial revolution had really started, and the cost of food had only really increased about three times. So I'd have to guess that Malthus would not have predicted the US would have so much food supply. But he <em>would</em> have predicted that <em>more people</em> would be <em>so much better</em> for farming.How often must I quote Thomas Malthus' <em>Gift</em> with those caveats attached? I could just quote all the chapter titles, and the introduction and the preface:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>The world we have now is the fruit of great revolutions in human history. These revolutions are not always good. There have been times in almost any of the past phases of human society which have been marked by greater evils than famine, pestilence, or war. These eras of suffering are the work of a natural course of political and economic development; and if the great revolutions which we are now passing through turn out to be only too well timed to our condition, we should be warned by their past instances that they may at some future critical period involve us in their consequences. If they had taken place earlier, at other critical periods in the past history of the world, there would not have been a history of humanity....&gt; It is only a very few men indeed who, in the course of ordinary lives, are actuated by the ambition to do more than most other men have done; who are so elevated in the scale and character of their views as to wish to share in the vastness, if not in the benefits of mankind, at least in the _happiness</em> of their fellows.&gt; Many and many a man would do that much too, and it would be well if all mankind could be so constituted that every age should be filled with such men._</p>
