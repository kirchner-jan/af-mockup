<blockquote>
<p>The first programmable digital computers were electronic brains. In the 1960s and '70s, they did numerical calculations. Computers running in the vacuum tube era are one level below a brain because their circuitry—that is, their circuitry can be described as programmable "motor speed"—is the same as in a person.The first computers to be described as capable of taking any input and being able to produce any output the user could describe were, in the end, very limited in their capacity to process complex information, so were very restricted in their usefulness. These were, then, the first computers that might be described as "not human." But these computers were still "very human." They could run programs written in the languages of their day. They could run programs on problems they were given by a user to solve. But they had not taken their first big steps out of the atmosphere or out of their rooms.
In the latter part of the 1960s and most of the 70s, many computer scientists would say that computer science had reached its zenith.
The world's best computer program for 1971 is IBM Corporation's IML, a program for simulating and solving partial differential equations. That program is considered by computer scientists to be human-level, that is, computer-science experts consider a human running this machine to be the same in power and capacity as a human to carry out complex problem-solving tasks.... This machine is said to be one of the most powerful computers ever built. In 1971, it could simulate a single human brain for 100 years.... A single simulation is said to be the same as one "real brain."... As far as computer scientists are concerned, IML was an extraordinary achievement which no other computer could ever exceed.A new kind of computer started to emerge. Not from an improved version of a "human-level" computer but from an improved understanding of how to build even better computers. This new kind of computer is a different kind of computer. It's not just that its hardware is better, or its software is better, or even that all of these things have improved together. There is a new kind of computer under development that can be described as not just a new software and hardware combination for problem solving, but as a new kind of software and hardware combination.
... This machine can simulate human brains on a scale which we all think of as impossible; it can simulate whole cities; and even though computer scientists think a simulated city would be a little bit larger than a real city, it is said to be a computer whose output is as powerful as what it is said to simulate. The machine is not yet said to be as human as a human. It's not there yet. But the machine's software is said to represent a new understanding of computer hardware and software....
(emphasis mine)The new kind of computer starts its development not from a "better and better" version of a previous computer, but from an improved ability to build computers. Such computers are said to be "Minimum Versionable Products" or MVPs! In the year 1979, an article about the development of the microprocessor describes how the idea of putting all the functionality into the chip became the dominant approach. By 1998, the article goes on to describe chips as "so powerful" they "are not just for playing video games, but can compute complex business procedures just as well as a supercomputer."

</blockquote><br><p>A note about the power of general purpose computers.  The author explains:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>A general-purpose machine, which uses only standard parts, is so complex that it can only use a small fraction of our own hardware potential in performing any computation. Most computations are simply beyond its power. Yet a general-purpose computer is, and has been, the most important part of the economy's data processing capacity—and has played a critical role in all information technologies.It's now a truism that general purpose computers were once regarded as supercomputers, but I'd say it's also one of the more shocking facts (to me at least) about the development of computer science. In the early part of the 20th century, it was not considered as the most efficient way to use a computer. The most efficient use of a computer was not to use it to run a program written for that computer, but instead to use it in a way that was only slightly different from the process used by the very early computers and which did not depend on the hardware being specialized for a particular task. It was, in many ways, the least efficient and most wasteful way of using a computer. This situation was changed when Moore's law took effect. The power of computers gradually increased so rapidly that it became obvious that the most expensive and technically difficult way of using a general-purpose machine is by using it to run a very particular program (albeit perhaps several variants and versions). So when a general purpose machine is used to run one particular program it is suddenly very powerful. This means there will never be an end to improving those general purpose computers, so by the time we get into the new millennium the technology will have moved to a place I would consider to be a lot like the place described by the author:</p>

<p>Now a machine is being produced that we believe to possess nearly all the power of a human brain. There is a widely held and popular belief that such a machine will be human-level in the sense that a human running on the machine is no more different from the machine's own output than the output of the human brain is different from the brain's input. There is an opinion among experts—there is a belief among the public—that such a machine may be human-level by the year 2000. This, I believe, is very early. This is the end of a great dream.But that has not happened yet.</p>
