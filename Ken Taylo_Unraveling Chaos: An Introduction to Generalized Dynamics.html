But chaos is not the absence of order: order is not predictable but predictable, and is created by the action of that which is not yet known and unknown, and that which is beyond our experience by default. As chaos expands into the territory the map of that territory also becomes more chaotic: to continue with our example, that which is the source of the chaos, or order, becomes itself chaotic in that it is in the process of emerging and creating itself from whatever base state or conditions we know to be the preconditions to its existence in the first place. That which is the source or cause of chaos appears to be beyond our control when the source or the cause appears to be the result of the workings of the preconditions that allowed chaos to arise or to become apparent, but chaos is more accurately understood as arising from the action or process of chaos and more accurately appears to be the source of chaos, just as one can more accurately understand the source of any other phenomenon as its effect. The source can create the effect, but the cause is more accurately understood because the preconditions for the actual effect become the cause, allowing another level of explanation. Chaos is the unfolding of chaos in time, of events, or of people.</p><br><p>A system that is a precondition for chaos, one that allows chaos to arise and to expand into both space and time, is a chaotic system. Such a system is unpredictable but not random, and it is precisely because it is not random that it can be predicted. A chaotic system, being unpredictable, is also what we often refer to as "chaotic."</p><br><p>Chaos has been studied from both physical and computational perspectives. The field of Chaos Theory is also referred to as Computational Chaos Theory and Chaos in Computer Science. Generalized Chaos Theory studies and explains Chaos in both the physical and computational sense and is also referred to by that name. It also relates closely to the concept of self-organizing systems and the emergence of complexity within them from chaotic action. Other related terms for Generalized Chaos Theory are: Self-Organized Criticality and Self-Organized System (also referred to as Self-organizing system which has developed beyond the critical level for the emergence of regularity or order). In a sense Chaos Theory is a branch of Generalized Theory of everything. Here it shall suffice to simply refer to both as Generalized Chaos Theory (or just "Chaos Theory") for the rest of this text. What Chaos Theory has to do with Intelligence is more subtle. Although it has not yet fully been theorized, we can see that it plays or has played an important role in the study of general intelligence. But also in studying the dynamics of communication, collaboration and creativity we find that it matters what we mean by intelligence. Thus we also need or want a way to describe and explain our notions of intelligence.</p><br><p>An intelligence or a concept or a theory of intelligence may be seen as a model to describe the dynamics or behavior of a system, or of a set of system, whose state or behavior may be considered "as being intelligent" to the extent that it allows us to better model or predict other systems by better understanding and predicting the process by which the systems arise or are generated or evolved.</p><br><p>Because we must model something and must understand something to model it, to understand something, to model or predict something we necessarily make a model of it. We model our understanding of the world in that we understand how the world appears to be because we see the effects of the interaction that is the cause of those appearances.</p><br><p>For any phenomenon that appears to be an effect of a cause, there is necessarily a cause. That cause is not always knowable, but the phenomenon itself is itself knowable and that cause is also part of the phenomenon, albeit in an embedded or emergent state. That which is part of the phenomenon and that which is the cause of the phenomenon are part of each other, and both are part of the phenomenon. Chaos is therefore a phenomenon. Chaos describes the self-organization effect in self-organizing system caused by chaos.</p><br><p>Chaos is defined as that which appears to arise spontaneously but is predictable, or which is predictable but becomes unpredictable, as a result of self-organization. Chaos arises from the self-organizing of chaos itself.</p><br><p>Self-organization is the tendency for self-organizing phenomena to self-organize. This can be seen in many instances of self-organized systems such as hurricanes, the atmosphere, evolution, economics, the stock market, science and culture generally. Chaos is self-organization of chaos.</p><br><p>It is also seen in other situations, such as in random processes such as natural disasters and the behavior of people, animals, and human or human-made institutions. The behavior of humans, animals and institutions appears to be in part the result of the chaotic action or process of humans, animals or institutions. Chaos is also apparent in systems created by humans such as in the functioning of computer networks.</p><br><p>It may be tempting to interpret chaos as a lack of intelligence in humans or institutions, or at least that the phenomenon has elements or characteristics that are not intelligently conceived. This is not the case. What appears to be intelligent behavior may in fact only be due to the effects of chaos as it takes a time or a space for the effects to emerge or appear.</p><br><p>Chao and other terms are often used for something other than chaos. To the extent that they have a distinct meaning or can be distinguished, this is a use or a misuse of the terms. As will be seen, the terms are often used interchangeably, and may be considered or treated more or less the same. This is common even within the field of Generalized Chaos Theory. This is because Generalized Chaos Theory is less specific that Chaos Theory, or Chaos in Generalized Theory.</p><br><p>Chosen from a wide variety of interpretations, what Chaos Theory has to say about intelligence is the following.</p><br><p>When we model or predict a phenomenon we necessarily model or predict the source or cause from which the phenomenon arises. Thus, whether or not a phenomenon exhibits chaotic behavior does not depend on its intelligence or intelligence but only on the structure of the phenomenon itself, i.e., the process or processes that generates it.</p><br><p>The phenomenon (chaos) that arises from the self organizing action or process of the system, that has created such a process of action or process, is itself chaotic, as chaos is unpredictable by default but can be predicted.</p><br><p>The chaotic process or phenomenon is also a phenomenon, itself, but is also both the source and effect of the process, just as is any phenomenon.</p><br><p>Therefore Chaos Theory has both a cause and an effect, but only the cause can be considered as chaotic. The effect or process is chaotic only if the cause is part of the process, whereas the cause itself which is part of or that arises from the effect is itself non-chaotic (i.e., predictable).</p><br><p>The effect can arise from the non-chaotic cause. The effect can also arise from the chaotic cause, but will then be non-chaotic. Thus the non-chaonic effects can be non-chaotropic to the extent that the cause has developed higher level structure that allows the process to emerge or to be predicted.</p><br><p>_   _</p><br><p>Chaos can also be seen by looking at the effects of the process on the structure and on other factors such as on itself, on other factors or on the conditions that make possible the action of the process or emergence of the process in the first place, factors that we may refer to as preconditions. If the process leads to chaos then the preconditions are chaotic as well and thus chaos is inevitable. The preconditions can also be the source or cause the process, in which case we call it the cause for obvious reasons. Thus Chaotic Inference is the process of inferring or determining preconditions of chaos and the effects of this chaos.</p><br><p>We can also see that chaos can develop or arise from the effects of other chaotic processes (or chaotic conditions), so that it appears that these are the cause of themselves, but this is due to the fact that they are part of the cause of the chaotic process.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
