The two terms are very very far apart. Most mathematicians are no good politicians, and most mathematicians would consider the study of politics a waste of time.</p><br><p>I think this is a very important distinction, because most people can understand that you shouldn't study some things to "fix" others, and most people can understand "intellect" is a thing that comes in handy in lots of places. But most people also can't understand that you can spend most of your time getting lots of value from studying anything other than Politics.</p><br><p>The correct usage of the word "use" here is that studying mathematics is a useful thing to do. When I say I need to study mathematical logic, or mathematical complexity theory, this is what's meant; not that I'm going to study some political philosophy because it's such a wonderfully interesting field! (Even if it is such a wonderfully interesting <em>political</em> field.)</p><br><p>The same is true of rationality; thinking systematically can be very useful for dealing with problems and making better decisions... but it's also possible that thinking systematically doesn't provide all the value you could have gotten with some other (hopefully political) approach to problem-solving and decision-making. (That's what I would guess in the case of politics; I've heard a few different sorts of arguments for why this is or isn't the case.)</p><br><p>In the same way it's a <em>wrong usage</em> to say that studying politics is useful because it's a "gateway drug" to study everything else. You can study mathematics without studying its applications. But there's no getting around the fact that mathematical logic (the study of the study of... what?) has <em>actual applications</em> and that studying those applications helps a lot.</p><br><p>If you're going to study this question\xe2\x80\x94even in part\xe2\x80\x94you need to be clear on that, or else you fall into one of five major modes of thought I've categorized:</p><br><ul>
<li>If there's any kind of "good thing" about politics, it's in helping people be "rational" about it. So if you find some sort of political philosophy compelling, you should think about why that is, and what it has to do with being rational.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If there happens to be anything good about politics, it would obviously be good to study it. I would then question the strength of that positive feeling, and whether studying it in the abstract will actually be helpful to it, and so on. (In which case, go study some math, and then come back to study the particular application of math to politics.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(And of course, all the other things one does all the time.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If there's no basis for any such conclusions, then just ignore politics entirely.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This post wasn't created to deal with these five options, so this option isn't one of them. For this I must apologize to everyone who thought I was being politically-incautious. To the extent you did, I have failed you.</li>
</ul><br><p>The point of this post isn't to say I've chosen between (1), (2), (3), and (4), or anything like that; the point is to make it very clear what's going on with "politics". The point is to help you think more clearly, or at least to make your own beliefs clearer. And hopefully making your own beliefs clearer will make it easier to argue them with others, and perhaps to change them. My best guess as to what that means is (2) above, but I'd at least want to know what other options there are.</p><br><p>Note that this post doesn't really say anything about the question of whether or not to support a particular candidate, but I suspect it might influence you somewhat in your voting decisions anyway. And the post is too short to do it justice. It needs at least one more sentence."</p><br><p>It has occurred to me over and over and over again throughout the course of many years that my reaction to the notion of "politics" is so <em>exactly right</em> I'm surprised I'm not a Democrat. This post is an example of how I can start to understand how that happens and why.</p><br><p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> Wei Dai brings up "Politics and the Psychology of Gender". In short: when I use the word "politics", I'm describing it so broadly as to include things that could hardly be called "rational". I haven't yet taken much time to write about it, but I'll do so the next time I have something better to say than "politics", rather than getting distracted by this argument.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
