</ul><br><p>As is my policy, I'm trying to make fewer assumptions than normally necessary in order to simplify discussion. In this post I'll lay out a story about how the'strong' agent and the 'weak' agent play a symmetric game with respect to flipping a coin. I'll describe a few situations where my story (or a similar story) would make more sense, and give the conditions under which I feel the differences between my story and reality get important.</p><br><p>Examples</p><br><p>In the trolley problem, there is an agent X who has the option of deciding whether to pull a lever L. If lever L is pulled, an agent Y is created, and Y takes a gamble in a way that depends on X's decision. Depending on the results of the gamble, X ends up being killed, or not. In some places, it's common to describe this as a utility-maximising agent's utility being negative; in others it's common to just say that some utility is lost. The point is that there is some amount of'strength' in deciding whether to pull L, and some amount of 'weakness' in being killed by Y (or vice versa in the other case).</p><br><p>In some situations, this seems like a reasonable situation to me\xe2\x80\x94I can see both X and Y as being moral agents, and I agree that some utility is being lost if either chooses the other to pull the lever. In such a situation, in practice the disagreement seems to be <em>between</em> X and the common-sense agents Y\xe2\x80\x94who I would describe as 'unintelligent'. For example, if X is killed and Y then lives her life unhurt (but as she knows, due to a fatal error in her programming, she has X's utility function) then, from the perspective of the common-sense Y, X should not pull the lever\xe2\x80\x94X will never recover from such a decision.</p><br><p>In this case, I think the two main disagreement points are:</p><br><ul>
<li>In general, do the moral agents see each other as moral agents, or as 'unintelligence'?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If the moral agents see themselves as being 'unintelligence', what's the difference between them?</li>
</ul><br><p>The Trolley Problem</p><br><p>So, with that background out of the way, back to the trolley problem...</p><br><p>Here's a picture I've found on the internet:</p><br><br><p>Consider what happens when we flip the coin?</p><br><p>What's the chance of X surviving? </p><br><p>Y's chance of survival is the chance that the coin lands heads; so is X's chance of survival equal to Y's chance</p><br><p>What's the expected number of Y's who live if L is pulled? X has a 50% chance of dying, so this number is equally divided between X &amp; Y; so 0</p><br><p>In this particular case, I think (as with most real-world trolley problems) the correct answer is the 'weak' one. But the basic point of the example could apply to any situation where two agents both survive, regardless of which agent survives (which is basically all situations involving flips of coins): the stronger agent is incentivised to kill the weaker 'unintelligent' agent, as long as doing so does not interfere with their own survival (and if doing so does interfere, the agent with more strength should probably choose to die instead).</p><br><p>Conclusion</p><br><p>This post is a fairly simple one, but it's one that seems to be confused all the time\xe2\x80\x94especially by those arguing for the 'weaker' side.</p><br><p>I've given one specific explanation\xe2\x80\x94how my story would explain, and why I think that explanation makes sense. That explanation is a relatively complex one, requiring some technical assumptions. Yet to the extent that my story is being used to make claims about what moral agents should 'end up doing', or what should 'actually end up happened', my assumptions can explain all the disagreement between common-sense morality and some types of 'weak' arguments for utilitarianism.</p><br><p>Further Reading?</p><br><p>In the case above, I did not do very many searches for real-world examples. Feel free to add some you found to the comments!</p><br><p>(I could probably have made this much clearer on LW, rather than only having to do it once on my own blog. I've already written a follow-up explaining in more detail that it was a useful exercise for me to write it up here.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
