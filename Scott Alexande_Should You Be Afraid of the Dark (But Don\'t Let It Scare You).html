</ul><br><p>I.</p><br><p><strong>Followup to</strong>:  The Parable of Predict-O-Matic</p><br><p>Omniscience: the power to know everything that's true. Omnipotence: the power to do anything that's true. </p><br><p>Or are those just the first two powers of an omnipotent being? It turns out that God is infinite; God is all things. Or maybe, omnibenevolent, omnicommunity, and omnisexual God, but He still has the power to create a mind even if it doesn't have that ability. What's up with him, anyway?</p><br><p>It probably helps you to imagine God's thoughts when he comes up with his list of attributes.</p><br><p>"Man! An omnipotent being who can alter any event in the natural universe! _Heck, if he was a human, even! _Aah! What kind of world am I in, here?"</p><br><p>That'll probably give you a solid first impression of God. He'd just like to introduce himself more graciously. He'd like to talk to you first about the universe he created and cares about you a great deal. He might not even call himself God. He's just the Preserver of All that exists:</p><br><p>"I'm the one who set up and then decided the parameters of the universe we live in. I took you and your friends and created you in an empty universe, with very specific laws of physics, containing life and matter. To me that is much more important than whether I have the power to turn an apple into a banana. I don't have the power to be able to change the fact that you are physically made of the same atoms as me, and I'm sure as heck not stupid enough to change my actions. So please stop being so scared of the dark, because there is no one to take your place, and no one can make you feel worse. You're still here, and you still matter, just like I do."</p><br><p>This sounds reasonable enough\xe2\x80\x94what else would God-The-Preserver-Preserve Himself be talking about? He'd just be telling you a story about how you were going to die soon, and he made sure it was part of the plan.</p><br><p>There are just two problems: 1) there isn't any reason you should believe God is telling the truth, and 2) you're not going to die soon. Or you might be, but only because it's your will to do so.</p><br><p>II.</p><br><p>The first problem is that you don't know God, and it's only possible to have that sort of omniscient knowledge by becoming God yourself, or getting someone else to talk with you. The universe, if he does have all the power he claims to, should be able to figure it out much quicker than God can, by checking the evidence.1</p><br><p>The second problem is that if you <em>did</em> have the power to die, God would just prevent you from using it, or, failing that, change the parameters of the world so that you wouldn't die.</p><br><p>I'm not saying this God isn't all-powerful and all-knowing <em>a priori</em>. I mean it <em>a priori</em> as in, assuming he's telling the truth about anything. A true omnipotent being should have had the sense, in his infinite wisdom, to just make sure your death was the last thing that happened in his universe.</p><br><p>Even if God <em>did</em> do that, why would he not care about the fact that his omnipotent being is going to die? Why would <em>no one else</em> care that there's just one lonely human who's about to meet the sun? If you had lived in a universe with only one God, rather than in a universe with trillions, perhaps you would feel less of a fear of the dark. Or you might not; you might feel the same fear as everyone else when it came to things that <em>he</em> hadn't created. And, in your own universe, you might face another god with similar thoughts: the one with all things that are and aren't theirs.</p><br><p>III.</p><br><p>Maybe you're not afraid of the dark because you know you're going to stop being afraid of the dark the instant you turn on the light. In that case, that means the "preservation" part of God's story turned out to be a lie. Even though God <em>is</em> "preserving" all of there, God is not "preserving" you any more than a candle will "preserve" your body and mind when it finally burns out.</p><br><p>But on the other hand, maybe God really is "maintaining" you; maybe He really is saying that the mere fact that you happen to exist is "sufficient" to let them preserve you.</p><br><p>What if God's story is true? What if you can't make yourself be preserved but He can?</p><br><p>It really is the sort of question that Pascal's wager gets wrong...and, from where I stand right now, Pascal's wager is right. It was wrong when Pascal wrote it, and it's still wrong today. God could have created the universe at a much earlier point; he would have been right at that time; the universe would have been right to exist at the same time. He could have created you as a random accident; God is in a million other universes too, so that's not necessarily surprising. And, in fact, if you're in the same universe as me, it's much more likely you have the power to take over and change that universe than to be created by some other god.</p><br><p>But now imagine that in his infinite wisdom God <em>is</em> telling the truth, that there <em>is</em> someone watching you die, that it <em>is</em> "sufficient" to prevent your death. Would that save you?</p><br><p>I think, personally, that <em>yes</em>, Pascal's wagering and begging for a one in a million chance of being right makes sense. If Pascal were a more honest man, he might have said "I don't know, I'm just offering you a choice between A and B, it's up to you decide." But I don't think honesty is necessary here. This is a choice between two different actions\xe2\x80\x94letting myself die and trying to change everything while I still have the chance, or remaining in the darkness forever. <em>One million to one</em> is a pretty good deal for not making a decision at all.</p><br><p>In fact, I would like to propose an "Opt-In Pascal's Wager": if I have the power and could save you from death (or at least let you live a normal, happy life in yours after you die), that should give me the permission to change the laws of physics so that you aren't killed.</p><br><p>It's a bad deal, but then again, what about if God is actually evil?</p><br><p>For example, God kills everyone in your town, but also you, when you say the wrong word. You'd think God would respect the rights of those who say the right word, no matter how much they later regret it.</p><br><p>Or God sets up a mind emulation of you that thinks it's you, but isn't really. This could be because emulation is possible even if not. Or maybe only some people in your group are emulations, while the rest are the real deal and can be manipulated into saying anything. Why would you want to live in a world where you had to take their word for things, though, especially if everyone's being forced to? Perhaps you shouldn't want to save some people in an all-mortal universe who can only die. And what about if God just wants to be cruel, and he decides to do things without telling you he's doing them? He could torture you indefinitely for no good reason. Or he could just kill you if you say something he finds objectionable and he wants to. If it's such a great opportunity for him, you'd think he'd be sure to warn you first.</p><br><p>Or, to take the whole world that God made into a metaphor for the whole universe, we have these different worlds, and God is in charge of them all, but some of them are real and God is "preserving" them, but others are evil and God is "maintending" them. What if one or two of those evil or indifferent gods are real? God "maintaining," in this sense, is not a benevolent act; it's just being cold and cruel. So why wouldn't God just leave things to his subordinates, if he doesn't care about the people in them.</p><br><p>This is a common criticism of Pascal's wager. And it has a certain logic to it. But does that logic apply to God as a being with infinite power to create anything? If that kind of God is possible, that is to say his omnipotence is real, then shouldn't it <em>change what God's decision is</em> about whether to create something that is just like Himself or not? Isn't it _possible _that God thinks He's God and I'm really him in some sense, even if he isn't me? Surely all that would change that God's decision, which is just being an omnipotent being and doing what he likes? I don't know why I would want to take Pascal's wager on my own, either, given that it doesn't answer my questions. Unless I thought it would make a difference, of course.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
