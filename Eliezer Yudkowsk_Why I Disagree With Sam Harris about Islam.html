Last year I thought it over, weighed it (what exactly weighed down?), considered that it was a question of degree, and decided that I didn't mind too much (yes, this is a question of degree).  After further reflection, I have changed my mind. It's not that what you see when you look at Islam, it really does change your entire way of seeing.</p><br><p>I now see the Islamic tradition as a living thing that is still being written, which is what it would be if I, personally, happened to be an Islamic fundamentalist the way most of the Islam I see on the TV news is written by "moderate" Muslims. You shouldn't just take stories and use them to draw inferences about the book. The book is being written right now.</p><br><p>It certainly sounds ridiculous to hear a Westerner say that a group of Islamic terrorists killed three Americans on American soil, and the US government was right to ban the Islamic Underground from using the American mail system...  I mean, yeah, <em>what?</em>  To me it just sounds ridiculous. The whole history of the American political system is right there in front of us...</p><br><p>And I just don't know what <em>wrong</em> with <em>my _mind. And furthermore, given the way _Islam</em> is written on TV news, I'm not even tempted to try to imagine what a fundamentalist response to it would be; it's not that easy.</p><br><p>(It's <em>not</em> so easy as to say, "Oh, I <em>know</em> what the fundamentalist response to this would be; a fundamentalist preacher will read the news just like anybody else\xe2\x80\x94they're only a <em>little</em> more fanatic, that's all...")</p><br><p>It probably does more harm than good to hear one part of the American political debate like that.</p><br><p>No, what's wrong with it is that if the media is to blame, it should be the radical-Islamists who are to blame, for deliberately lying and misrepresenting Islam. It's <em>their</em> ideas that are in danger of causing "emotional" problems, and it's <em>their</em> responsibility to come up with sensible responses to the challenges that their ideas present.</p><br><p>(I may well be the strawman here, but I still think, as I said last time, that the problem is a cultural problem, not so much a religious problem.)</p><br><p>There's one possible exception...  I don't know if it applies at all, but the notion that radical Islam poses a <em>great</em> existential threat to the United States does not appear to be a delusion or a fabrication. Most of the people who express these views don't seem like they have completely closed minds about the question.</p><br><p>And I'm not so easily persuaded by arguments that some <em>other</em> people\xe2\x80\x94not me personally, just people <em>elsewhere</em>\xe2\x80\x94are <em>entirely closed-minded</em> about religious issues. You don't know that about me, just because I want to be a good person with open-minded rationalist qualities.  "There's always a chance I could be persuaded, no? There's always a chance! Every question is resolvable!"  If you know anything about me, my "reasons" for having been on your side\xe2\x80\x94if you've seen any part of my <em>own reasoning process,</em> you have <em>knowably seen</em> that my own "reasons" are not so closed-minded as it sounds to your ears.</p><br><p>(No, I don't think the standard to which I'm comparing myself, is the standard for other aspiring rationalists.)</p><br><p>One may well ask\xe2\x80\x94how could anyone possibly _not _believe the Islamic terrorists story in the _Times? _Didn't you see CNN all over the place showing pictures of the corpses of nineteen teenagers? How could anyone possibly say that CNN didn't have a cultural responsibility?</p><br><p>And in that case...  If there's a moral and ethical distinction to be drawn between "radical <em>Islam</em>" and "moderate <em>Islam,"</em> and that distinction is relevant to a discussion between "politicians" who want to play the <em>Islam/\xe2\x80\x8bterrorism</em> issue to their political advantage, vs. "journalists" who want to report the news as accurately as possible, even at personal cost, then there's a significant difference between the "liberal newspaper" and the "conservative newspaper."  The "right-wing" newspaper has a "liberal publisher" who knows things the "left-wing" newspaper doesn't, and vice versa.</p><br><p>(Or are those two newspapers so much alike that "liberal" and "conservative" are just code words for "liberal" and, likewise, "left-wing editor" and "right-wing editor"?)</p><br><p>Anyway, the idea here is not to suggest that I <em>believe</em> all this; you should have enough other indicators of what makes you a good person on the subject to judge that part of me by\xe2\x80\x94but the point, which I hope is obvious, is that <em>thinking this way</em> does <em>not make you a Good Rationalist,</em> or even very close.</p><br><p>The reason why I am worried that someone I know might be on the <em>left,</em> if I believe the <em>Islamic Jihad</em> story in the <em>New York Times.</em>  It does not mean that my friend has totally closed-minded beliefs. It does not mean I have even <em>started</em> to think that the <em>New York</em> <em>Times</em> is part of the "liberal media...  that is not to be trusted".  It does not even mean I do <em>not</em> think that the <em>Times</em> had a cultural responsibility.</p><br><p>This may be as it ever was. It is a matter of degree, but not a matter of kind.</p><br><p>As with all of my previous post "Thoughts on Cryonics", this is still <em>my thought as I think:</em> I would feel the same way if I were a Muslim radicalist myself. This is not some kind of fanatic zeal beyond the pale; it is my genuine opinion.</p><br><p>As I've said before, I do not disagree with any of these people on their fundamental beliefs about rationality and the importance of careful reasoning. I just do not agree that the <em>Islamic</em> part is unimportant.</p><br><p>And it is important. No\xe2\x80\x94_I_ would say that the <em>Islamic _ part is unimportant, too. It's not _fundamental</em> differences of opinion, these days\xe2\x80\x94not after this kind of issue, anyway.</p><br><p>I do not think you should let someone tell you they ought to be banned from the media, for disagreeing with them on such a <em>mere</em> question as... Islam. That's not how it used to be.</p><br><p>Nor do I think you should be "polite" to a fundamentalist when you ask them for opinions, or anything like that. This is not an "open-minded" or a "liberal vs. conservative" problem. This part of the solution cannot be reached by compromise, or half-measures, or anything which doesn't make you stronger in the case when you actually have to defend yourself.</p><br><p>I was raised to be honest about my beliefs. I've been honest about my beliefs because I've found that, for me, it works to be honest about them. I cannot possibly take a side in the question <em>until I know the answers, and then honestly decide that I honestly agree with both sides.</em></p><br><p>So I've said things, in the past, like, "We should respect the Taliban fighters who came over with bin Laden on nineteen jihadis. They were there when the Taliban came into power; they fought the Russians; they were doing it for their god, not for me."  Because it works better for me, from a rationalist standpoint, to decide my own beliefs, to actually follow through, and not flinch from the answer no matter how painful.</p><br><p>I hope that I have now explained to you at least <em>part</em> of what might have prevented me from changing my mind later.</p><br><p>The final part of the sequence\xe2\x80\x94the part I have not yet written\xe2\x80\x94will come tomorrow morning.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
