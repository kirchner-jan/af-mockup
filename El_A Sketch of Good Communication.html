</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is it?</li>
</ul><br><p>This is the first in a new sequence that was suggested by a friend.</p><br><p>Note: This sequence contains, some of, the core skills of communication. A couple of them come up again, but this time differently, and that's fine, for now, you can work on just one thing at a time: listening and communicating.</p><br><p>At the end, I have a "what's going on" section and some good conversations to be having.</p><br><p>How to listen:</p><br><p>First, a couple of bits of terminology. Listeners and listeners. We use listeners in two very different ways. We are a <em>listener</em> (and a <em>listener listener</em>) when we make some effort to listen to, and understand the other person's message. In order to do this we need to know what to listen for.</p><br><p>An <strong>empathizer</strong> is someone who can see things the way they are, in the way the other person is seeing them. Not all people who are sad are sad because they were sad, but because when they were sad you could see that they were sad. When that happens, they can often take some steps to fix themselves, or fix what made them sad. When you listen empathically, you put your emotional state aside and get to the core of what the other person is saying to you. (I often wish I was a much better empathy)</p><br><p>A listener-listener can be an empatizer or otherwise.</p><br><p>An <strong>interpret</strong> is to a listener, what a listener is to an empatizer. They listen with open, curious ears in order to understand what "you" are saying. This is what interpret is and an interpret is also a listener. The difference being that an interpret listens for what you are trying to convey, or what you are trying not to convey. They are also a listener in the real sense of the word. They look for what you are saying.</p><br><p>There are various people with different skill levels at interpret and listener.</p><br><p>The other part of listening is <em>un-listening</em>. Some people say they are not good listeners but good listeners. That's probably either the same person trying to be both or they aren't being honest. There is a big difference between the two of them: You can listen to an audiobook or a book while un-listening to the words. When you say to yourself, "I didn't quite understand the thing" or "I don't know what you mean by that" that's an un-listener. It shows you're listening.</p><br><p>One thing that is important to understand about listening and communication is that different humans have different priorities.</p><br><p>There are good reasons for a conversation. If you have an understanding of that, but you are trying to learn the skills of better listening and better communication, it might not be worth it to you to be a good listener. You might get a lot more information from a bad listener. To the bad listener, good listening is effort and time and effort is unnecessary. It might even be annoying to try to figure out why you are being un-listened to and what it is you really care about.</p><br><p>I will use the word <em>sketch</em> to describe the first conversation we will be walking through in the next couple posts. The basic structure of a good communication sketch is something like:</p><br><p>You have problems and feelings that you want to be able to fix. You might be an empatiser or a listener, you might have a different priority.</p><br><p>You try to get out this information into words, but they are in an off-topic tangent.</p><br><p>You point at it so that the other person can see what it's about and you see if they can help with the problem, and maybe it will help.</p><br><p>You think about it for a few minutes.</p><br><p>With that as background, why a sketch? I say sketch because there was a sketch for what we could talk about.</p><br><p>We talked about it a bit, we both got a better idea of what each other wanted to happen, we came to trust each other more, we had an idea what part of the conversation would and would not be productive for us.</p><br><p>That's a good sketch. If you have the basic skills of empatizing, listening and understanding, you can draw better conversations. If you can't and are trying, this sketch might help.</p><br><p>How to have the conversation</p><br><p>In this sketch a lot of the conversational activity is being done by the interpreter. This is pretty hard to see. I have a simple diagram to represent it.</p><br><p><strong>Empatizing</strong> and <strong>listening</strong> are both done from within the interpreter's head. The interpreter decides what to ask and how to have this conversation.</p><br><p><strong>Exploring __and __feeling</strong> can either be asked of the empatizer or decided by the interpreter.</p><br><p><strong>Exploits</strong> and <strong>thinking</strong> are both what the empatizer wants from the interpreter, they may not be being asked for it. Sometimes the interpreter can and will think of them themselves though.</p><br><p><strong>Learning</strong> and <strong>reflective work</strong> are both the interpreter trying to figure out how to best interact with this kind of conversation. The empatizer does not always have any insight. Sometimes the interpreter and empatizer are working together and asking each other questions, sometimes they are solving a problem in their minds instead.</p><br><p>That's the high-level view of the conversation process. The process can be any amount of complicated and detailed, or simple and linear, or any combination of the two.</p><br><p>There's so much information in the diagram that I can't express it all here. For one of the purposes of the sketch was to help you draw the correct one. This sketch is a <em>sketch of good communication</em>, not the real thing. You don't have to do every single thing I say. I made up numbers for the diagram, these are just some of my guesses for how the conversation would play out.  (I don't need to use every single figure, I made some up, I could have made anything up, and that is fine.)</p><br><p>When I was making the diagram, I felt like this was the first communication I should draw and was the first communication they would draw in. I was wrong for a few reasons:</p><br><ol>
<li>This is a skill that builds with practice. It starts with having had a few conversations where you try to communicate and it ends in a mess, which is where most people start. For some people it's not much of a problem. They just try to be kind to the other person. For some people, it makes it hard to even know where to begin.</li>
</ol><br><p>The first thing to do is work to have some conversations that are OK but it is clear that both sides are trying to have this conversation rather than both trying to have a conversation with a bad listener. You don't need to try to be a good speaker, just know how to have a conversation.</p><br><ol>
<li>This is very very basic, it's like starting from the ground up in drawing. In drawing you can draw lots of pictures which are totally crazy and have no meaning at all. This is kind of the same thing, you can draw very very bad and pointless sounding conversations in an attempt to work them out, which can be totally ineffective, or in the other direction, you can work with a bad conversation to figure out how it can be changed into something much better with a little bit of work. This is where working with bad communication is especially important because often bad communication is a habit, and often times we have to work with a habit.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>It's just easier to work with conversations you have had many times before and where both people are listening rather than trying to start one with another person in the conversation. This is fine if you want to learn the skill, but for that, I would recommend working with someone who already has the skill (unless they are a bad listener) before doing it in isolation (with new people, or with people who only know the basics of the skill) and then having someone to work with for practicing the whole thing.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>For some people when they draw conversations they can easily see the point that the two parties are trying to have and maybe get frustrated if they keep on going down a path which doesn't make any sense. They can get confused if they aren't sure which path the other person is on. This is the same kind of thing you are working with in conversations. I have seen this happen with some people, and I haven't always worked with them on it myself.</li>
</ol><br><p>There are other problems with this model too, I don't think I have time to go into them all in this sketch, or in this particular conversation. I think that drawing the right sketch of a conversation to have will involve learning to take into account the needs of a person who is a bad listener.</p><br><p>What is it?</p><br><p>The conversation is the first part of communicating, but what is it about?</p><br><p>One kind of communication happens when you are already friends, you know what is going on in a person's head and how they are feeling and maybe you have some idea of how you could make them feel better so that you don't have to tell them, because you can already see they have the same problem you do (usually one which is not hard to solve if you can figure it out).</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
