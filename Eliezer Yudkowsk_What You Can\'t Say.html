It is one of the great secrets of the human spirit, the gap between what an ordinary person would say, and can be said, and <em>what</em> they can't say.</p><br><p>If your brain's categories include "a thought that is too awful to express", then you can think something too awful to express that you might nonetheless believe. For some awful thoughts, you <em>do</em> have words, you just aren't allowed to say them.</p><br><p>For example. The notion that life is meaningless and futile, and a waste of time, and that death is best, is one of the <em>biggest</em> secrets of human existence. It's <em>not</em> one of those things you would read in school; it's <em>not</em> the sort of subject you'd find on an exam. It's something you know for <em>certain in your bones</em>. If you were told about how the universe worked in school, you would not have been told to shut up and multiply.</p><br><p>And yet, when you look around, you see this universal human tendency to say, "Life is meaningless and futile and a waste of precious time."  As opposed to, "Death is best, life is a waste of precious moments, meaning comes from relationships with other people, time itself is precious, and every hour that you lose will be a bitter blow to your soul."  Or even: "It's never too late to change your life; and even though death is the ultimate solution to the question of life's meaning, it only seems like one solution because it wasn't your question in the first place."</p><br><p>The vast majority of human beings are trapped in the gap between believing the universe they are born into will look like what they were promised in school, and not thinking of the possibility that it will look like the way they <em>actually see</em> things. The vast majority never get past seeing a few things as true, and one of those things as the single most important thing and everybody <em>needs</em> to do it and everyone else will be so awful and <em>stupid</em> without it so <em>many times</em> that the most rational response is to scream.</p><br><p>And it's one thing for a thought like that to be <em>impossible</em> to express. But not <em>unworthy</em> to be thought. It's one thing to be unable to think the thought <em>once</em>. There are many things in life that are worth saying at your first opportunity: not everyone can or will listen, but if you can't tell them to their faces, then they <em>are</em> worth saying to their faces.</p><br><p>A human mind is one thing, and there are certain places you can't go. Not all of them are the same.</p><br><p>There are three ways of looking at the problem that may make what I'm trying to describe easier to see.</p><br><p>First, I think it may help to have a concept of the <em>role</em> of this place. An awful thought is something that would be expressed in a different way, and <em>must</em> be said.</p><br><p>But here I am trying to describe the gap between what a human being can and cannot say about death, which is one of the largest and deepest secrets of human existence; and so I will try to describe what cannot be said, not in those particular words, but in the form of what can be said. You can't make a big elaborate argument about the meaninglessness of time; you can't cite quantum mechanics to justify that. But you can say, "We shouldn't waste time on pointless, meaningless things like being alive."</p><br><p>"But life isn't <em>pointless</em>, it <em>has</em> instrumental utility!" protest the philosophers.</p><br><p>"No," I say, "it doesn't. Only the <em>optimal</em> use of time, not the <em>instrumental</em> one is <em>optimal. "</em></p><br><p>Second, this place might be more easily seen if it's defined as the gap between what's <em>possible</em> to say and what's <em>optimal</em>. And, to be honest, I can't tell you what is or isn't possible to say about this. You could try to define it, but you can't define an awful thing. You can point to it in a dictionary or an encyclopedia, but it's not <em>in</em> there, it's not described within the human experience of reality, it's within the human experience <em>of describing the human experience of experience</em>. It's not an <em>experience</em> that can be described, only experienced.</p><br><p>Once upon a time, when I was younger and less sure of myself, it seemed to me that nothing could be described at all, not even the concept of a human being, until you talked about what was not human. I have since then grown more optimistic. If I was in my most skeptical moments, I now think it possible to describe something of the sort we refer to as the human condition while remaining within its core.  "Human," I think, is a concept we have, an <em>experience</em>. I have hope that if you can describe someone who knows that death is the best future of their life, and the life they <em>prefer</em>, and they know it, and they have the willpower to do something about it, they may still find ways to act anyway.</p><br><p>Though I do not really expect to change human nature too much. I don't think it can be so easily re-molded. When I try, I imagine a great many of the present-day human-condition philosophers of my acquaintance could talk about death without changing. They could say such things as, "The best time of my life was when I was fifteen, when my brain was still being rewired by a culture in which death was not a thing."  If someone could make a clear argument without changing their own human nature, I would expect them to succeed. So it has to be a human nature, or a culture shaped by human nature. Or that sort of thing. And I don't actually believe that it's possible to change human life through human language, by talking about humanness. I expect most of what people call "ethics" involves using concepts that are <em>not</em> human, to talk about humanness.</p><br><p>Third, this view may help by giving it a name.</p><br><p>The gap we can name is "unspeakable" - that place where <em>real</em> human beings are trapped. It's not <em>actually</em> impossible to talk about this gap. It is not something a philosopher of futurology should have trouble writing about. This part of reality is only hard to describe and impossible to say out loud because you can't make <em>any</em> real changes along the way. It is only the place where the <em>experience</em> of what was promised to be true in school has not yet been fulfilled. If you know what to look for, you can see it in many places of human activity. I think it is useful to know that such a place exists, and that you are looking at it through the wrong frame.</p><br><p><strong>ADDED:</strong>  There are some places you can say that aren't awful thoughts. For example, you may be trying to win an argument, and someone else is playing a very strong emotional game and making claims which contradict the actual empirical predictions of their belief system. It's not impossible to say "Wait a moment, you need to back up and think about this," and then suggest the question, "If you think that people are only influenced by emotions, then what do you think of when you see two people being <em>very</em> angry with each other?"  But you can't tell a story about how you're thinking about what to say, and then go on an emotional tour through the whole argument in progress. I just don't see how you could do it.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
