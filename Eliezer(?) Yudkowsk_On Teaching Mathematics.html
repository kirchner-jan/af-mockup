Numbers, it turns out, are really interesting objects. I could do things to them\xe2\x80\x94for example, subtracting them from one another\xe2\x80\x94and get interesting and new answers. If you have an eleven-year-old boy in your life and know him well, try this as a way to help him learn the value of real numbers.</p><br><p>I had a very bad time with the actual subject matter in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. I had a feeling that I wanted a math book more like <em>How to Count</em>. I wanted someone to talk to, to listen, and to hold my hand where it should go to solve a problem, even though I wasn't smart enough to make the steps up by myself.</p><br><p>In high school I was one of those children one could help around the room. I could remember how to calculate the area of a pie, and could translate that into _How to Count. _But the subject was completely new to me. I learned to work a few problems in my head, like the square, the square root, and the cube root, and discovered that I could figure out many other things.</p><br><p>Of course, I didn't know then that I should learn to do real math, not the toy problems in my head.</p><br><p>Later I discovered how to build a real machine. And as I learned to build things, I started thinking about why things worked, how to design better gears with different shapes and how to find good suppliers of things, and discovered how to use math to reason about gears and bearings and stuff and so went on to learn <em>Real Analysis</em>.</p><br><p>And that was one way of learning to count, and the math that would later drive my research into Artificial Intelligence.</p><br><p>I'm not saying this was the <em>only</em> factor in how I managed to go from mathematics major to research fellow, from mathematics major to technical staff at the Singularity Institute. I was also in the right place at the right time.</p><br><p>But it was an important factor, and part of how I got that far was coming up with new ideas myself and letting them work out. The real key, the thing that made me the next Yudkowsky, the key that separates me from Less Wrong, is the ability to learn math where I can learn it by thinking myself, and not having to learn any math in my head. Not, "When I'm ten my math teacher showed me how to calculate the volume of a cone" but, "When I was ten I wondered why a cone was a curved shape, and I tried to calculate the volume it would take, and...well, I figured the math out."  This is the thing that separates me from a thousand maths majors in the same place and in the same time frame. This is the way I went to the Bay, from the Bay Area to MIRI, and then ultimately from MIRI to the Singularity Institute itself.</p><br><p>But once I understood how to learn math the way I did, the way I teach it, it only took a short time\xe2\x80\x94three years, or so\xe2\x80\x94to understand the math in <em>Proofs and Completeness</em>, one of the major books in the Singularity and Artificial Intelligence research areas. Proofs and completeness is a set of ideas in mathematical logic that I'd been interested in from the time I was a student. Once I had enough math background to read and follow, and to understand the ideas from a first-year college math major's level\xe2\x80\x94and when I read the book, it seemed <em>simple</em> compared to some of the other math on the technical FAQ for Friendly AI\xe2\x80\x94I found that the ideas in this book gave me a very broad perspective on the subject of mathematical logic and mathematical theory. With this book, I started thinking of what kind of problems might require different ideas in a theory, and when I had some new insight into a math problem I might need to know, I started researching.</p><br><p>At this point I was only thirteen, but even then, I found out how to read papers in math, and get up to speed on a field without having to learn every step in my head. It was an <em>important</em> fact, which meant I could move straight to a higher subject without waiting until I was in my first year of college, even though what I was working on at the time would be in any case difficult for an undergraduate.</p><br><p>I still don't remember what it's like learning for an undergraduate. Not that I know it, because by then I'd already lived a year in an adequate world. But I was told that learning math by sitting in a classroom, staring at a blackboard in an office while talking about math, is <em>not</em> an adequate substitute for learning math. You'll be able to do real math because you know the rules for what you're doing and you know where you're putting your hand and why. Reading a textbook, writing down the steps, and thinking about the problem can get you into an adequate world if you know how to go beyond it when you need to.</p><br><p>This is why I'm trying to write about it. An <em>interesting _topic here on Less Wrong is the difference between math and probability and statistics and decision theory. And the problem of being good at math is _interesting only</em> because it helps you deal with your problems directly\xe2\x80\x94not because I think it's important for a rationalist to get good at math and then apply it to problems that you encounter in the real world.</p><br><p><strong>Is this the reason why Eliezer Yudkowsky wants Less Wrong to stop talking about math?</strong></p><br><p>No. I want to talk about all the parts of the world that don't come up here on Less Wrong\xe2\x80\x94politics, religion, art, philosophy, economics, law, religion even.</p><br><p>And I want to talk, above all, about rationality of a different kind than the kind of rationality that Less Wrong discusses. For example, Less Wrong says it focuses on <em>epistemic</em> rationality\xe2\x80\x94the part of rationality that goes into figuring out what's true; on how to do this properly; on how to know when you've figured them out; and so on. And I think this is a good idea too\xe2\x80\x94not because I expect there to be an <em>obvious</em> correct answer to <em>that</em> question, but because the answer may depend on complex reasoning of the sort that makes Less Wrong interesting. And as soon as we start saying, "Well, since <em>X</em> is not an issue on Less Wrong, we won't talk about <em>X</em>," this shuts down the most fun discussions people have on Less Wrong! (To give a specific example that actually took place on Less Wrong, look at this post! In real life, in the outside world, this issue is an issue!)</p><br><p>And if this is what the author intended, so be it. But I've learned something in doing the research for this paper, and talking to people about their problems, that I didn't know <em>from reading the book:</em>  I want to know how to teach someone all the parts of math not yet on Less Wrong. I want to know from the top of my head what I think they will need to learn so as not to be left behind by all the smart people around them who are learning math as fast as they can.</p><br><p>What I discovered is that the main reason an eleven-year old isn't learning real math is not that the subject is too abstract but that many people are scared by the subject. They're afraid of learning the <em>syntax</em> and <em>not so afraid</em> of the <em>semantics</em>. The fear of being left behind is much stronger than fear of being wrong.</p><br><p>So, as a project to write a rationality-related book, I'm going to try to start by talking about how you're going to be taught a <em>very</em> basic level of real math when you're born. Until you're six, you're taught the "natural numbers" and (as we call them) the <em>whole</em> integers:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...</p>
</blockquote><br><p>What do these integers <em>mean</em>?</p><br><p>First of all:  They mean <em>something</em>, and the thing they mean, or at least the way we <em>talk</em> about them, may be enough to build up a working knowledge of mathematics.</p><br><p>This means you might be able to follow along through this book, without being able to answer every question\xe2\x80\x94or ask any questions at all! But I hope the basic ideas can be enough for someone to get at least a <em>first</em> working knowledge of the syntax and the semiotics of mathematics.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
