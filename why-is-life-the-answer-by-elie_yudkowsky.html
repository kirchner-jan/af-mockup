A standard philosophical puzzle is that the universe sure looks simple.</p><br><p>A universe <em>created by a single god</em> seems so simple. Just sit back, watch the universe spin and spin and spin as it does the things you want it to do. Just sit back and do nothing.</p><br><p>But the truth is that every second, you are having to make a decision—to pull one lever, press another, to open a door, to raise a finger over a screen.</p><br><p>Every day you are making decisions at the speed of millions of neurons <em>and at the speed of human intuition</em>. That's a whole lot harder than just sitting and thinking—it takes a whole lot more thought. Every decision takes a whole lot of work. It feels like <em>work</em>.</p><br><p>But in the whole, this <em>does not</em> seem like it will take a superintelligence to create the <em>universe</em>. All you have to do is sit back and do <em>nothing</em>, while being more effective at steering the universe (and yourself) than yourself (and yourself).</p><br><p>Does that even seem like a meaningful distinction, that "what you are doing" has been singled out by "you (and yourself)" as special, worthy of the word "work"?  Does it look meaningful that if you ask someone "How much work is it to <em>be</em> you?" the reply will be the whole duration of your whole life?</p><br><p>And the question in "Why is Life The Answer?"—is it as simple as "What if the universe is running on something similar to decision theory? What if decisions are really how the universe works?"—is more to the point and more interesting, when you strip away all those little epicycles and epiphenomena.</p><br><p>But one of the key steps is <em>actually</em> doing the thought experiment. It's not just a philosophical puzzle, but a factual question.</p><br><p>So I'd like to pose the question to Robin Hanson:</p><br><p>Can you answer <em>why</em> life is so improbable (and such a <em>surprising</em> answer in light of physics)?</p><br><p>II.
Robin Hanson in "Why is life the answer rather than e.g. a rock?":</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"Life" seems like a specific form of physical phenomenon that is not the least bit common in random physical universes.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I also think this question can be answered with a great deal of confidence, and I think we might even have strong reasons to think that most of the Universe is just like that.</p><br><p>We might then be able to predict that life will be in places where it is "expensive", and will make a lot of sense in places like cold molecular clouds or the intergalactic dust lanes where you have a billion galaxies per cluster and lots of stars. </p><br><p>I personally don't consider this a fully complete answer, because a small subset of possible universes might have just "enough" life that life might be the <em>default</em>, which still leaves the question of why any life-world would have <em>this particular set</em> of laws. Still, it is a start.</p><br><p>It does seem like an <em>immediately</em> obvious answer to these questions. For comparison, here are some of the most striking answers to the "why is the universe?" problem I could come up with (with varying levels of relevance):</p><br><p>1) <strong>The fine-tuning argument with God</strong>:  When you think of a billion different possible universes of sufficiently high symmetry, <em>one</em> of those should really care about what you do and want to be like you. But it's hard to find a universe of low enough symmetry that cares that it creates you, but <em>actually</em> likes what you would do (if given the opportunity), and that cares only about the universe you are in.</p><br><p>2) <strong>MIRI</strong>:  A universe can either have intelligent life, or it can't. But when intelligence is the natural consequence of the laws, and no special additional conditions are needed to prevent the laws from turning everything into paperclips, then intelligence is the <em>default</em>. The surprisingness is that <em>this universe</em> is the universe <em>with intelligence</em>. You wouldn't have expected <em>that</em> to happen; but intelligence is a <em>very special</em> type of physical phenomenon.</p><br><p>3) Robin's answer as quoted above:  If life is a special form of physical phenomenon, why would it be so <em>expensive</em>? Well, at least in this universe—you can't tell <em>a priori</em>, but in fact <em>this</em> universe is that improbable. And in such improbable universes, "work" that is more efficient in generating intelligence might make sense.</p><br><p>I would add a fourth answer that combines a bit of these. We wouldn't have expected to find the laws that we find without a universe—it was extremely probable that you had a universe. But finding a universe that cared about intelligence wasn't very probable; it was exceedingly unlikely as a special form of the laws that you got.</p><br><p>Yet it happened. A universe where life existed—a universe that was <em>expensive</em>. Now there might not be a universe that is cheap <em>in general</em>—universes don't have a free lunch. You would expect such an inefficient process to get penalized. But in the set of universes that does create you, a universe where life is cheap would also be very improbable. A universe that only cares about the universe you're in, and doesn't particularly care that it's in the universe <em>or</em> that it has life.</p><br><p>Or in other words—we shouldn't be surprised to find ourselves in an expensive universe, but we shouldn't expect to find a universe particularly <em>susceptible to life</em>.</p><br><p>So I think we have an explanation of why life is so expensive.</p><br><p><em>But what else can we say? And what do we take away from it?</em></p><br><p>The obvious next question is:  <strong>What are the implications?</strong></p><br><p>But that's a tough question. It's tempting to say "Well, the main implication is that life only exists in one universe or a very specific subset of universes; which rules out a vast number of possibilities. Life only lives in places where there is a lot of matter and light. The very universe which we find ourselves in now can be discounted <em>a priori</em>. And therefore a vast number of possible <em>other</em> universes cannot contain life. This is called the Great Filter. It implies that other civilizations will not meet their potential."</p><br><p>But this is wrong, because you wouldn't necessarily expect to find <em>every possible</em> universe with life. You just wouldn't be <em>surprised</em> to find it.</p><br><p>Now, granted, the existence of life is <em>extremely improbable</em> in the laws that we see, and you can't be absolutely certain. Probability has to start somewhere.</p><br><p>But is it really <em>zero</em>? Is there some reason to think we're going to find no possible universes that would have life?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
