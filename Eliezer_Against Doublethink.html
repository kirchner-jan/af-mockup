It doesn't matter how good you feel about yourself: if you can't change your emotions, neither can your emotions change your perceptions. If your map has errors in it, you don't get to ignore those errors, you may not even notice them.</p><br><p>For example, suppose you really enjoy your current relationship. You think of yourself as strong, kind, and thoughtful, and you really like this person enough to continue living with them. <em>Now</em> let's suppose that you're visiting your other half of brain, and your other half of self is visiting the other side of the same coin. It might be that your true self is strongly in favor of continuing in the relationship, while your brain's representation thinks that it's time to try something different out. A part of your brain isn't quite right, in that it hasn't been properly instructed, and the instructions that it receives may not be entirely accurate.</p><br><p>Or you might have visited the other side of <em>yourself</em> and not <em>your friend</em>\xe2\x80\x94so that the two of you can come to some agreement, and move forward hand in hand. And if your brain has some sort of belief that may have some unfortunate consequences for you "out there"\xe2\x80\x94for instance that your ex is going to get jealous and decide it's your fault for messing up the relationship\xe2\x80\x94then a small number of parts of yourself don't see the whole system.</p><br><p>Or let's say that you're currently in a relationship that's not quite working out. You just realized that something is wrong in it, possibly because your relationship "representative" has not yet been given any sort of instructions to "fix" your failure mode. You know at least one of the "pieces in yourself" that think that the relationship is wrong, and maybe there's even a bit of "knowledge" in you that the whole thing is going to end up being <em>sad</em>.  (It can be very hard to translate "sad" into precise English, which is why "knowing that I'm going to be sad" may not feel like a "knowing" unless you have a strong internal monologue at the time.)</p><br><p>Or suppose that when you get to visit some other part of yourself\xe2\x80\x94maybe one of those that would be responsible if your ex was going to be jealous\xe2\x80\x94it decides that you're not allowed to get out a paper "I'm a Good Person" and <em>only</em> say "I'm a GOOD person\xe2\x80\x94I know I have a bad side" when there's actually a more accurate representation of yourself somewhere inside the system. You might even take the fact that there's an emotional "bad" side to your relationship as <em>evidence against</em> the idea that a "good person" can have a "bad" side\xe2\x80\x94there must be more to "good" than a single emotional feeling at a time, or how could you be a "good" person?  (This feeling of self-doubt, or an inability to trust yourself, or an "I'm doing this too, I'm just as bad as the other one, why can't I be good too?"\xe2\x80\x94these are exactly the kinds of feelings I mean when I say "noticing confusion".  If you're not familiar with some literature about it, you may want to look it up before reading any further.)</p><br><p>This kind of thinking will <em>appear</em> to you to be about logic, and it <em>does</em> involve a kind of logic. But remember that if even one part of yourself has a piece of knowledge that may be true <em>or false</em>\xe2\x80\x94say, the part of you that says "You're just as bad as your ex", in this case\xe2\x80\x94then that knowledge may be suppressed. It may not actually <em>be</em> a fact (which would be false, in the sense that the brain has representations for) and the part of you may continue to treat it as if it were.</p><br><p>What goes wrong in this process? For that matter, why do <em>humans</em> fall into it?</p><br><p>The first point is that humans are a very weak and fallible system. Our emotional response to pain (the "I'm injured!" alarm going off) is not something that our conscious minds can <em>reason about</em> and <em>evaluate</em> as if it were part of some <em>external</em> universe. Our emotional responses are part of us, in the same sense that the rest of our bodies and our brains and our visual systems are all part of us. But we do not "know" it the same way we know ourselves being conscious. This in turn implies a "difficulty of introspective access"\xe2\x80\x94that we may only occasionally get to observe what is going on in our own consciousness\xe2\x80\x94from which our "self-model" can sometimes be very far from our "actual self".</p><br><p>As for why we fall into doublethink. I haven't yet answered the question of why a conscious machine should "fall into" doublethink. Let us just assume that we <em>are</em> conscious machines then, for the moment, and try answering the question what might go wrong when a self-model does not converge on being true and thus does not converge on all its parts knowing it to be true (if only subconsciously).</p><br><p>Suppose that part of you is looking at a problem, and you know that if an "impossible" solution turns out to be <em>possible,</em> this is strong evidence that your self-model thinks that solution a) must be impossible, but b) the part of your model that generated the solution must secretly be thinking "maybe it's possible after all" rather than "Maybe I'm just being silly".</p><br><p>Or suppose you decide to try the "impossible" thing for an hour or two, and nothing comes of it. You continue to have that piece of knowledge present in you "You tried it and it didn't work, so a solution must have been impossible."</p><br><p>Or suppose another part of yourself, the part that's writing this blog post, realizes that there's a piece of <em>you</em> that's the author of this blog post, and that piece of yourself thinks "Hey! If that <em>doesn't</em> work, it must mean it's not me talking here and it's the real you out there trying to make sense of me talking here!"</p><br><p>Or to put it more generally:  An emotional response to pain or rejection may sometimes be something that is simply <em>there</em> in a certain part of yourself (the one that's observing the emotional response), but there isn't a particular kind of reasoning that you would perform on the experience if you just let it go through your brain as a completely independent being, but there <em>might</em> be a particular kind of reason which, if you did not have that emotional response, would not cause you to discard it out of hand. And <em>maybe</em> if you are just really truly, truly <em>really</em> good at being rational, the part that is your brain will actually not dismiss it in that case, and it does make <em>some</em> difference whether or not a painful response is an emotionally real thing inside you.</p><br><p>The last example, as for why a brain might have parts of it that are not completely convinced that a given belief is true, is a particular form of what I once termed the "human drive to disbelieve".  For example, if you remember that the universe is finite, you're going to remember it better if you have the belief "The universe is always finite" than if the belief is more nuanced such as "I'm going to use my current evidence to believe that the universe is always finite".  Or let's suppose you're in a discussion with another party, and they have an emotionally charged argument with other parties about something. If one of your brain's subagents says something "That doesn't make sense!" just out of idle curiosity by itself without any sort of attempt to argue or change someone else's viewpoint; then this is the sort of thing that happens in human brains all the time.</p><br><p>This sort of thing, the fact that different parts of yourself may have separate beliefs, even if they are all "true" in the sense that it may actually be more accurate for your brain, or more of you, to believe in them all than any other possible belief, may prevent you from noticing that you and some of your friends\xe2\x80\x94or even your entire tribe\xe2\x80\x94are all just playing the same sorts of political games. And if "the universe is <em>always</em> finite", then it doesn't even seem strange to have a part of you questioning this belief\xe2\x80\x94that is, you may even feel as if there's a part of you who is <em>objectively</em> in possession of the truth in question, or that it might just be there in exactly the right place but is being suppressed by the system.</p><br><p>The part of you that looks at the universe as infinite, may not know that there is a part of it that thinks that the infinite world is "more real" than the finite world, because that thought itself might not be a part of itself that can look at itself and see that it is "more real".  In some cases an "error" in your map-within-maps can persist even if you "know" about its presence.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
