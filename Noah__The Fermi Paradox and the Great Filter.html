<li>Final Notes</li>
</ul><br><p>In the comments to my last article, I get the following objection.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>But if you argue that we are indeed likely to go extinct soon, and have already gone extinct by now, then it still takes a separate argument to argue that we should try to colonize space before that happens.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>If I believe that we are most likely to live in a universe with a Great Filter, and we have passed it already, I am much more likely to want to prevent the potential consequences of this by colonizing space.</p><br><p>My reaction is the following.</p><br><p>If we're going to do our own calculations of the likelihood of various outcomes, then we should update toward our own existence given that we see none of the following observations to date:</p><br><ul>
<li>Any space expansion efforts that have happened, or any evidence of others planned in the future.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Any evidence of a Great Filter.</li>
</ul><br><p>Now, why are we so sure that we would see neither of these observations if we indeed passed the filter?</p><br><p>In the context of existential risk, I see six relevant hypotheses:</p><br><p>Argument from Absence:</p><br><p>The absence of evidence doesn't indicate the absence of a filter between filters that allow us to see it, such as the visible universe.</p><br><p>We don't know how our visible universe, and visible matter, got here. If there were a big filter between those things and the existence and persistence of intelligent beings, then we wouldn't see either. But our own existence seems to be evidence against this hypothesis.</p><br><p>Argument for Absence:</p><br><p>If intelligent life is very rare, then many worlds are such that we do exist, but also many worlds do not exist such that it is reasonable to think that it is likely we exist in such a universe.</p><br><p>The Doomsday Argument can be applied to our existence as evidence about the Great Filter. If an intelligence filter is the most likely cause of our existence, the probability of an intelligence filter is low. In conclusion, a Great Filter between this existence evidence and the observation of the existence evidence gives rise to a posterior improbability for the existence being due to our being late in a Great Filter. A prior improbability for such an existence in such a universe would be a prior improbability that there were no aliens who would see such evidence of us.</p><br><p>This argument can be rejected if the prior probability of such a Great Filter being present doesn't make the existence evidence more or less likely in an absolute sense, and thus by no means shifts probability mass away from our being late in the Great Filter.</p><br><p>In fact, the absence of such evidence shouldn't make the existence argument more or less likely because to the best of our knowledge, intelligent life was the only place that intelligent aliens could have colonized Earth. It would be like someone saying out loud, "I like to be in the habit of having a car for transportation. And yet, so far, I have never seen anyone here on Earth drive their own car." It would be as if a scientist were to conclude that all life has evolved in the same location, and all planets that develop life must be terrestrial planets. And we don't know how Earth got here as evidence about how terrestrial planets can support life.</p><br><p>There is also an argument against an existence in the universe if you don't think that you exist. The existence of observers makes us infer from the fact the universe exists that it is likely large and possibly infinite.</p><br><p>Arguing from Extremal Value:</p><br><p>When we are considering if any possible world that we might live in has already gone extinct, we need to consider our position in the value space, e.g., the value that it has if we live in it.</p><br><p>To give a silly example, suppose that you are a very rich man who is in a car with a woman who happens to be particularly attractive and in a position where you feel that you can reasonably believe that no other man that has ever walked the Earth can feel the same way about her. Suppose this is true and all other men are jealous of you, and they cannot help but be at least a bit jealous of her in turn considering the wealth and position they both have. One day, a man approaches you. He is obviously rich and clearly not some mere mortal. This man walks very slowly so that both you and the woman are very cautious not to reveal any sign of jealousy. The man walks up to you, and slowly begins opening a conversation. After a long time into your conversation with him, he speaks up and says, "I have just flown across the oceans." By this point, he is so used to talking to her, and so well-versed in her behavior that his face does not reveal the slightest trace of how bizarre his statement is. He asks you to pass a very important note from him to her. The note says, "I am not sure exactly how to say this, but there are a number of men in the world to whom I can confidently say she is the most beautiful woman on Earth, so please treat me this one last night in my private room." It has this kind of confidence that you know how odd it is. But he explains, and you agree that the confidence is justified. It is clear that you are used to it and would not be surprised by this sort of thing. The man sits down and has a whiskey, and is visibly relaxed.</p><br><p>In this world, he is in an excellent position. He was able to take advantage of something that no mortal could ever take advantage of. He can simply make advances to any woman he desires. He can simply write this note. From his perspective, it would seem very obvious why she should accept his advances and why she should believe it is possible that other men would feel the same way.</p><br><p>You are still skeptical at this point and make some observations.</p><br><p>The distance between you and the room that the man was in is large, but he had no problem communicating with her.</p><br><p>As he was opening the conversation, he did not display a single ounce of confidence that she will find him attractive or of sufficient status to accept his advances. His tone and delivery of his statement seem to indicate that, to him, the question of whether she finds him attractive at all is entirely irrelevant. If she was the kind of woman who is attracted to the kind of man that he is, this statement does not indicate this fact to her at all. In fact, this statement indicates to her that in his mind, her status and her attractiveness have no bearing on whether she would take his advances.</p><br><p>The fact that he was confident about these things leads her to infer that he had an extraordinary amount of confidence that she would accept his advances regardless of her attraction level and status.</p><br><p>It seems in fact that if she did find him attractive, he felt there was no need for caution because of the fact that no other man in the world, and all his other friends and colleagues, would ever be jealous of him in such a situation, no matter who he was trying to seduce.</p><br><p>It seems that he had an extreme confidence in his own value that he had no interest in acting accordingly with such caution.</p><br><p>It seems there is no logical reason why he would be wrong about his feelings about her. It is just so easy to observe her behavior and think as if there are no men in the world who would have said the same thing that this man said with this level of confidence.</p><br><p>There just hasn't been much of human space expansion out there that has taken advantage of this possibility, so from your perspective, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that there hasn't been.</p><br><p>He could have easily just left at any moment if he was not confident she would accept his proposals. This would not have indicated to you that he was wrong about his feelings, it would just signify that he was not confident in his confidence in his feelings.</p><br><p>He made no attempt to prove his confidence in his own feelings by any other means than saying there is no one else in the world who can have such confidence, and his tone and facial expressions seem to indicate an attitude that such confidence is the norm and would not be considered abnormal or surprising.</p><br><p>This seems to suggest that he takes a pride in possessing these feelings, and would not sacrifice them for anything.</p><br><p>The fact is that you had no reason to think that he knew that he knows that his feelings for her are exceptional. You had no reason to believe that he would make any attempt to prove his feelings for her. The fact that he did not makes you assume that such confidence is not so unusual for him.</p><br><p>You can't even be sure he knows, since he was relaxed over his whiskey when he gave his statement. To him there is nothing to indicate that she knows what he is saying or doesn't know what he is saying.</p><br><p>Arguments from Probability</p><br><p>If there really is a Great Filter that wipes out all life very rarely in its vast multiverse, a vast number of worlds are almost identical to this one such that if we exist in such worlds, such as in the vast number of times that the Big Bang happened just as we did and such as in the numerous times that our Earth is similar to its actual position in a large planet without such a filter, we would not see such evidence of it as we will observe.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
