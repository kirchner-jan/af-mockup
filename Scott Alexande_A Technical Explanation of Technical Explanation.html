If, at any point in the process, he discovers (says the programmer) that something seems a bit odd, he will back up and redo the part.</p><br><p>In fact, if this web app has any cool new features at all, the programmer can't even be sure they're going to end up using the command line at all! At the point he wrote the command line code, he might be able to think of some cool features that are just a bit harder to implement via the web browser in that code.  "But wait," he might think, "the server won't allow me to write an sql like that!"  I just implemented that bit via the web! I don't really know how the back-end server will handle it, so maybe that bit <em>won't</em> work, and I need to rewrite it in a browser-based way, and that way the back-end will be able to handle it and everything will be fine... etc. etc. etc.</p><br><p>So. He writes a few command-line utilities. When it seems like there are parts of the app the command-line code shouldn't be calling, he back up, redo that section, and then reimplement his cool feature in a browser-compatible way.</p><br><p>This programmer is a <em>technical expert</em>. He probably gets his cool new features back on schedule. But it's going to take him <em>twice as long</em> as he might have thought beforehand.</p><br><p>A programmer may be <em>more experienced</em> than the previous programmer. And experience tells us that even the novice will <em>still</em> learn more from the expert. If the new feature involves calling a database, the novice might realize that they really do need to rewrite that section the "proper" way, even though they can't remember why the original work needed to contact the database in the first place.  "But... I used a command line interface!" the novice might say.  "How can it be proper to call that command line interface in my code, but not call the web services?"</p><br><p>A computer science professor might explain that the second thing is actually <em>not</em> a problem! The web services interface is more or less identical to the command line interface used to connect with it. The thing the professor is trying to do is set up such a way that the novice has <em>no choice</em> but to rewrite the code the first way. That way, they can't <em>just</em> think "how convenient, command line interfaces are really just APIs!"  And once they know what kind of API it is, it should be obvious that they should rewrite <em>their whole app</em> to use it.</p><br><p>But a computer science professor isn't a programmer. I have read two papers by the same person who used to teach at one of my universities, and she explained this a different way. The professor told me that this sort of thing is possible, but extremely difficult and would take a decade to master the craft, especially for novices. So that's why.1</p><br><p>Let's try another analogy. Just for fun, let's go meta.  I want to talk about how to approach academic thinking in general, and the "decontextualization" of technical explanations that happens when it's offered as a metaphor.</p><br><p><strong>I.</strong></p><br><p>Most people here know what the difference between Bayes and Frequentist reasoning is. Frequentists look for things like P(A &amp; B &amp; C) and P(A) and say "well this is a theorem, and it tells us that when we want to find the probability that A is false, we can just compute what the joint probability would be of A being false if it's false. And what's the probability of A being false given C is false?"  Bayesians don't use P(A | B or C) because that's not a theorem, and saying "well, this is an assumption, and we don't actually know that assumption, so we can't apply the theorem to it" is just giving up information. In the real world, the theorem actually works, Bayes' Theorem is actually the thing that <em>really is</em> going on, and anything else is just an approximation that's much more accurate than you'd get if you tried to do Bayesian reasoning. The word "probability" is just a convenient tool for keeping track of numbers. The problem is not in using the word "probility", it is in not understanding Bayes' Theroem, or what it <em>actually does.</em></p><br><p>So, let's return to the technical explanation of technical explanations. Here's an excerpt from one of these papers:</p><br><p>When you give a technical explanation for a technical concept, one of two things is happening. First, you are <em>decontextualizing</em> the explanation (converting it from one kind of explanation (which is basically a verbal, abstract representation) into a different kind of explanation, one that is in terms of physical systems and algorithms).</p><br><p>Second, you are <em>contextualizing</em> the concept. You are putting it into the context that the meaning exists. The question asked of you about the significance of <em>P(M|C)</em> may not be as significant as the question asked of the novice about the significance of an ordinary sentence like <em>Snow is white</em>:  "What does it <em>mean</em> to say that the probability of the sentence'snow is white' given the sentence'somthing is red' is 0?" will make more sense than "What probability should I give to the sentence 'p(M|C)"?'  This is because if P(M) is 0, then P(M|C)=0. So if someone asks you, "Given that'snow is red,' what is the probability that snow is white?"  you should actually think to yourself of all of the <em>slices</em> in P(M) that contain 0. If P(M)=0, then that slice contains a 0 in it, and the probability of a 0 is undefined. If snow is white, and there is no reason to believe it is not white, what can be the probability of snow being white?"\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2  This is the second part of the problem. Bayesian thinking does not try and answer these sorts of questions; they have been asked and answered a thousand times already by the mathematics of probability theory. Instead a Bayesian looks at the question as an attempt to find <em>P(A|B or C).</em>  The <em>way</em> one can answer this question, Bayesians think, is by looking at the meaning that the word must have in the context of its usage in the particular sentence. The first step, then, is to find the context that allows the word to have a well defined probability. The second step is to find the probability of what is written on the blackboard.</p><br><p>There is something <em>very</em> odd about this whole passage. The whole point of a technical explanation is to <em>show</em> how things work! We aren't just trying to verbalize general principles about how to think, we're trying to actually <em>convert</em> an abstract verbalization to a concrete physical system. I think technical explanations do a bad job of showing you this, though, because almost everything in this passage doesn't exist as a simple concrete physical system. The <em>meanings</em>, the <em>contexts</em>, often exist somewhere inaccessible via verbal definitions.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>I think of the "deconcontextualization" part of this as the same sort of failure that some people have when they try to explain Bayesian methods. The idea is that when you say that the meaning of P(A|B)=P(A and B)/P(B), it seems like it's saying the probability of A given B is some sort of conditional probability. But then when you ask "conditional on what?", they say "well, that's not a concept that exists in this model!" and then try to move to the non-contextualized concept of conditional probability.</p><br><p>When something fails to make intuitive sense due to being overly abstract, there's often a whole class of explanations that I call a "nontechnical explanation", or an "intended metaphor" or a "concretized metaphor".  For example, I try to avoid using the phrase "the frequency of a sample," which has weird interpretations. It's probably bad advice, because most people will be <em>intelligent and able</em> to understand "the frequency of X" as just the number, and some part of my readers will notice this. But, at the same time, if I can't explain exactly what my intended metaphor is to them, they may never grasp it.</p><br><p>Here's a nontechnical explanation of technical explanations:</p><br><p>If you give a nontechnical explanation for something that is in fact technical, what ends up happening is that each reader interprets the explanations slightly differently. To take an extreme example, when you explain Bayesian reasoning in terms of probability distributions, how would you explain things like "I see a yellow banana, and I update my prior that the next thing I see is a banana to 83%; but you, the reader, see X, and update your prior for Y to 100%" as Bayesian reasoning?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
