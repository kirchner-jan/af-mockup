<li>Conclusion: What now?</li>
</ul><br><p>Who's Had Success?</p><br><p>The main reason I am currently interested in the rationality community, is because <strong>many people say "I finally understand!  [I felt enlightened, whatever that's supposed to feel like. Or relieved.]  [I felt more like myself, more like who I really am.]  I'm now a better person than I used to be."  That's not the reason. </strong></p><br><p>It's to <em>get better at the art of thinking better.</em></p><br><p>It's the art of rationality\xe2\x80\x94the skill it is to ask questions that will actually make your model of the world be, or already <em>is</em>, better.</p><br><p>It's why I was excited about a community devoted to doing better collectively\xe2\x80\x94because that was the sort of thing that worked well for me.</p><br><p>And that's why I'm a little concerned with how most of these communities (at least in the Bay Area) end up <em>talking</em> about what they're all about\xe2\x80\x94that are <em>about something,</em> but not always about the <em>things they should be about.</em></p><br><p>When you are reading a "self-help" book, do you read it for the self-help? Or does the title catch your eye, and then you think:  "<em>Oh, what a cool topic! I wish I knew more about this</em>."  Do you read a book on happiness first, because it mentions "happiness", and so you think they might have interesting ideas about that? The usual pattern is...you read <em>whatever</em> happens to be first on the book's table of contents.</p><br><p>When I said to myself:  "<em>I'll never get better at thinking if I don't learn about rationality!</em>" I realized that I was <em>failing to notice</em> what rationality <em>was</em>\xe2\x80\x94this skill, this method\xe2\x80\x94what led me to think the obvious thing to see, and what to see instead-of there. (And, more importantly, was this a reason why I had <em>been</em> so clueless about it\xe2\x80\x94because I hadn't <em>thought to</em> notice what was in front of me, to look at the _contrast:  And then realize that the contrast suggested there might be something I was missing, that it might catch my attention...)</p><br><p>Of course, there was something I was missing. What I was missing was a <em>community-level model</em> of rationality\xe2\x80\x94something that would help me be more rational by, for example:</p><br><ul>
<li>Figuring out what my goals were;</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Actually figuring out how to achieve those goals, e.g. what habits, plans, etc.;  </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Avoiding akrasia /\xe2\x80\x8b mental flinches /\xe2\x80\x8b cached thoughts /\xe2\x80\x8b cached selves\xe2\x80\x94those tricksy little bugs in our brains that keep us from being who we could be, and from having what we want, and that get more and more powerful with every passing year of our lives.  (By "bugs" I mean <em>things</em> in our heads, not abstract "bugs" that may need to get fixed some day. So I'm not referring to the sort of "bugs" that would be more appropriate as technical concepts if we were all talking about computers\xe2\x80\x94e.g. bugs that get in the way of you seeing clearly.)</li>
</ul><br><p>And most importantly of all...</p><br><p><strong>The Good Life Experience</strong></p><br><p>If we're going to really be better off as individuals, or as a community, we'll need to figure out how to work together <em>effectively</em>.</p><br><p>Most of us will <em>never</em> have been in a high-pressure, high-reliability, high-stress job...but that's exactly when we need to be most capable of being rational. A lot of people have had the experience of being <em>so stressed out</em> that they were unable to really <em>see</em> what was going on in front of them. They found it easier to focus on the abstract "bugs" they might be working on fixing\xe2\x80\x94bugs like akrasia, cached thoughts, cached selves, and so on. (E.g. things in their heads, not bugs on their laptops.)</p><br><p>If we want to be rational, we've got to learn how to actually <em>feel</em> at least a little bit like high-pressure, low-stress individuals or teams working in high-pressure, hard-trying high-reliability environments\xe2\x80\x94especially when that's where we're supposed to be, because it's what would really make our model of the world more accurate.</p><br><p>And if this is your goal for yourself, and/\xe2\x80\x8bor for the people you want to help through rationality\xe2\x80\x94then you will have an important job to do.  (We'll talk more about that later.)</p><br><p>The Rationalist Community as a Low-Pressure Environment</p><br><p><strong>The Mission of a Rationality Community</strong></p><br><p>Let's try to put the concept of rationality into words.</p><br><p>To make it clear what we mean, I offer the following:</p><br><ul>
<li>"Rationality" includes the arts of: How to know when you're confused; How to actually change your mind in the face of real evidence; How to make complex plans that actually get done; How to evaluate competing plans; How to choose goals that are actually meaningful to you; How to evaluate whether you're happy with your life; How to become happier without much trying.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The community is meant to provide each of us with a <em>shared context</em>, that helps us see our confusion, our opportunities, and our lives; a community designed to <em>create</em> shared context. Rational-community members may or may not agree with one another on how to best achieve personal goals or on how to best improve the world, but they _are supposed to share a _sense of unity, community, goal, and identity.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The rationality community is meant to serve as an <em>influence</em> that can help one person's art of rationality influence another. E.g. by teaching and/\xe2\x80\x8bor practicing, in all the different ways of rationality. That is, it's meant to help someone with a less-advanced art of rationality to progress on to a "rational", i.e. more advanced art.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Community is supposed to be low-pressure. Rational-community-members are expected to make an extra effort to be kind to each other, and to follow the norms of the community, even when it's uncomfortable, awkward, and ungainly. Rational-community culture is meant to be conducive to <em>actually seeing</em> whatever might be going on, in order to actually <em>correctly model</em> it, or to actually <em>make</em> it stop. E.g., it's meant to make it feel safe or socially acceptable to suggest that something might be wrong with an idea, or to offer a different way of looking at the same evidence.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Rational-community-as-low-pressure-environment idea will be hard to square with some existing cultural conventions and patterns. Many of these may be hardwired into the way we all think and see and act. As an experiment in changing cultural patterns, the Rationalist community provides a framework\xe2\x80\x94a place and way of seeing things\xe2\x80\x94that can potentially be adopted by anyone with enough self-compassion and social flexibility.</li>
</ul><br><p>Why Low-Pressure?</p><br><p>Low-pressure environments might be high-risk in certain circumstances, but they have a number of benefits.</p><br><p>First of all, they are a <em>unique</em> way to be that is not the norm. Norms around "what would actually be comfortable and socially acceptable" are <em>usually wrong</em>, and are usually built around whatever one happens to be doing at the moment. To change something, you've got to break away from the default path.</p><br><p>Secondly\xe2\x80\x94once you've <em>actually</em> gotten comfortable with a particular way of thinking, and know how a particular way of seeing feels, and you already have some sort of internal framework, as well as some of the other key skills\xe2\x80\x94then you have the <em>potential</em> to <em>become</em> comfortable in a high-stress, high-reliable environment:  You can do better in a high-reliability job than in a low-reliability one, you can do better in highly-pressured jobs than in an easy-pressure job, you can be better at helping other people with rationality than by doing it the "normal" way of e.g. going to a university to study. The high-pressures, high-relsilliby parts come more naturally.</p><br><p>Thirdly and perhaps most importantly\xe2\x80\x94low-pressure environments are safer. You're <em>not likely</em> to "burn out" if you don't get your work done\xe2\x80\x94the pressure doesn't hurt you, you don't fail, your team wins. As a group, high-pressured individuals may be prone to frustration, anger, self-doubt, insecurity, and so on\xe2\x80\x94traits <em>that</em> a low-pressure environment is meant to counter by teaching, by giving members time to <em>process</em> and to think things through before sharing the results, and so on [1, 2]. In a low-pressured environment, you may face criticism, or the stress of failing, and that stress will help you <em>see</em> things better; there's not so much of a cost for failure, so less resistance against trying the thing again.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
