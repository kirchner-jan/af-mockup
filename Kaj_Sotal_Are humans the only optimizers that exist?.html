Then suddenly, out of nowhere, there appeared creatures intelligent enough to start evolving; they were able to colonize a good deal of space with no permanent obstacles between them and their distant destinations.</p><br><p>What you would expect to see, in such a situation, is that space between the creatures and their destinations would rapidly fill with life. Life will fill in as a result of its own intelligence, but there's no need to create life in order to fill in the gap. Life was already in existence, and it was only the other side of a vast space that was filled with it; and if the creatures' descendants were intelligent enough, they wouldn't need to fill in _all _the gap themselves; they could use the help of life's presence in the intervening space to do so.</p><br><p>You don't just want to see <em>us.</em> You want to see an infinite series of "you"s, all arising over time, and all with our particular motivations and mindsets\xe2\x80\x94the sort of infinite regrouping that we might expect to see if life had a tendency to aggregate.</p><br><p>We didn't do that, though. Rather, we look upon our local region of space, and we see something different\xe2\x80\x94not an infinite regrouping of minds, but an "unfolding" of time; a "forward chaining" of events to other events in the present time, rather than things appearing on their own local timescales.</p><br><p>Indeed, even _this _is something unusual. To the degree that you don't understand natural selection's effects on organisms' genes, you would expect it to behave differently\xe2\x80\x94the vast majority of life will share the same general genome with you, no matter how many of them there are. It seems likely that when _humans _evolve, they will not share the great majority of life on Earth with you.</p><br><p>This does not necessarily prove there are limits on how large you can spread, but it seems at least worth considering the possibility.</p><br><p>As a result, it does seem quite reasonable to ask if there's any reason that the great majority of intelligent life might not exist in distant space.</p><br><p>In a universe without intelligent life, why did we exist?</p><br><p>If there was a priori reason to expect our existence on Earth, on some other planet, it seems that there should also be an a priori reason for life to be rare on other planets, in order to ensure that we exist. In the infinite time limit, "we" don't exist and you couldn't expect an infinite series of yous to exist at all. A finite time-length might still look like a "great filter". We still might exist somewhere... but it would be very unlikely indeed that we would be <em>here.</em></p><br><p>Of course, most of your ancestors don't exist in the infinite past. Instead you can think of a bunch of different, mostly-separate past-you-s spreading out from the present moment in time. I think the argument goes through roughly the same whether you are thinking about our place in space or in time. We may exist somewhere in the future, but it will be atypical for the vast majority of the space and time that would constitute an "infinite" past.</p><br><p>So is this argument, then, an argument that the vast majority of intelligent life does not exist in distant galaxies?</p><br><p>Well, I don't think so. There are various reasons why such an argument might not be so convincing. For example, how would we know that such a conclusion was true?</p><br><p>But overall, I do think that this argument makes something significant that was not obvious at all: namely, that many more things exist in space than exist in time. In particular, the universe still exists, it's just that it's no longer infinite.</p><br><p>Imagine taking a really huge ball, and smacking it as hard as you can. Nothing happens; the ball is a perfectly elastic sphere that doesn't burst. But suppose you want it to explode. Do you need to make the sphere bigger? Or could you just give it a kick so hard that it's still there afterwards?</p><br><p>Well actually, neither of these methods works. The ball doesn't explode upon being hit by itself\xe2\x80\x94which might surprise you, if you thought that a kick would make one go "boom"\xe2\x80\x94and neither does simply hurling it at something else to blast it out of existence.</p><br><p>Now imagine that instead you need to <em>create the universe</em> in order to hit it with another ball, in such a way that it _automatically _explodes. Sure, it's the same sphere that didn't explode before; you could give it the same kick. But if you _really _want to make it explode, you need to create a new universe. You need to _behave as if _the previous universe still exists\xe2\x80\x94you could call it a "pretending" universe, if that helps.</p><br><p>You could call it a <em>hypothetical</em> universe. The actual universe is very simple, and contains only one Earth, with a single lifeform living there. Everything else exists in an "hypothetical" universe, a set of "somewhat unlikely" universes which could conceivably exist in other parts of space\xe2\x80\x94not to an exact copy of Earth, but rather one very similar to it, albeit not infinite or with a more finite history, that nevertheless could have contained life that evolved in much the same way as our own. Hypothetical universes like that might indeed have come and gone by now, but you need to imagine that they do exist, in order to envision what kind of space you could have been in, if it weren't for the Great Filter.</p><br><p>It may seem strange to you that this is what we actually <em>imagine</em> whenever someone presents it this way. Most people assume of course that there must be a true and actual universe, and if you ask why they believe that, they usually respond by saying something like "That hypothesis is simpler, it's simpler to not imagine that empty void out of the picture...". In the actual universe humans will probably indeed evolve, and we seem to imagine a universe in which they don't exist, in order not to see the emptiness that would result.</p><br><p>It's an important point that this sort of "hypothetical universe" is a possibility, an <em>actual hypothesis</em>, that <em>hasn't happened.</em> Even though we can't see it\xe2\x80\x94because the universe hasn't been empty as we think of it in that hypothetical\xe2\x80\x94it can still exist, in a sense. It's just that you need to make an extra effort to imagine that it could exist. The existence of such hypothetical universes is a feature of your beliefs about space.</p><br><p>A similar observation applies to how you would imagine a universe similar to our own but not-infinite, not-repeating, nor empty of other life than ourselves, etc. Suppose that I told you that I'd created a finite world in a bottle of water and put it in an environment quite different from the place this experiment would normally take place, so that it would be possible to study its behavior. It seems very likely that the water would immediately "evaporate" (as the word is generally used), that in particular, the Earth-like planets that would be there to orbit around the sun, might not be around as long as you might think.</p><br><p>However, it is also quite likely that some alien or other life could evolve on its own planet, outside the bottle. And these beings, on their own Planet Earth, would indeed encounter each other, and would evolve to become intelligent and capable of space travel, thus filling up the remainder of the universe.</p><br><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> This is not the same as saying that the first life wouldn't have been able to leave that planet.</p><br><p>One common version of anthropic trilemma is the Presumptuous Philosopher: the universe has infinite number of observers, but each experiences itself have being a finite number. So the number of observers that <em>could have existed__, but don't</em> is infinite. Yet a common response to this idea is that we can "feel how special we are", in a sense, by feeling like the only beings in existence for such a reason. And indeed, we do have reason to think that we're special. Our place in this universe _is not _as unusual as one might have guessed on first looking at it.</p><br><p>It seems quite likely that the universe we can see, is one with <em>one _copy of Earth, and a bunch of places in space that _could</em> contain a lifeform our approximate size and intelligence, that simply are not there. So our subjective lives and subjective lifetimes might be more or less typical of the universe, and our lives might even be typical relative to the _past and future histories _that would still have been there.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
