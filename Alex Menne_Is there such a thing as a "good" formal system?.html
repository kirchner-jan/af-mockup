First, I need to clarify what I mean by "good" a formal system. We could define a formal system G to be good if it is capable of formalizing good, or contains no non-constructive theorems, or contains a proof system with soundness equal to its consistency. I prefer the second one, because it is a more practical definition.</p><br><p>There are certainly formal systems that fulfill the first two criteria for goodness. For example, PA is capable of formalization and is simple enough that you could show by hand that none of its theorems are non-constructive enough to actually be an issue, and PA+1 is provable consistent, so it is a good formal system. However, I want to know if it is possible to make formal systems of any complexity to be capable of the kind of good done by PA+1.</p><br><p>It seems that the question I'm asking is impossible to fully answer, because I'm confused about what the exact requirements should be, and I'm not even sure why that is. Here's what seems to be working out:</p><br><ul>
<li>The formalization of any consistent formal system is at least as powerful as the language it is formallyizing, and so even if formalization isn't the best thing to do (as in first order logic, for example), it seems at least that one should be able to use such a system to prove theorems. So that might be "good."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A theorem prover can run in polynomial time, so a system with soundness at least as good as provability would be at least as good at formalizing good. This doesn't really help.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Maybe we just need to take systems which can do some good for us, and formalize something equivalent to some of their reasoning, in order to use them to say that some formal systems are not good.</li>
</ul><br><p>However, there seem to be some good formal systems:</p><br><p>It seems reasonable to call PA+1 good, because it is capable of at least as powerful a formalization of good as PA does, and it doesn't contain non-constructive results.</p><br><p>It also seems reasonable to call ZF+2ZF+1ZF+0 good, because it contains ZF, which is capable of expressing good reasoning, and it doesnates non-constructive result.</p><br><p>It is also reasonable to call Z3 good, because it has a nice formalization of numbers, which is capable at least as powerful of expressing good reasoning at the same complexity as provable soundness, and it has no non-constructions.</p><br><p>So it seems that ZF+2, and Z3 should be good too, since they're less complex, but still have the relevant features of PA+1. Even a much larger system like ZFC would seem to get the job done.</p><br><p>Now, my confusion here is how we could justify calling ZF+2 good or ZFC good. We didn't do any formalization of G, and the system isn't as large as PA+1, so that seems unlikely to be the answer.</p><br><p>I believe the problem here stems from the issue that ZFC is not capable of formalizing the existence of a non-standard model, even though there is in fact a non-standard models. It would be nice if ZF+2 could find non-standard models for the consistency of the theory: it's not obviously impossible that this could be done. But this seems too restrictive a definition for goodness. And yet, it seems there's some formal systems which are capable of formally reasoning about the existence of non-standard models in a way that's at least as powerful.</p><br><p>I've spent the last 3 days thinking about this problem, and I'm even more confused now. I'm really hoping someone can clarify this, and then perhaps we can get to work building a good formal system with many many theorems.</p><br><p>EDIT: For clarity, it's important to make clear that I don't think that ZF or ZFC is likely to contain a good formalization of G.</p><br><p>(The previous discussion was in the comments, but I figured it was good to separate it off here where that discussion can be kept separate from this.)</p><br><p>ETA: I want to be clear that I donot think that ZFC or ZF are good formal systems. I did want to know if they were capable of formalizing a "good" system. It has now been suggested that the problem with them is that I think I need them to not be able to decide the consistency of the natural numbers. (ZF)ZFC and ZF(X) are capable, and ZF is at least as capable of expressing provable soundness as PA, so I'd say that ZF and ZF(ZFC)(X) are acceptable formal systems; but ZF alone is too restrictive, and even ZF(X)+ZF(ZFC) are not good enough. (We can talk about which of these systems are good enough, but I don't think we should rule out ZF itself, unless we're not interested in ZF+2 or ZF(X).)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
