</ul><br><p>In this post, I address a number of common objections to the concept of p-zombies: the view that something could be a "physical person" or "person-moment" who exhibits all the outward signs of consciousness, and yet has no conscious experiences at all.</p><br><p>These are "p-zombie" objections <em>not</em> to the classic Zombie World argument. In the classic Zombie World, the Zombie World is an ontologically possible world, and <em>possible</em> people cannot be <em>real</em> people because <em>possible</em> worlds don't contain people. The classic Zombie World leaves no room for objective experience \xe2\x80\x94 even the Zombie World's experiences are just as subjective as ours. In a real world where subjective experiences can and do exist, there can be no p-zombies.</p><br><p>But the new p-zombie objection does make mention of objective experience, and specifically _prohibits _objective experiences from occurring. For example, the standard p-zombie argument often assumes that the Zombie World will not "allow" humans to become "supernatural" due to its lack of ghosts. But in the p-zombie world, "supernatural" means subjective experience has no physical causes and can't be found in brains.</p><br><p>I'll also address an important but overlooked objection to the p-zombies concept: it is logically possible for there to be a universe in which God does not exist. This too should prevent a p-zombie from being said to have existed.</p><br><ol>
<li>The genetic lottery</li>
</ol><br><blockquote>
<p>A random process is one in which you do not consciously anticipate an outcome. You have no control as to what the outcome will be. You have no idea what the future will hold, or what is going to happen. It has no pattern, no order, no organization. That is a random process. _    -- Albert Einstein's definition of entropy_</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p><em>There is no way of thinking at present, according to the constitution of the human mind, that has an anticipation of a future thing, as it were, existing, or at least being part of the idea of its own possibility or actuality.</em> -- <em>David Hume</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>Let me introduce a hypothetical organism called the "Geno-Bot". The Geno-Bot has one neuron in its head, located in an extremely specific spot. If you place a magnet over that neuron, the Geno-Bot will flinch and then instantly stop flinching (as if stung by a bee).</p><br><p>Some people will have an intense experience of pain as they read this, because it's not immediately obvious to them that the organism is a physical thing and not a "brain" in the "body" of some programmer, like the brain-body-identity dualist position claims. If they experience genuine pain, I'll argue that they have an unconscious experience of the Geno-bot, an experience the organism can't have. Indeed, I'll argue the whole experiment is an "experience" of an unconscious experience.</p><br><p>If I can put my hand on the neuron in the organism's head, and you can feel the flinch, the organism must be a physical thing, right?</p><br><p>No, because the neuron is located in a very specific spot in a very specific brain. Where in an ultradensely packed brain is it that the pain arises? Where does the pain arise? In some other brain, in some other brain, that it will never meet in the organism's future? In a different location in the same brain?</p><br><p>If you say "Where does the pain originate? In a brain, right?", then you think with a part of the brain that isn't experiencing pain. To think with the same brain-body that experiences pain is to think with that particular brain, where you experience pain. But brains are physical things, and if there are multiple brains in one organism, it is not the _same _brain that experiences pain.</p><br><p>This is not a complete refutation of dualism, but it is a point in its favor. In particular: dualism says that the brain must be located in a particular region of space. But if the brain is physical, then so _must _the area of space where it is located.</p><br><ol>
<li>Why children matter</li>
</ol><br><blockquote>
<p><em>You know what's a super-valuable thing? A human brain. Think about it. A human brain is about the most valuable thing in the world, bar none.</em> -- Dr. Steven Harris.</p>
</blockquote><br><p><em>Human intelligence has a staggering power to transform our environment and make us the dominant species on the planet....</em>    -- Daniel Dennett</p><br><p>Humans have been around for 5 million years. For most of that time, we were a physically tiny hominids, and hunted big animals all day. In the past 500,000 years, humans have been evolving an intelligence explosion, and our brains have grown 3.5-fold. At this rate, our brains will double in size every 200 years. Thus, for <em>less than a week</em>, our brains will be 10,000 times larger than those of chimpanzees. By the time humans finally become as smart as chimpanzees, the "non-human" label will no longer be relevant.</p><br><p>This means that chimpanzees will never have existed in history. They will be a species born only yesterday. They will never have felt pain. They won't have felt joy. They won't laugh.</p><br><p>And what's more, a species of chimpanzees that did not use language and that lived in a different part of the planet would never have existed. They would be the first group of humans in the entire history of the universe.</p><br><p>Of course most humans will not be as talented as Einstein, who contributed to nearly every scientific field of knowledge. Nor will our descendants be as much fun as chimpanzees can be at all. But it is very difficult to imagine a "non-species-member of the human species' species" that contributes as much to science as Einstein did. It is impossible to imagine a nonhuman whose intelligence and scientific contributions might have exceeded that of a species of chimpanzees who did not have the same genetic lineage. (Maybe that's what the chimpanzee species <em>would</em> have liked you to think?) </p><br><p>Or consider a similar intuition for the concept of "non-person-moment", and an alien species that might have been created from the exact information and exact neurons of the <em>same species</em> as you. In fact, you should probably use the non-person-moments argument to argue that you yourself are not your brain, because it may very well be that some small part of the information in your brain is the information that makes you _you. _Likewise, it may very well  be that some small fraction of your personality is identical to the personality of the chimpanzee species you have just argued is a non-person-species-member.</p><br><p>Humans and chimpanzees will not have <em>exactly</em> the same genes, but we share a <em>line of common descent</em>, and so there must be some information that is shared between us. That information may include our genes, _perhaps _including the specific information that constitutes a full chimpanzee personality, and some additional information that accounts for where this information is located in your brain. Maybe it is in your hippocampus, maybe it is in your prefrontal cortex, maybe it is somewhere else in your brain. This unknown information could be used, and is being used, to answer the above two questions: How exactly is the information that constitutes the full chimpanzee personality copied from the chimpanzee species and what part of your brain does that information exist?</p><br><p>These are all possible interpretations of my original post, and I have even written a paper explaining why I think the full human personality must be represented somewhere in a brain, but it might not be encoded in the specific neurons that constitute the human brain (e.g. in the hippocampus). I would go further and argue that we must have a theory not only of how exactly this copy of the chimpanzee personality is instantiated but what exact physical location it is instantiated in.</p><br><p>As far as I can tell, this is all that is needed for the rest of the argument to go through: we must posit a precise and identifiable location for the chimpanzee personality in the human brain. For example, my initial post assumed that this personality was located in the brainstem. But it is perfectly possible to have a chimpanzee intelligence where the chimpanzee personality must be located somewhere other than that region. Even without a full-fledged chimpanzee society, or a detailed evolutionary history of how humans came to be such intelligent species, the chimpanzee might still be of significant intelligence, but could still not have the level of human consciousness.</p><br><ol>
<li>How is a <em>human</em> a "non-<em>human</em>"?</li>
</ol><br><blockquote>
<p><em>It seems strange... to describe the mind as a "soul."  The soul is a person-moment. It is something that exists in space and has properties that persist through time. We see this in the fact that we know what we mean by the word "soul," when we refer to it. But we can't know what we mean just by what we say. What we mean is indicated by the way we use the word.</em>      -- John Searle</p>
