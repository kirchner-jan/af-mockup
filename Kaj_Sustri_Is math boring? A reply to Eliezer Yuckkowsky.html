If you have ever investigated a real murder case, you likely have a pretty good idea of the type of evidence that tends to be collected during that sort of investigation, so you can form somewhat of a mental picture of what might happen during one. It's unlikely that you'd find the evidence which we normally expect to find, e.g. the killer hiding behind the washing basket.</p><br><p>Of course, it's even less likely that you'd be able to form a mental picture of a modern crime that involved some sort of AI-enabled murder using robots. Yet, if you think about the problem for a minute or so, you might be able to form some sort of mental image of something like this:</p><br><p>The real thing, if anything, would look closer to this:</p><br><p>This picture of a modern murder mystery is meant entirely as a representation; for all you know, you could be presented with a real case from a real case investigation by a detective of today's era and a video camera to witness the event. Nevertheless, it is hard not to be aware that something strange is going on. There's no reason to believe that AI-enabled crimes are going to follow any sensible pattern, even if we were to somehow try to reason our way through the plot. The only sort of pattern that makes sense here is what used to be called "the plot structure".  The only sort of detective that makes sense here might be that of an Agatha Christie, or even better, a Graham Greene. There are certain elements that we expect if we are reading a work of mystery-story, and any modern crime story lacks them. Asimov's robots, for instance, follow the sort of formula I mentioned here, and they would make a good fit for this particular scenario.</p><br><p>In Eliezer Yudkowsky's recent post Mysterious Answers, he claims that this sort of puzzle is precisely the problem of math. Mathematics, he argues, is <em>really really</em> boring, and not just a little bit. He even talks about how children seem to enjoy reading Harry Potter, but would <em>never</em> read Sherlock Holmes. If you're a serious fan of Sherlock Holmes, read HPMoR, and you still wouldn't go to the trouble to read Sherlock Holmes, you're almost certainly not just someone with an unquenchable passion for Sherlock Holmes, you are probably also not someone who thinks that mathematical logic is boring.</p><br><p>Eliezer Yudkowski would (probably) disagree with the claim that there are no mystery-stories with robots in them, but I'm pretty sure that he would <em>still _strongly protest the claim that mathematical logic is inherently boring. And while I don't think that Yudkowsky is _right</em> about the importance of mystery-stories with AI in them\xe2\x80\x94after all, that very argument was the very thing that got me interested in the first place, which is pretty high praise indeed\xe2\x80\x94I do believe that he is talking entirely too much about something that he actually doesn't understand.</p><br><p>The first thing that I want to say is that the idea of the plot structure is, at first glance, actually rather similar to the idea of an AI-enabled crime. Indeed, as I've mentioned, even the original Harry Potter fanfic <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em> contains a couple of instances of an AI-enforced murder mystery. So, if Yudkowsky or someone else can prove that a particular case of AI-enabled crime that follows the plot structure is <em>incredibly interesting</em> on its own account, then that's a very good argument that makes the idea of an "actual mystery-story" as opposed to a fanciful thought experiment or a strawman.</p><br><p>The problem is that I just can't seem to think of any such case which I personally find particularly interesting.</p><br><p>We tend to focus on stories where the main character is an unusually clever and ambitious young girl, which, at least as far as I understand from reading about and watching movies in the genre is an unusual feature for a mystery. But even then, the main character is a <em>human</em>\xe2\x80\x94in other words, an intelligent species living in a world whose problems and challenges seem to be all too familiar.</p><br><p>One recent movie which stands out to me is <em>E. A. Forster's short story "The Machine Stops"</em>, which has been re-made into a movie with this very title. (The original story has been renamed <em>"The Machine Goes to Town"</em> for whatever reason) But the movie contains no robots. Instead, it's a kind of a human-centric crime film about a businessman who is murdered with a bomb by a client.</p><br><p>Now I've only seen a couple of short stories written by Forster. So, I expect that the <em>original</em> story that inspired this particular movie followed the plot structure that Yudkowksy is so strongly criticizing. But I also expect that there are other short stories by Forster which follow the plot structure and are, indeed, as interesting or more interesting than Yudkowkys's own objections.</p><br><p>In Forster's story in particular, if Yudowski is correct about Forster being the root source of the problem of AI-enabled crimes, then I do have some small amount of sympathy to this whole idea, and I even find it somewhat inspiring. I imagine that it has something to do with my own interest in computers and how they can be used as tools rather than agents. For those who are unfamiliar with Forster and the Machine Stops movie in particular, I recommend checking it out before continuing reading further (note: this movie is from the era of celluloid and is available on the DVD as part of the <em>A &amp; F Classic Movie Collection</em>. I'm not sure what's involved for those of other countries, but check e.g. this site).</p><br><p>But even without understanding all of Forster's stories, it seems to me that the central problem of a plot-based mathematical logic is going to be the same in every case. So, if I am being generous, I might assume that there is some underlying pattern to both plots that the stories are trying to point at (perhaps a recurring pattern that all the most beloved stories try to point at and that they all fail to point at, with AI in particular being the recurring theme).</p><br><p>However, the central problem of any plot-based mathematical "logic" is that all your actions take place in a single universe. In Forster's story, the villain\xe2\x80\x94the bomb-carrying client\xe2\x80\x94is clearly represented in Forster's universe, just not as the main character. The main character of the story, by contrast, is a rather standard human being who takes part in fairly standard human activities: her boss tells her to go to work, and she does. And, in his universe, the villain is the robot which has been given the task of building a dam. This is actually an extremely powerful algorithm, given to the job by the hero of Forster's universe. But if the villain in the story is the murderer of the hero, or the villain-in-Forster's-universe, then an algorithm is an algorithm is an algorithms is an algorithm!</p><br><p>Indeed, this is the whole reason why I find the problem with an AI-enlightened plot structure so compelling to me: it makes me feel that it is the kind of a problem that <em>anyone</em> can identify with. To the extent there are other plot structures which fail the same test, I would be somewhat more receptive to the notion that "mathematical logic" is an intrinsically boring topic that <em>only a select few people care about</em>.</p><br><p>And that's precisely the problem, anyway.</p><br><p>People tend to think that the only thing that's important in a crime story is that it has some sort of a suspenseful plot. But really, it's the idea of the <em>human</em> protagonist which hooks us in the first place. When we are reading about the robot and the dam in Forster's story\xe2\x80\x94for that single story, at least\xe2\x80\x94we really don't think that there's going to be any real human characters in Forster's world. It isn't that Forster's story doesn't have any suspenseful parts in it at all\xe2\x80\x94he writes a story that's pretty exciting, in fact\xe2\x80\x94it's just that the main character of the particular story that we are reading about is a <em>robot</em>.</p><br><p>It's the same with Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes is a <em>human character</em> because everyone knows we live in a human world and that any human will tend to be able to be put under some constraints and overcome them by solving the riddle and killing the villain. If Holmes were a robot he would just be as unstoppable a warrior-assassin with a robot body as we are reading about in <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> today, like this one:</p><br><p>Notice the similarities, e.g., the way the <em>robot</em> seems to have a "mental" state and take actions based on that state, similar to a human character from a mystery movie that we actually see. Or, in Forster's case, notice the way that the <em>human</em> is given the command to go to work despite being sick, just like the <em>robot's</em> command.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
