These are the people who are largely responsible for why I chose the field of Artificial Intelligence in university, and what it is that I am actually doing for living. They may be interesting to Less Wrong readers. And they are mostly not my actual childhood role models.  <em>What I Learned From Watching Eliezer Yudkowsky Talk at the MIT AI Laboratory</em> has more to do with my actual models, but these are more from my role as a fan rather than from my actual role model. Anyway, I'll say a bit more about them now.</p><br><p>A few years ago I got into the field of Artificial General Intelligence via the path of artificial life (which, in hindsight, is probably similar to what's been dubbed "Artificial Life" lately)  (There are various forms of 'Artificial Life', and I've seen some of the ones where the programers try to copy how brains work so that they can run on the same computers as brains! Which has, of course, absolutely no chance whatsoever of working.)  This was an exciting period of my life, as I became obsessed.</p><br><p>I got into the idea that perhaps computers, on net, could be seen as "Artificial Intelligences" which could, on net, think and reason in ways not too different from humans and could, on net... Well, you get the point. I was a very confused young fellow, and this was partly due to me having no idea what the hell was really going on at the time. I still had no clue, at the time, about what a "mind" was. A "mind" is a brain's program; an "artificial mind" is a program running on a computer. It still didn't occur to me that perhaps the 'Artificial Mind Research Center' could be taken as a program in its own right, with that program running on a computing machine. I thought computers and brains must be separate. I didn't know about the Internet and everything else that has led to the way the Artificial Intelligence Community is so fragmented. I didn't yet know about the field of AI research, or that AI research was an interdisciplinary field, or that AI and AI research was a field of research separate to and distinct from computer science. And of course, I didn't know that the field of AI had a name: Artificial Intelligence.</p><br><p>So as I followed this idea back to it's sources, I was very confused. "Artificial Intelligence" is a program that runs on a computing machine, but the'mind' which the program thinks and reasons is a brain-like program, a mind being a brain. How are these two different programs supposed to work together? In fact, what makes that'mind' special? My computer, the networked computer, is running a mind, right? Why does the networked computer special?</p><br><p>This was a mind-boggling, confused thought, but it was interesting, so I kept following it...</p><br><p>What if this networked computing machine that runs the mind, and that the mind is running on, could learn from experience, and self-improve?</p><br><p>When it's writing its program, why doesn't it ever go "Okay, I've figured out exactly how the program should think, now I want to change that program."  Why doesn't it ever write out the program in its original form, and then after it's run, go: "Aha! I'm going to come back and tweak that program now, because I have changed my mind about a lot of things, just by running the program."</p><br><p>You can ask all sorts of questions about the program's motivations. It's programmed to self-improve. But why self-improve? That's a very specific motivation. Why not be programmed with the motivation of "I like how what I have created improves in general, and I would like to do more of it"?</p><br><p>You might ask "Why not do so much self-improvement as to be able to rewrite itself in so many ways that it loses track of which of the improvements are due to rewriting the code and which of the improvements were improvements in the original program?"</p><br><p>Well, remember my example about programs playing "Tower of Hanoi?"  It turns out that this is in fact easier (in some ways) for a program to keep track of such details than it is for that program to keep track without such details! It's just that the same program written out more obviously, or to humans less obviously, seems more difficult to work out!</p><br><p>Programming a computer to have a mind that can think about itself seems to me to be in many ways like programming a computer to play Tower of Hanoi! Even the actual thought process of rewriting your source and going back to it to tweak it seems to me to play similar to the actual thought process involved here. Which is not just "trying to figure out a pattern that's easy to grok".  It's like trying to say "Hey! I'm learning from experience!" in an AI program! Can't I just code in the program's motivation of "That's a neat programming trick I figured out by learning from experience from my first program, now I want something better?", and just have <em>that</em> program play Tower of Hadoi and start modifying itself?</p><br><p>But no! I had to be programming the <em>whole</em> thing! Why does it become that much harder to think: "Gee, all this talk of thinking of programs in terms of self-modification is good, but I know what I mean by thinking better and rewriting myself, so why can't I do both of these things in the one program?"</p><br><p>Anyway, I went from being an Artificial Life obsessive to working on artificial intelligence, and thinking about computers as thinking things that can be programmed to think better! So then, as I considered all the possible ways of understanding intelligence, I was excited because I realized that intelligence might still be a property only of the whole, rather than of the components! Why is one program less intelligent than another, if the individual components can be perfectly intelligent?</p><br><p>So I became excited about the question of How to Program Intelligence.</p><br><p><strong>AI</strong></p><br><p>It wasn't just a question of what kinds of computing machines can make themselves smarter, of which were the smarter ones. It was a question of <em>if</em> it's even possible to build a machine that can make itself smarter, that it might be <em>possible</em> to build an Artificial General Intelligence machine. Which, I later figured out, could lead to an Artificial Superintelligence machine!</p><br><p>And if we can build an Artificial Intelligence machine which can design new Artificial Intelligence machines, and so on, what kind of intelligence do you think we will eventually end up with\xe2\x80\x94a superintelligence or superorganisms\xe2\x80\x94at the end of all the programming?</p><br><p>Some people, like Nick Bostrom, think the world would be much better off if the Singularity takes that kind of path and everyone does end up in control of intelligent agents that are all superintelligent in their own right. This idea is referred to as the Singularity to me. I am referring to it as an AI machine that can redesign itself and that will be a superintelligence if that happens, but never a super-superintelligence. The superintelligence isn't in charge of the machine; the machine is in charge of the superintelligence. No one entity is more intelligent than the collective of all the other entities in existence. This is the basic idea I have in mind when I refer to superintelligence.</p><br><p>And I remember having that old confusion of mine from a few years ago still when I first set out on thinking about intelligence, it never occurred to me that the answer to my question about how to program intelligence might ever be as simple as "Just go with the same program over and over until it doesn't modify itself any more".  It just didn't seem possible!</p><br><p>At the MIT AI Lab, I've been programming Artificial Intelligences. You can think of an AI being a mind, which is an "Artificial Intelligence".  And I'm sure there's no shortage of "Intelligent" code running around there, but I'm surprised that any of the Artificial Intelligences are anywhere near self-modifying. If these programs are intelligent in the relevant ways to have an Artificial Intelligence, how come none of them want to rewrite the program, or at least start tinkering with it in any way whatsoever? They're self-modifying the way you program them to self-modify, by running them over and over again, right?</p><br><p>You can also think of this as a question I have about how "smart" the Artificial Intelligence community got the Artificial Intelligents in the first place. They were always there! Computers are always computer programs, which run over and over until something changes. What changed from before they were Artificial Intelligents, and why were they never self-modifying before then?</p><br><p>The answer is that they weren't trying to be smart!  They weren't working on the question of How To Program Intelligence! They weren't trying to self-modification! They were just thinking about computer games! They were playing computer games! They weren't even trying to code up Artificial Intelligents that could be smarter than they were!</p><br><p>You can <em>look at</em> a computer program and see the code for how it works, but you can't actually <em>think about</em> the program and try to program it. There was no way you could possibly have done it before the 1980s!</p><br><p><strong>Who</strong></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
