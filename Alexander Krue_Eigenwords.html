I'm not sure, but I seem to have accidentally stumbled onto something\xe2\x80\x94maybe it's not a word, maybe that's not the right approach. What if a "set" of words is just as interesting as any other "set" of data?</p><br><p>I'm going to define the following as sets of (words) <strong>&gt; eigenwords</strong>:</p><br><p>a set of words W that can't be written as a combination of words in W, such that there exists a partition of W into subsets of size k, such that each Wk is a subset of some Wj, and each word in Wj appears in a unique Wk.Now, the interesting thing is that the length of Wk is in the k-th column, the length of Wj is in the j-th column, and we know that the value of a specific kj is always unique. So, we have exactly k eigenvalue-1 sets Wk of words of length k, and Wj for which Wjk=Wjj+1 (and Wkj+1 must also be in Wk). So, this is exactly k+j (and not just a few) sets with no intersections. (I also think this definition would be helpful for other situations or properties). The following question (and many others) pops up when you look at the first few, the last few, or any word other than W0. I've included my (somewhat incomplete) attempt below; I'd really appreciate any feedback.</p><br><p>_Is there a name for this, or a more canonical phrasing? _If not, the name would be "sets of words that can't be reached from below by words in W, with more than 1 eigensphere".</p><br><p>I have a few questions, starting from the fact that I'm not sure if this is right, but as far as I can see there are some things that are missing from my definition. </p><br><p>First of all, is there a name for any sets of words that are in principle expressible with words in the set plus, for example, "noun", "verb", adverb", etc. (but then we could simply count, and the word set in question would simply be the set where the length is 1 + number of words) For example, my definition would obviously include lists (a list with non-intersecting eigenspaces would work fine, right?) But it also includes sets of words, say, {a, aa, "b", etc}, right? Or in general, sets of words, like {fifty, three, two, five, eleven}? Or is it impossible to even express these words?</p><br><p>I feel like there's something missing. Does the number of words matter at all? Are only finitely many ever expressed? Or does being finite (or infinite) make a big difference? Is there some hidden property that causes this to fail? Maybe an infinite list is just as good as any finite list? This would mean that we can't "count" the dimensions to know how many sets exist, but does that actually count as a "dimension"? Or does it require a topology, or something even more precise than a topology?</p><br><p>If you have a name for this property, or even to know what these are called if they exist, please share/\xe2\x80\x8bcomment, and if you have a proof that it always doesn't exist, please post it as well. Even though it feels like something that should exist, I can't imagine such an eigenword.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
