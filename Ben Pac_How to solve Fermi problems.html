</ul><br><p>How to solve them</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Fermilab____:</strong>  Try and approximate the problem yourself! Write down all the inputs and outputs, as best you can. Then come up with an equation that you know approximately describes what happens, and then try to derive it more precisely from your approximate equations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(This is a method I just invented for doing homework problems on Wikipedia, and is probably a waste of time for most people on LessWrong, but it worked for me and a few others at OpenPhil, so for the sake of those people, I'm writing it out in full here.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Also: this is a method for getting better at approximations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Pareto</strong>:  If a problem has many possible solutions, and all of them are roughly similar, look for solutions that are especially close to Pareto-optimal.  (A Pareto Optimal combination is one that doesn't harm the ability of anybody to do anything: a good outcome for all that can't prevent it in any way).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(This method is especially good at problems with many possible solutions where a bad outcome isn't especially bad of all possible outcomes.)</li>
</ul><br><p>Example</p><br><ul>
<li>Suppose you are an experimental physicist; they are designing a new rocket.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It has to be fast, have a large diameter, and reach orbit.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The payload it can carry is limited to 100 kg, and this weight is a maximum possible size. How much can you make it with 100 kg of payload?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It needs to reach orbital speed on the launch pad, so lets assume that's 300 km/\xe2\x80\x8bh and the rocket only has one control, its thrust</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you assume it has a constant thrust-to-weight ratio, then it needs to reach a height of 100 km or else it doesn't reach space.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A rocket spends about 10 minutes in the atmosphere, and then 10 minutes in space. This gives us a useful equation:</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Atmosphere time=10 minutes</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Space:time=10:10:10</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In space:  For constant thrust-to weight ratio, you can calculate how much time you need to spend in the atmosphere.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We can convert from height to time using the atmosphere equation (which will likely be in a rocket engine manual).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>So we get 10 minutes at 100 km, which would be at 100 km/\xe2\x80\x8bh</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>To find altitude, convert back from time to altitude using the engine handbook equation for thrust to weight, plus the atmosphere equation, and also the altitude (which we can get from the radius and velocity equation).</li>
</ul><br><p>Discussion</p><br><ul>
<li>Fermi problems have the same type signature of the real world.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We have a bunch of variables that depend on each other, but we can't actually measure all of them, and most of them are not known enough to get an exact answer.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>But we can get something really good by building a model that contains a bunch of approximations. Then we can use Fermi-like problems to get a good guess at how well the approximations work.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The key difference is not in how the variables depend on each other; it's in which variables we can <em>assume away</em> entirely.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The variables that can be assumed away are the most important to the problem. The variables that can't be assumed away are much less important and the same.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>One important variable is the thrust-to-drag ratio of the rocket. However, there are probably many approximations that allow us to get a very good estimate of thrust-to-rocket-mass ratio, even without knowing the shape of the rocket.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>One approximation is to ignore the thrust-to wind drag for launch and air resistance during the first 10 minutes.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Another approximation is to ignore air resistance during the last 10 minutes.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In some cases, different approximations apply to different parts of an equation, especially if the approximation has uncertainty in it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We don't care about how fast our rocket is moving in the atmosphere, we just care how fast it is moving after it gets out of the atmosphere.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The question "how fast is my rocket moving in the atmosphere" is not as hard as the question "how fast am I on track to reaching orbit after getting out of the atmosphere"\xe2\x80\x94you just need a model of the atmosphere.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Similarly, if there is uncertainty in the thrust-to mass ratio, different approximators will probably give you very different answers. For example, if you know your rocket is a box of some length with mass m and it will take 10 minutes at 100km at 300km/\xe2\x80\x8bh to reach orbit, this gives you an extremely hard-to-answer approximation to the answer "how fast am i moving".  The other approximators that say they get a much better approximation may depend much less on the precision and uncertainty of your thrust-to-mass ratio.</li>
</ul><br><p>Appendix: Fermi Estimation</p><br><p>One thing I'm having trouble thinking through, as I apply these new methods, is Fermi estimation as applied to real-world problems.</p><br><p>Fermi problems are useful, especially if you want to know something with limited information, and want to learn something while preserving some information that's relevant. But this information is usually an assumption. So you build models from which you can get the value for the things you don't know, and if the thing you don't know varies, you can have uncertainty over different parts of the models.</p><br><p>One question to ask is: how much will things change when I move from being confident, with high uncertainty in the uncertainty, to confident, and not uncertain?</p><br><p>This is a question which should be easy if you use these methods. When you're uncertain about something, you have a bunch of options that are more uncertain than you are; the "true number" of your uncertainty is bigger than the variance of your estimates. So if you think something is uncertain, and do Fermi estimates on what that unknown quantity should be, you're likely to be more uncertain after doing it.</p><br><p>Another question to ask is how I'll adjust my estimate if the uncertainty from other sources is taken into account.</p><br><p>Suppose I am trying to estimate a rocket launch. I don't know how well my models will predict reality, or what sorts of things might affect reality. At launch time I have some uncertainty about this. But my uncertainty is much less than the uncertainty from things like model limitations (which is how I can do Fermis), and any uncertainty caused by my model uncertainty. It's a reasonable hypothesis that my uncertainty will end up as roughly equal to the uncertainty of other sources, to a good approximation. In practice this question probably won't be settled until a few minutes after the launch has taken place.</p><br><p>But another question is this: if there is a problem on a launch day (like one of the engines failing), then the uncertainty in model uncertainty will go up. How much uncertainty should I expect to see on that day, if I did Fermis and found that the uncertainty went up in the model uncertainty?</p><br><p>A third question is: if I have models for other things, and I can consider what effects the uncertainty caused by the rocket launch will have on them, how much uncertainty should I put in? For example: I know that if it rains on the launchpad, I can't do a particular thing, and the model includes that. But I could also put uncertainty for other things into that model, such as how often there will be rain, etc.</p><br><p>Another third question is: suppose there is a failure of prediction, and some other rocket is in space, or on the pad, or it took another 10 minutes to even launch. How should I act on "what I predicted happened"? Maybe I should just do Fermic estimates until I get really confident and precise (but that takes a bit), and then update based on what actually happened? Or maybe it's too difficult, and I should just be okay with a very imprecise prediction?</p><br><p>More to the point: all of the above might be really wrong, and really important. If I do Fermis, and they don't account for some important effect, or my estimate fails to be precise or I forgot to take into account a few other variables, then I'm going to be systematically off, and my model might be pretty important for understanding what will happen.</p><br><p>The same idea applies to a lot of things in life. For example: suppose the government does an economic analysis of a proposed policy. The analysis uses this model: "We have 5 variables, and they can be set to these values, and this system gives us some answer which will be very close to the answer we want."  But in reality, they used a bad model, or are wrong about the important things, so the model is actually very different. How should I behave on the basis of this model? In particular, how should I estimate the uncertainty in the model?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
