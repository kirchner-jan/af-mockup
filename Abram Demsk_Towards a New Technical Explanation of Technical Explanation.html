</ul><br><p>[Crossposted from IAFF.] </p><br><p>I have long found it dissatisfying that mathematical explanations of mathematical explanations end up spending an inordinate amount of real effort and time justifying the use of models, and explaining models when there are clearly superior models available; and spending inordinate amounts of time talking about the difficulty of obtaining a desired level of resolution given a particular understanding of that model, so that anyone seeking to understand the subject can see how the model is supposed to help them understand the subject, rather than spending any more than an epsilon of that time explaining why the model really does make the difference it makes. I've previously made some comments about the general principle over years, and have even spent time trying to improve some models to be more easily usable.</p><br><p>But there's a new post, "Towards a New Technical Explanations of Technical Explanation", which goes beyond the general principle to present something of a blueprint for a new technical explanatory model, which I think might help in improving technical explanatory models, and perhaps even help fix some of the problems in existing models. (The post doesn't quite say <em>exactly</em> what I'll be doing, but hopefully it will be easier to read than this post.)</p><br><p>Technical Explanation: Contextuallising</p><br><p>In order to think about explanatory models, or even something like a model of the "technical understanding" of an abstract object, it is necessary that we abstract away an enormous amount of details and context. In math, the details of the objects we're trying to explain usually consist of an undecidable infinite set of axioms. If we think in terms of a mathematical "model", defined as a set of <em>pairs</em> of a proof-encoding and a description-encoding, where the description-encoding need not just be a finite string, but also need to be computable, but we'll leave all the details out of the definition. A mathematical argument is a way to encode a mathematical structure as a string. A mathematical judgment is a particular mathematical string. Given an arbitrary string representing a mathematical argument, it is not at all easy to find what mathematical structure a mathematical judgment represents.</p><br><p>But we will always have certain mathematical arguments encoded as a particular string, and we will use these to define "explanations". An explanation is an explanation of a particular mathematical string, by some particular mathematical structure which you can read off of the string.</p><br><p>A mathematical explanation is defined in terms of sets of mathematical strings, and the goal, from our perspective, is to find a way to read a particular mathematical structure off of particular mathematical strings, or to find a way of writing that structure into the strings in order to simplify the explanation.</p><br><p>If the mathematical argument defining a particular mathematical structure consists entirely of recursively defined infinite mathematical statements, then this problem cannot be fully expressed in terms of mathematical strings, since it does require infinite computation. Since the whole difficulty lies in the context, an explanation is necessarily able to include the whole of this context in addition to the target mathematical structure.</p><br><p>We can further improve our model in several ways. Perhaps we can restrict ourselves to only part of the context. Perhaps we can specify the target mathematical structure to give us part of the context in our explanation. Perhaps we can allow the context to include partial pointers to mathematical structures.</p><br><p>Even if we have to allow our explanations to include some of the context as a string, it is still the case that this requires that the context encode a very large part of the mathematical structure, since the mathematical structure is itself defined in terms of a particular mathematical argument encoded in a single string. Thus, at least part of the description of the mathematical structure in the explanation is given in terms of other mathematical structures in the context.</p><br><p>As examples to motivate this:</p><br><p>The G\xc3\xb6del sentence, whose form as a mathematical argument may have you puzzled at first look, is actually a <em>statement of G\xc3\xb6del numbering</em>. Its truth condition is: "The unique integer which represents a mathematical sentence in the language of Peano Arithmetic if its G\xc3\xb6del number (the particular bit-string encoding in binary) starts with 011,..." or equivalently: "The first integer x such that the first 4n bits of the G\xc3\xb6del number encoding of the sentence, 0x110101...0x100110010010011001001..., is the G\xc3\xb6del number..." or equivalently, "The proof of this sentence, if the integer encoded by a proof-encoded G\xc3\xb6del number of it is a theorem, is an element of Peano Arctica in the theory".</p><br><p>I have a very vague idea of how to explain G\xc3\xb6del numbering without using Peano Arithmetic, but G\xc3\xb6del numbering is something you can prove in Peano Arithmetic anyway (it is provable in any weaker theory), so G\xc3\xb6del numbering is a sort of example of mathematical structure you can encode into Peano Arithmetic itself. Thus, a mathematical theorem or its proof may be explained by <em>first</em> encoding the proof in Peano Arctica as a G\xc3\xb6del number, and then <em>then</em> explaining the G\xc3\xb6del number in terms of the number encoding.</p><br><p>Similarly, the number encoding an integer N is a part of the Peano Arithmetic encoding of the natural numbers, and hence the Peano Arctica encoding of the natural integers as a set of integers has a subset encoding as the unique integer which represents that natural integer in the natural encoding. Similarly, a mathematical proof, which is a subset which encodes a natural integer as a G\xc3\xb6delian number, is encoded as a G\xc3\xb6del string. This may be a little trickier than just taking the number encoding and calling it 'n'.</p><br><p>So the goal is to abstract away the context as much as possible when computing an explanatory model. This is made much more difficult if we allow the context to also encode pointers to mathematical structures in that context. These pointers, even if they consist of sequences of theorems rather than just a single theorem, will still have to encode significant mathematical structure by virtue of containing mathematical structures.</p><br><p>Also, in our usual definitions of string, a string which contains a proof-encryption may have multiple copies of itself encoded within it, and, potentially, multiple strings encoding parts of mathematical structures within the context-in-which-we're-talking-about-the-part-we're-explaining. This makes it difficult to efficiently enumerate all possible strings for the purpose of explanation.</p><br><p>So how can we more efficiently parse a given mathematical argument, and, more importantly, how can we efficiently read the mathematical structure off of the relevant mathematical arguments within the context they're embedded in?</p><br><p>A Toy Model of Technical Explanation</p><br><p>One might say we could simply treat any mathematical argument as a tree, where the root is the mathematical structure you have to explain, and each leaf node is a string encoding that mathematical structure. The mathematical structure for its self is its parent, and the string for its <em>direct _children are parents _of that direct child</em>.</p><br><p>We can use this to improve our original model:</p><br><p>Instead of specifying that the strings representing a mathematical structure and its definition are in the context, we could let them be in the context's own contexts and contexts <em>of their own children</em>.</p><br><p>This allows us to specify things like "the number one-third of the children" or "the first child with a length of three" or even "what's the first child of <em>this</em> subtree, i.e., the child whose parent is the subtree consisting of the child and the parent of that child."</p><br><p>This model doesn't explicitly say that a particular parent should be read in a particular way in order to read the parent's child, as far as I can tell. It just says that the structure is defined in terms some particular string encodings, and then the direct children of a particular child in the context correspond to "how are we to read them?"</p><br><p>For the special case where we're looking for the first child of a particular subtree (a context which itself has some particular children), you could treat the subtree as the context in which we're parsing a tree, and just encode "the particular first child" as a particular child of that subtree.</p><br><p>We can represent this entire process formally as a single recursive tree, whose root is a sequence of mathematical arguments.</p><br><p>Tensions Between Convexy and Exactness</p><br><p>In practice, we often <em>also</em> want information which is <em>not _available even in the limit of infinite computing power. We want to explain _particular</em> mathematical structures, as opposed to only being able to explain "every <em>possible</em> mathematical structure". This is particularly the case for us when we're talking about concrete structures in the natural numbers, like the naturals. The set of naturals contains all natural numbers, and if you give us just this, we know no reason to be confident that the set isn't infinite.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
