But if you accept that humans have evolved to rely on search engines rather than books, then it seems pretty likely that something in the vicinity will happen.</p><br><p>To see why, let's return to the idea which I mentioned previously, that the human memory storage space in which "long-term" memory lives, is just not that big. It's pretty tiny. I don't know how big it is exactly\xe2\x80\x94some studies put it around 30 bits, others point at the thousands of bits involved\xe2\x80\x94but I do know that the human brain's long-term memory storage is <em>really tiny</em>.</p><br><p>We know this because, once upon a time, everyone seemed to agree that the human brain ought to be able to store vast amounts (gigabits) of information. This was the justification for using magnetic hard drives, with gigabits of storage per disk, rather than a RAM disk. (The former was considered more reliable.)</p><br><p>Yet, while a magnetic hard drive stored gigabits of information, the human brain actually only stores about 40 bits (at best) of information per second*\xe2\x80\x94less than a millisecond. And because the information is accessed (read and written) so frequently, that's like using a RAM disk. So if a few gigabits were enough back in the day, why would anyone use the less reliable magnetic hard drive?</p><br><p>I could speculate a little, but that sounds more like philosophy than science. So I think it's fair to say that today, nearly everybody agrees that humans really can't store that much information.</p><br><p>So it should be quite a big surprise if we discover some way to create computer networks in which the "memory storage" is orders of magnitude larger than today\xe2\x80\x94say, terabytes instead of hundreds of gigabits.</p><br><p>This is a scary idea if you think you're just going to store a few videos on a hard drive, and you want it to have a big database! But this is really an <em>awe-inspiring</em> possibility if you think about how the human brain does it, because we do it <em>already;</em> we just don't have a very strong theoretical understanding of how.</p><br><p>Anyway, I'm speculating a bit in the course of arguing that the internet <em>might</em> be the future of human learning. It's a reasonable hypothesis, but why should I think it's a likely one? Because I know of no <em>other</em> possibility which is even <em>half</em> as promising.</p><br><p>So I'm not going to speculate, really, beyond just saying "because you can <em>imagine</em> seeing this". And I'm only arguing that if Google manages to keep their technology from getting out into ordinary people, <em>then</em> the internet <em>might be</em> the future of human memory.</p><br><p>One way to think of this, is that we could think of a brain as a huge distributed Rube Goldberg R&amp;D platform for a species that is pretty poor at technological innovation, but pretty good at accumulating knowledge.</p><br><p>If the internet was destroyed tomorrow, then the human species would probably get its act together pretty fast, and figure things out once more. But if the internet was destroyed, then the <em>future</em> of human knowledge would probably be stored on <em>Google</em>, and not in human brains.</p><br><p>Now, this is still just pure speculation. I don't think I even really understand the science that tells me when I'm speculating. But what if this is true?</p><br><p>I think one of the important parts of this is that it will be <em>a very big change</em>.</p><br><p>Like, a few hundred years ago, a few brilliant inventors may have made a prototype of the transistor, and then given it to the world. <em>At that time</em>, the rest of the world had the same beliefs about the future of technology as we do today. The world wasn't a single big Rube Goldberg R &amp; D platform centered on humans.</p><br><p>Today we've come so far in technological knowledge, that even the most <em>incredibly stupid</em> ideas in the world are rejected by intelligent experts for good reason. We don't have to worry much about the future of knowledge.</p><br><p>I hope I don't sound too alarmist about this. After all, some experts actually like the status quo. For example, many people in the transhumanist community have advocated cryonic revival. It may sound crazy, but if you've got a brain the size of an insect on ice, it might be worth having a backup.</p><br><p>If cryonics works, after we invent the technology for cryonics, and the future history of society does not look like a very large Rube Goldberg Rube Goldberg RUBE graph, then it's possible to see that cryonics is an effective way to backup future human knowledge.</p><br><p>But if cryonics <em>doesn't</em> work, then maybe having a backup is <em>even more important</em> in the future, because we got in the habit of building big brains and maybe it won't be worth it the future. To quote Luke Muehlhauser: "it may be helpful to have an independent backup of your important memories stored on some other form of non-volatile media than your brain."</p><br><p>And that's why I'm <em>not</em> trying to sell you on saving your brain's data on a hard drive\xe2\x80\x94although it would be a cool thing to be able to do.</p><br><p>(For a fun illustration of the difference between a long-term and medium-term memory, remember that "long-term memory" can be something on the order of 2 weeks, "medium-term memory" on the order of 1-2 seconds, but that both kinds of memory can be used to store <em>facts</em>.)</p><br><p>Now, let's say that we end up doing something along the lines described in Yudkowsky's "Hackers, Lovelers and the New World", where the internet is a "hackable" system. There's a massive distributed research project going on all the time, consisting of hundreds of millions of people contributing their own knowledge and experience to the collective endeavor. This probably wouldn't be too hard to start now if somebody could just <em>start</em>, but it might be <em>really hard</em> to take over the project later, because the people with the incentive to do the important work would be gone.</p><br><p>This scenario, if it actually worked, would change the nature of how humans think about knowledge. Instead of some genius inventors being the stars of history, everyone could become a superstar simultaneously by participating in the "hacks" involved in creating knowledge.</p><br><p>So if you think you've got a big idea, or know something important, <em>maybe you should spend a few hours Googling around before sharing it with the world.</em> You wouldn't have to <em>trust</em> anyone\xe2\x80\x94we already have systems for dealing with fraudulent claims of knowledge, which is something that isn't really a problem <em>anywhere else</em>.* (I should mention that I am really, really <em>not</em> advocating that Google <em>should</em> make it difficult to make a fake account and publish a book full of crap.) But maybe it would be a good idea at least to <em>consider</em> whether Google's search engine had already indexed whatever thing you wanted to publish and whether it could be found on http://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.google.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b."</p><br><p><strong>Elianzer Yudkowksy</strong>  </p><br><p><em>[The idea here is meant as a counterpoint to a very common trope which is "people are stupid"</em>\xe2\x80\x94_in a sense this is right and wrong. At the same time, humans are so different from chimplies that, for all intents and purposes, chimplies are probably not "stupid", nor are any other organism or machine that existed in the pre-human past.
