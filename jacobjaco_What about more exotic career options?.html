<li>How one might go about finding these careers</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Existing opportunities</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My approach</li>
</ul><br><p>I've been reading some career books and blog posts, and collecting some tips for working in these careers.</p><br><p>For a number of these occupations, people have good general advice, but this doesn't seem to apply to every one. So I wanted to share what I've learned. While many people have some experience of these careers, and some general information about it, I don't think much has been written specifically on LessWrong (but see the comments), and there's much more that could be written on the topic.</p><br><p>In this post I'll share some concrete career ideas, and some thoughts on why I personally want to pursue these careers (at least initially). The career ideas were developed in collaboration with Michael Littman.</p><br><p>How one might go about <em>finding</em> these careers</p><br><p>With one exception on the list, not all of these jobs are available to people without a relevant degree or certification. Without said degree, people with less than relevant experience may have a tough time. So, if you're not in that category, you need to find an existing path to one of them.</p><br><p>This post is not very detailed about the paths people have to undertake to work in these professions: it instead focuses on their various advantages and disadvantages, along with a description of what skills they typically need. So if your main concern in pursuing one of these jobs is how long and difficult the path might be, this post is less likely to be useful to you.</p><br><p>These paths may involve things like being able to write great code, have strong analytical skills, or being able to get along with people. They're also often not available to people who are currently working in their current roles, who are not programmers, or who may not be people who can do great things without great support. (Note that I don't have a concrete idea of where to go on this front, so if you do have suggestions, please let me know).</p><br><p>Existing opportunities</p><br><p>My overall view is that these jobs tend to be ones that people want to work in, but are not currently pursuing. I think that there are several ways in which this can cause harm:</p><br><ul>
<li>It's tempting to get depressed by not having a concrete path that leads to a job you want, or otherwise see things as hopeless or futile. But that's often not the case. While no matter how promising a non-job seems at first glance, there's always things you can do to advance in it. More on this later.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It's tempting think about what you could do that people around you don't, and to have unrealistic expectations of what success will bring. But, even if you are currently at the same level as your colleagues, that still includes learning things at a pace that allows you to make progress, as you continue learning more. In my experience, even people who seem very bright are sometimes slower learners than I am, and there are lots of areas beyond the field of computer science you can learn in, some of which will open up new career paths for you.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It can be hard to find good advice /\xe2\x80\x8b relevant resources, because (at least for me) every career advice post seems equally valid to me. But, I've now made enough progress that things feel clearer and more certain to me, and there are a few things I can say about careers in general that may allow others to better learn.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Even if you figure out how to build the relevant skills, it can be hard to know if you'll have the chance, or what you'll have to do. So I think it's especially important to get started now, when there are fewer potential career opportunities in your area of expertise.</li>
</ul><br><p>So, then: if you know that you'd like to be in a similar job, but don't know how to make the transition, here are a few ideas:</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Learn new skills.</strong> Maybe the things you'd like to learn, or things you'd like others to think you know if you were working in the field, are things you know are lacking and want to fix. You might be able to figure out what these are, and begin to learn them, or to find someone who has already done so, and to learn through them. If you do learn them, you're more likely to enter the field. (Of course, some learning will be for your own benefit, but also, the ability to learn and succeed at the job may depend on the skill, and how hard it is to learn). More on this later, under "Building a stronger skill set".</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Join a local group or online community, that will have members who are working toward becoming in that position</strong>. <strong>Some are looking for jobs in the field, in others are trying out a few different paths</strong>, and some are just generally looking for good sources of information with respect to work in that field. If you look for a local group /\xe2\x80\x8b community with members who have achieved similar levels to your own, to people who have already been in the field for similar amounts of time to you, and for people to talk to regularly and help each other understand career advice, you can start to understand the landscape of the field to a level you only ever saw in your textbooks and/\xe2\x80\x8bor your colleagues. (If you look for either online community, it is important to go through any communities you join, to make sure things are what they say they are, and that people who are posting and commenting are actually trying to help.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Do what most of your peers do.</strong> I've found that if I copy the career advice I see on LessWrong, and go out and do what I see other people doing, they're generally doing this well, and I've been able to improve significantly.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Build a stronger career portfolio</strong>. This can help with a number of things, like</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Building up a track record of the skills you've learned, so that potential employers get a better sense of you and can figure out how much they'll benefit by hiring you.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Doing better in classes, to show that you can learn things and are actually interested, and so you can get better at learning them in the future.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Helping you navigate the system better: a good starting point for this might be to research what your institution (or other potential employer) recommends in terms of degrees and degrees from specific universities. If the institution of some people's careers is really bad, this can be a very useful career path to try out (I don't know of this being discussed around LW though). </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Learn more about the field.</strong> There are a number of resources available to help, both in academic publications that you might want to start to study, and, again, in local communities and communities online. By gathering resources like this, you can improve your understanding of the field, and what it might offer you in terms of personal and career options. </li>
</ul><br><p>My approach</p><br><p>Some of these career paths could only be pursued if you're already quite certain about what your goals and priorities are. But, depending on where you are currently at, that might be a good place to start.</p><br><p>Another good place to start is, once you've figured out why you want to pursue these career options in the first place, to look into them and try to figure out what is likely to be the most difficult parts of the paths, so that you can be better prepared.</p><br><p>Note that although some of the career paths are open to people in general, some are more accessible to people who already have some particular skills, others are more accessible to others, and you may be best off looking in one field or another.</p><br><p>I'll elaborate more about these, when I get further in with them and when I have more information.</p><br><p>In the next post I'll tackle my next career suggestion, which is <strong>consulting</strong> for software companies. And one more before that, on finding more concrete job ideas.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
