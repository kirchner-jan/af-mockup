It's not the only thing I think about, but there's a general theme here. Some are also trying to understand the role science has played in society. As far as I know most of what's on LessWrong is about science, maybe that's because the culture of modern science is the culture of modern civilization, and that was already covered on RationalWiki and elsewhere. I don't have the background I'd need to tackle it head-on. Instead, I'm hoping that the history of modern science can provide some indirect insight on the history of the scientific culture itself.</em></p><br><p>For the first time in human history we know everything about our universe. And that's something like a blessing or a curse. It enables us to take all the time that was previously lost to our ignorance and use it to figure out what's really going on in the world around us. On the other hand, if we were to stop looking things up, we would start losing important knowledge and would become ever more subject to ignorance. It became possible that the whole process of intellectual progress\xe2\x80\x94the improvement in our understanding of reality\xe2\x80\x94might be running at cross-purposes. We might not be interested in all the knowledge we already have, and we might not be interested, in what might be discovered in the future. It's as if something had gone off the rails and we are in search of a way out.</p><br><p>But when is that something that would go off the rails? Well, it's hard to put when exactly it would happen, but for example when science gives us answers where no answers existed before. It seems to have made possible a way out when we reached a region where our knowledge of how the world worked could give us some hints as to where our knowledge needed to go. In fact it almost seems like science made possible a <em>new</em> form of ignorance. It's possible that we could know almost everything about most of the fundamental forces in our universe, have done the calculations, and yet still be ignorant of our place and purpose in the universe.</p><br><p>I used to wonder whether I could trust science if I thought there was something beyond the known dimensions of the universe, but the moment I saw that there were dark and light modes of matter, and the evidence that they had mass and were traveling at different speeds. So how could I do any work without any notion of <em>what</em> was out there? But then I heard that there is no need to fear the unknown because we are just one kind of matter in an infinite universe, the same way that there's only one kind of matter we humans are made of. There's no place for an infinite universe to come from, because in the same way the laws of physics are the same everywhere in space, the laws of physics must be the same everywhere in time (the Big Bang). And when you consider that the laws of physics were universal to the point of being identical in the entire universe so many times after the first moments that any intelligent life must be universal, you begin to see how humanity's first and foremost goal ought to be to be truly universal in its quest for knowledge.</p><br><p>But I think this whole line of reasoning, and even the idea that the future must not have a problem because the universe is infinite, is actually a rather naive way into a serious confusion about the nature of human knowledge. Because what if there is something about human knowledge that makes it incapable of knowing that it's impossible to know that it's impossible? Suppose that instead of trying to understand this, science comes up with a solution. Then it seems that our knowledge would become not universal but <em>special</em>. That it can only know its world <em>from outside it</em>. It would have found a form of knowledge that knows its form of knowledge, but we'd need to have already known such a form to find it. Only at that point our knowledge would not be knowledge.</p><br><p>That being said, I think this is a difficult confusion to avoid when you consider some of the more modern scientific disciplines that come to the field of mind/\xe2\x80\x8bbrain/\xe2\x80\x8bbehavior/\xe2\x80\x8bphysics/\xe2\x80\x8betc. such as cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. These studies often involve looking at our knowledge in the light it creates and shows it to us\xe2\x80\x94the "knowledge", for example, that we experience as consciousness. Our knowledge is never a pure passive observer, it sees the knowledge itself in an active context that it creates to make it more transparent, that shows us more about the nature of our minds. The studies in cognitive science, for example, don't just treat neuroscience as some kind of neutral third party who looks at human behavior and reports its observations back (because of course there are all kinds of cognitive biases that distort the picture of the brain we see). Instead they take our most basic beliefs about the human mind, for example, about the nature of consciousness and try to understand what's going on inside human brains as a result, and how knowledge about the mind can produce and cause knowledge about the brain. I think this aspect of doing science can also be misleading given that humans are animals, and we don't see ourselves as animals because we look down on ourselves, but rather because we understand that we are animals, and therefore have been trying to escape our animal nature.</p><br><p>But the science of mind is in the process of developing an understanding of the nature of the animal mind that enables it to know its nature, in particular in terms of what the unconscious is. To me it seems that the reason a lot of modern physics is now more or less an unconscious theory is that it has achieved the same level of understanding of how to think, feel, and act like a human that has been reached as a direct result of the scientific study of mind. As a consequence of this understanding, the science and the method of science seem no longer to be outside the self, but have become, in a certain way, the self of the thinking mind.</p><br><p>Thus the kind of "knowledge" that a person would have of the nature of their mind seems to have become a form of knowing our minds that we know not only by looking at our mind, but in part by knowing it by looking at our <em>mind knowing our mind</em>. We know our mind by looking at a knowing of our mind, but our knowledge of the nature of our mind is part of what we know about our mind.</p><br><p>Let's consider the example of artificial intelligence that tries to understand human intelligence in terms of neural networks. It seems that in the beginning a lot of its assumptions about the nature of intelligence were probably the result of experiments done to demonstrate the power of neural networks as a model of the human mind in other areas (in particular in areas like natural language processing). When they understood that the human mind really works by learning neural networks rather than by a different kind of learning we call "desirability" (i.e. you've got it right this time, it tastes good but what would happen if you were to eat more of it), they got more and more curious about learning, but also about the limits of what neural networks can know about itself.</p><br><p>But now it seems that we can use the scientific method to learn things not just about the inner structure of the brain, but also about how this structure interacts with the environment. In particular, we can learn how the outer mind works in the light that it creates to find it. When it creates the knowledge of consciousness, then a lot of other areas of knowledge come together in a new way that enables them to know what would be a new form of knowledge\xe2\x80\x94what is an understanding of our consciousness. That being said, this is not the knowledge in question in the area of science that the artificial intelligence would actually need to create its self in order to have a self that can know its self, and we wouldn't want it to be based on our ignorance. When you consider the possibility that not everything we really know about ourselves has been found, but that it's all part of the fabric of our minds that we discover, then the discovery process itself becomes just as much a part of the thing the discovery of knowledge is seeking to know about as it is when we discover it for the first time.</p><br><p>To be continued in the next post of this sequence: the map that is not the territory.
