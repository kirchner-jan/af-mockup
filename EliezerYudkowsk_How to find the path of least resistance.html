This might seem like an obviously good heuristic, but if you look around at any group that gets together regularly to have fun, you may have noticed that everyone there is doing something that doesn't seem to <em>work</em>.  (See "The Secret of our Success", in which I discuss my own failure to find friends who seemed just as fun as me.)</p><br><p>I will offer you this heuristic:  If there is a low-intensity path of least resistance in your direction of travel, go take that low-intensity path. Otherwise, it will have occurred to someone first and there's a good chance they're in exactly the same frame of mind yourself.</p><br><p>This is not the only heuristic I've ever heard. It is not even especially optimized. For example, a standard heuristic on LW might be that it is okay to say "I don't know" a hundred times, and that this proves you've searched the solution space.</p><br><p>Nonetheless:  If you're in a group meeting to have fun, there will probably be a low-intensity way for that meeting to go. You may not be _sure _that it would go like this\xe2\x80\x94maybe the low-intensity way is just "let's play Scrabble for an hour"\xe2\x80\x94but this way of travel is probably a heuristic for finding it easier and more rewarding to be a part of the group than trying something else like "lose at least five dollars" or "write each other 100 letters per minute while trying not to laugh".</p><br><p>As a consequence, there's probably a low-intensity heuristic for finding the most fun thing to do, that you are not already doing.</p><br><p>Or alternatively:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>_A heuristic for finding a low-intensity, unplanned path of least resistance:  Look around and see if there's any sort of group that doesn't want to do "fun-with-fun" more than you do. If so, you probably don't have to worry\xe2\x80\x94it's already happened.  - _</p>
</blockquote><br><p><em>\xe2\x80\x94</em></p><br><p>I also suggest looking for a path of least resistance on all available dimensions.</p><br><p>If there is some unplanned path of low-intensity fun, find those elements on which you are not already working and take that low-impact path. Conversely, there are probably also things you could do <em>on purpose</em> to make for an even more fun meeting. To think of anything at all may be a sign that this meeting is not the one to go with your goal.</p><br><p>(It's also useful to remember that a group can be made fun without having fun by getting together to do the expected things in a conventional way without _imagining _how anyone can possibly be having fun.)</p><br><p>A good heuristic for any social event is "If I don't know what's to do and there's nothing on the schedule, I'm probably not in the right frame of mind to enjoy myself."  If you're at a party in Texas, you might also want to consider the possibility that you <em>are</em> in Texas and are having fun but the people you've invited think Texas is a different place.</p><br><p>To help you figure out which path of least resistance to take, I will mention some heuristics that seem useful to me for finding low-impact ways to have fun.</p><br><p><strong>Heuristic:</strong>  Try some things your brain considers low-impact, and see how they turn out; notice the difference between yourself and people who did something that worked well to them while you didn't and what happens next.</p><br><p><strong>Example:</strong>  Maybe you thought you'd have fun taking a walk along the ocean, but it turns out that you can't bring yourself to walk on that particular beach, and so you're doing something low-impact that works well for you, even though you've failed to find the right path.</p><br><p><strong>Additional heuristics:</strong>  For low-impact activities that haven't worked before, try a couple of things; they may turn out okay. Try doing the activity that worked best in the last group meeting you went to. Be sensitive to the possibility that you've picked the wrong group. Try to think of a low-impact thing to do with a little extra thought on purpose.</p><br><p>__Not-so-good heuristics: __For low-impact activities _that don't have to be low-impact, _try them on purpose, and see what happens.</p><br><p>Another heuristic I often use:  Pick an activity that will probably be fun even if you don't have the goal that's motivating you now, and _then _set your sights on that motivational goal.</p><br><p><strong>(This may end up sounding like an excuse to try things on purpose and see what happens.)</strong></p><br><p>If it is an especially fun group meeting, it can be tempting to let your brains drift and relax into fun-with-fun without <em>thinking _of your real plan. If there's a heuristic for thinking of fun-with-function, _go find that heuristic and use it</em>\xe2\x80\x94if you don't have one and there's a low-impact path, <em>go and take it.</em> Don't let your brain drift away from the _real _goal while you're _still _motivated by it.</p><br><p>"Do something fun by accident, then try to make the heuristic work."</p><br><p>This is a little harder than it sounds, and you have to be careful not to let your motivation drift. But I consider this a _very good _heuristic\xe2\x80\x94at least compared to the heuristics I would prescribe to others; most heuristics that _sound sane _don't end up being sane. If "try the same thing you did last time" sounds good to you, then maybe try something different that sounds good to you.</p><br><p>This may be <em>harder to think about _than it sounds, because it's hard to think of a particular path where </em>"let's just relax!" <em>doesn't sound like a good plan. _To find the path of</em> _least resistance, you're supposed to search the solution space\xe2\x80\x94not just for ways to do things that sound nice and have positive social repercussions, but for actual ways to do things.</p><br><p>There's a temptation to just <em>try things _on accident, and the human brain doesn't want to search the solution search space that carefully. But it isn't good to try, but _not search</em>, and then fail to find a useful path. So it may be useful to pause and try and search for a low-impact, unplanned fun-path on all the dimensions you can think of, and _on purpose! _</p><br><p>There's also a temptation to follow the group without thinking of what's worth doing, and in <em>that</em> case, you've forgotten (or never noticed in the first place) the goal. So if someone is in a group meeting <em>with the explicit purpose of not noticing the goal__, _then that is a _good</em> situation! It means you've found a path of least effort, and that means you have to go take it without thinking!</p><br><p>In _that _case, your best bet is to do the fun thing that sounds interesting or cool to you (though if you have to do it on purpose, you may need to try a few).</p><br><p>If there exists a particular path of least resistance that can be found within some class of possibilities, but that can't be found by browsing <em>just around fun-with-friending</em> or some other class of possibilities... then try the same class of possibilities for finding the path of least _overlap _with the goal.</p><br><p>If a group can be fun without having fun, and you don't know what the goal is, there might in fact be a low-overlap, low-intensity way to have fun, that can easily be found.</p><br><p>The important idea is to know what <em>the goal _is, or _the path in the solution space _that led from how things were to them having fun or _getting along with people</em> or <em>getting away from the table,</em> if you're in a social situation.</p><br><p>That may be hard to think of initially, so here are some starting thoughts on what the goal might be:</p><br><ul>
<li>Be a good guest.  (Not everyone likes guests\xe2\x80\x94you're looking for the things that work.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Help others.  (If you want people to stop talking to you, this heuristic will probably fail. If you're good friends, they might be fun enough to stay that way.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Don't embarrass or ruin any friendships you've already made.  (See the previous heuristic!)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Have a good time.  (See "the secret of our success", last link.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Keep out of a particular kind of trouble.  (See previous links.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Help out, or join in.  (Same thing\xe2\x80\x94if you want people to like having you around, you need to be doing things with them, or at least <em>with them having fun.</em>)</li>
</ul><br><p>If you're like me, you think it's fun when you notice a path of least resistence to do some fun-thing.  (But you <em>don't</em> want to do the exact thing that will work\xe2\x80\x94you're looking out for ways you might possibly <em>fail _to reach your goal, and ways to take a path of least _reward</em> rather than trying to guess ahead and hope the best does happen.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
