I am not particularly outgoing, I do not enjoy interacting much, I'm pretty shy, I don't have a lot of experience with social interactions, I'm a rather bad public speaker, and I generally have trouble getting started on projects that need to be started from scratch rather than from existing resources.</p><br><p>You might, I think, object that this is <em>exactly</em> the sort of person you would like on the job as a tech founder! Well, you might be right about the general character of this person. But it still doesn't follow that if I went looking for a job as a tech entrepreneur, I would want to take some of the things written here out of the description, and put them on the application form.</p><br><p>In other words, I'm not necessarily trying to be the sort of person who is best at being a rationalist at a meta level, in the abstract sense that "how good are you at being a rational thinker?" "I think that being rational is fun." And I'm not intending to be the kind of person who, at some future date, looks back and says "you know, I totally could have been a bit more rational", because I had access to my current personality.</p><br><p>I certainly intend to <em>become</em> more rational. But my current goals on this regard involve learning about and getting to know myself better, not necessarily applying the techniques or insights I've learned to my own behavior in particular.  (Or, more reasonably, trying to figure out how I can use the meta-level insights I've developed about rationality, to more effectively change myself into the type of person I <em>want</em> to be).  I'm currently working on figuring this out; this is in direct tension, I think, with the desire to help others by being a rational thought-leader.  (Of course, the two goals are not antithetical. And, importantly, this is something I think is <em>doable</em>, even if it requires tradeoffs, and I have a lot of thinking to do about how to do things this way).  And so that's what I'm working on.</p><br><p>So I encourage you to be clear: I am <em>not</em> working on any sort of personal-identity refactor which will somehow transform my current personality into the desired set of characteristics for a successful tech founder, or make me an actual outgoing extrovert, or give me the confidence I need to start projects I would never have started before. Indeed, I think that's not possible for reasons other than the sheer level of difficulty involved.</p><br><p>Instead, I'm working on becoming a <em>rational thinker in areas relevant to my current life</em>. In areas relevant to this day-to-day rationality, and related to my meta-level rationality on other topics as well.</p><br><p>In my current life, I have a large number of skills, and I like many of these skills more and more as I learn them. And many of those skills seem more and more related to rationality. So learning them <em>not only</em> as skill sets to be picked off or combined into other skills sets, but also as techniques for improving ones rationality in relevant areas is a real opportunity for me to improve at <em>both.</em></p><br><p>If you're asking the question, "What rationality techniques <em>do</em> you need for this day-to day kind of rationalist who is trying to figure out who he or she is, and what they like about this community and what they want to change, and how do they go about it?" -- I <em>don't</em> currently know of any technique that will reliably yield these types of insights as well. But knowing about it and cultivating that awareness, I think, is an important part of the process.</p><br><p>(Note that I am not endorsing any single set of techniques here. Indeed, I like to think of myself as a <em>rationalist</em>, not a "rationalist."  It's just that many of these techniques are more directly applicable for <em>the type of person I am trying to become.</em>)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
