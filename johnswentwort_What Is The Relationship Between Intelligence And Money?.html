The usual arguments I've heard in favor of the claim that IQ is positively correlated with income are roughly:</p><br><ul>
<li>Intelligence improves both IQ and money.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>IQ improves on its own independently of money.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The relationship between IQ and income observed in US population isn't too surprising or informative, but when we break it down into US city, we get much stronger effects.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If intelligence were totally independent of wealth, we might expect to see the relationship between IQ and wealth to look more like the correlation between IQ and income in city populations (no relationship at all) rather than the correlation within city populations (a substantial relationship around the middle).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Intelligence tends to be more conserved than income, so whatever relationship truly exists between intelligence and wealth will be the stronger effect when comparing across populations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Intelligence is fairly stable through one's life (perhaps with minor exceptions, e.g. school, perhaps with larger effect on the later years of life) and stable among individuals; money, on the other hand, depends on a host of changes during one's lifetime.</li>
</ul><br><p>I've found all these arguments <em>somewhat convincing</em>, but none of them quite <em>sufficient</em>. They suggest to me that there's probably <em>something</em> meaningful to the intelligence-income hypothesis, but not "too much", not enough to make one's expected utility skyrocket.</p><br><p><strong>Anthropic Principle</strong></p><br><p>I think Scott Garrabrant's Anthropic principle series goes a ways toward filling this gap. But what is Scott saying, exactly?</p><br><p>The main thing I get from Scott's writing:</p><br><ul>
<li>Some people will be at the tails of the distribution of skills/\xe2\x80\x8btalents/\xe2\x80\x8babilities which become important/\xe2\x80\x8buseful/\xe2\x80\x8bsalient on a large scale.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This means we can expect to find high-impact/\xe2\x80\x8bhigh-impact people/\xe2\x80\x8bpeople with useful/\xe2\x80\x8bsalient skills/\xe2\x80\x8btalents at the tails of a distribution, because such people tend to have a higher chance of becoming influential/\xe2\x80\x8buseful/\xe2\x80\x8bvaluable.</li>
</ul><br><p>...</p><br><p>The problem with the "too much is happening" argument is: most of what is valuable/\xe2\x80\x8bimportant doesn't happen due to high-energy processes, but things happens over time due to (among other things) complex systems containing many details which go out-of-sync.</p><br><p>To explain this: in science, we look at what happens when you make a new combination of molecules. In art, we look at the paintings of great artists. In engineering, we go out and build things with all the parts we've built before, and see what happens. In music, we listen to music from great composers. One reason those things are important is because each of those things happens only once. The chance of that happening is very low. So, we see what happens when we mix molecules together, or hear a piece of music from a great composer, or build something with the parts we've already built.</p><br><p>So, in a sense, we aren't <em>asking</em> for an explanation which explains too much about intelligence and money. We're asking for a theory which predicts that intelligence and money happen mostly due to the same complex-systems.</p><br><p>A few other notes before I move on:</p><br><ul>
<li>It strikes me that this is almost the same question Scott was asking when he asked: given the claim that we observe a correlation between intelligence and wealth across different populations, how big a effect should we expect to see? What <em>specific</em> variables might we predict to see a meaningful effect?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In general, I feel like a high-in-the-tails distribution suggests something similar to the "too much" problem, even if the amount of effect might seem smaller (i.e. the tail won't be as tall). So if intelligence and money are high-in-tails, then one might predict both to become valuable/\xe2\x80\x8bimportant/\xe2\x80\x8bsalient <em>due to a high chance of influence/\xe2\x80\x8bimportance/\xe2\x80\x8bsalience,</em> not just because of the high value itself.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you think of intelligence rather as a large number of complex-systems/\xe2\x80\x8bcomponents, then if you see any one of them have a higher chance (by whatever metric) of having a sufficiently large effect when placed into a new configuration, you can more or less directly infer that the other components <em>will</em> end up with a sufficiently large effect. I do expect most of these to be in some sense "high-impact components"\xe2\x80\x94i.e. components which have a high chance of causing the whole thing to be high-impact. I expect a larger effect from having a bunch of high-impact components and just one which makes a high-impact, even if the latter is much more highly correlated than any of the others.</li>
