<li>Noticing the Bottleneck</li>

<li>Potential ways to resolve the bottleneck</li>
</ul><br><p>Here, I'll talk about self-control and its role in optimizing for long-term goals. Partly because I think it's an interesting question of its own and partly because it clarifies my own thinking. I think the question of how we might resolve the bottleneck on self-control is actually extremely important for understanding long-term personal effectiveness, including in domains that humans <em>want</em> to be good at. (I'll elaborate on this at the end.)</p><br><p>When I was in high school and college, I did a lot of sports.</p><br><p>This worked out well for me in some ways: I got into very good shape, I learned a lot of useful habits, I got good grades, and I learned a ton about myself. However, it was a real struggle for me to stick to my commitments in sports. As I said, sports involves a combination of exercise, learning, and mastery of physical situations. And the most difficult part of all three came together in an unanticipated way: self-control. I didn't understand my problem. It took time for me to grasp it, see its cause, and ultimately solve it.</p><br><p>By analogy with more-general problems, I'm going to call the self-control problem a bottleneck between how well you <em>could</em> learn X <em>from scratch</em> and how well you learn X <em>from existing knowledge</em>. I.e. it's a bottleneck between what you can do and the capacity to do things you already know how to do.</p><br><p>I want to flag that my use of the terms "obstacle" and "bottleneck" here is not meant as an epistemic statement. I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in these areas, and I expect to learn about it pretty quickly. But I want to focus on the core of the problem as I see people I know facing it, which is usually <em>not</em> that they don't want to learn X but just that the default trajectory is to learn X the wrong way. So my use of the terminology is actually a kind of statement about the importance of the bottleneck.</p><br><p>Background</p><br><p>This problem sometimes occurs in <em>both</em> sports and personal life. In one class I studied in university, after finishing all of the assignments I had to grade, I spent my last three days grading them again, because I didn't really understand the assignment and wanted to ensure I got all questions or all answers right. In another class (I don't remember which one), one of the first assignments was for me to find a good, quick answer to a question. (I don't know the answer but was told that the most likely answer was.) In a third class, I failed the assignment because, while it didn't seem all that challenging for me, I didn't actually know how to solve it.</p><br><p>And the bottleneck is not always obvious! That's why I'm making the point that "noticing the bottleneck" is an important step.</p><br><p>The bottleneck can be in any of several places. It's very different in sports and personal life, though, so I'm going to give examples of problems either from sports (which often are easier to understand) or in personal life (which is less intuitive and harder to talk through concretely).</p><br><p>In sports, I sometimes see coaches doing things in the name of a particular outcome. E.g. the coach might have them wear the uniform to better show that they are serious and want to win, or maybe the coach has them do a bunch of running in order to play in better shape before the game or something like that. I think these coaches know on some level that it's not quite the optimal strategy for winning, but they choose it for some other goal anyway. I see this all the time, especially in practice. </p><br><p>(This is a bad case of the planning fallacy. There are other factors working against my understanding the strategy of the coach, and I still don't really understand, but I don't really see where the coach's strategy fits within the landscape of possible training regimens. I expect to have a better understanding of the landscape from the outside if I want to become a coach, and then I can apply what I think is required to win a game.)</p><br><p>On the other hand, in my own life, I also find myself acting optimally in <em>part</em> because of the planning fallacy, i.e. because of how easy it can be to think about a plan until it's time to do it. </p><br><p><strong>Noticing the bottleneck</strong></p><br><p>This problem can usually be solved with experience: you learn by doing, or find ways to do without that bottleneck, and eventually learn to do without that bad-for-you bottleneck. The bottleneck can be a bit of a different problem in different domains.</p><br><p>In sports it can be solved by finding better sources of information. Maybe you can pay someone to evaluate your team, or look at videos of games between two teams from different times. The bottleneck could also be the need to understand everything in detail, which might be better addressed by just learning a bunch about teams/\xe2\x80\x8bsports.</p><br><p>On the personal scale, it can be solved with the sort of planning that I do when learning languages: learn lots of words and sentences, until finally the bottleneck of memory happens and you can learn new nouns every other day.</p><br><p><strong>Potential ways to resolve the bottlnak</strong></p><br><p>I expect there's also a bunch of low-hanger fruit in overcoming the bottleneck. For example:</p><br><ul>
<li>Get enough external feedback that your plan isn't <em>that</em> hard to evaluate. If you are doing something very important and not going to get sufficient feedback, the bottleneck might become obvious. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Focus on more-robust plans. The bottleneck might seem obvious in an easy-to-calculate way but turn out to be very hard to evaluate. So instead of a plan to make lots of money, focus on a plan that is hard to evaluate using some kind of heuristic (like a plan to put in enough effort to be productive for 50 weeks). </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Develop heuristics for evaluating your plans. So that you can look at a plan and say "this seems pretty good" instead of "oh no I've got to do the whole thing". Maybe you can look at someone describing a plan and identify an important bottleneck, or identify a heuristic for predicting how good the plan is (i.e. how many of the important parts it has). Or maybe one could come up with some kind of heuristics or simple model that would give a reasonable forecast, without necessarily needing to fully simulate the plan (e.g. using a rough rule-of-thumb estimate).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Learn some domain. Maybe it's just general good personal habits, maybe it's sports, maybe it's poker. So then you have existing knowledge, and you have an existing heuristic-based plan for overcoming the bottleneck.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p><br><p>I think this <em>can't</em> be used in a few domains. So before going further I want to flag these exceptions:</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Self-improving in domains humans want to be good at </strong></li>
</ul><br><p>In some ways, being good at sports comes pretty naturally to humans. Humans naturally learn physical situations very well. Even people who don't know any math can get good at math. But self-improvement, the sorts of skills that humans want to be really good at, also seem like they have a hard time getting strong external feedback. And most people who want to self-improve are trying to improve in a domain that was very hard to study in school, and have very little experience in that self-improvement domain at a personal level. It makes it harder to identify the bottleneck, even if it's there. So I don't think external feedback is likely to help you much here.</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>Training in domains where the bottleneck does come from </strong></li>
</ul><br><p>If someone is bad at sports because they don't want it, they might still learn to do it the wrong way. They're likely to spend days thinking about how to put the ball through a hoop the right way, and it's not until after they learn all of that is hard, that they start to notice that it's hard to get a pass in basketball either. So in this case, they might just never see a point at which they think "hm, this is a bottleneck in my ability to do basketball things." (It also isn't until after they learn it's hard to do basketball things to recognize it as a bottleneck.)</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>The opposite of the above </strong></li>
</ul><br><p>If someone <em>does</em> have an instinct for recognizing the bottleneck in their own life, it's also possible to have an instinct to not do things because they aren't very important, or to not learn too much about things you're not going to use after you've learned them. This might make it <em>harder</em> for you to notice the bottleneck\xe2\x80\x94but it'll <em>also</em> make it harder for you to solve the <em>wrong</em> way to learn things. So the fact that the bottleneck exists doesn't <em>necessarily</em> imply that it's already been solved.</p><br><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><br><p>Back to the examples of both sports and personal life:</p><br><ul>
<li>In sports, examples include coaches doing the thing I mentioned above: giving their students a bunch of drills to show that they care. E.g., in basketball, running plays over and over. </li>
