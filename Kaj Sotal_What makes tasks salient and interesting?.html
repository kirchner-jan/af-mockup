</ul><br><ul>

</ul><br><ul>
<li>Implications of the Framework for Safety</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Where do I get most of my intuitions about how to define "intentional behaviour"?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How do I know when my ideas on things like agency and "intendedness" are really good? Are they based on my intuitions about what makes tasks interesting or not?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Can the two categories of "task X seems <em>interesting</em>, not <em>difficult</em>" be described in human terms, in the above framework?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are most things interesting?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What kinds of tasks do I find interesting or not? Are there things that we <em>do</em> find <em>too</em> easy, regardless of whether we <em>should</em> find that too easy or not? Are they the kinds of things we should try to avoid or eliminate, or are they things that we should use to enrich our lives?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are the things I find interesting and the things my friends find interesting different?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Can I find things that my friends/\xe2\x80\x8bfriends-of-friends find hard, that I don't find hard?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>One more thought on the distinction between Task and Task-Difficulty</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The framing of task-difficulty as a measure of "how hard the <em>task _seems" doesn't seem to be very useful to humans and I don't quite understand how to describe it in a way where some tasks seem difficult by virtue of being difficult _to me</em>.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Other thoughts</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What do we do about the framing of difficulty in this model?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How should we think about whether and how to define "intellectual interest" or "intellectual effort" or "intellectually challenging?"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Do any of those feel easy, or similar to the concept "task"?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is the relation between Task-Intensity, Task-Salience, and Task-Difficultness?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Is there a task whose difficulty people consider <em>easy</em>, even if they consider it to be difficult in the sense of "I feel pretty bad about how much time I spent on it?"?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>That is, is that something I would consider challenging?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are there things which are both interesting <em>and _difficult, or interesting _and</em> very challenging?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It feels almost like most things <em>aren't</em> task-difficult</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>But are there things that seem to me like they <em>are</em> both difficult <em>and</em> interesting?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Implication for Safe AGI: How much do I worry about an AGI system not being sufficiently capable?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How does this question relate to the framework?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Does my answer change depending on whether I was asking a "how hard will this task be in absolute terms?" question? How hard is "hard?"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are the other things that seem to be both interesting and challenging?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If task-difficulty is a measure of how hard the task seems to me, what is its relationship with other dimensions of importance like task-importance and task-salience?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Is it the case that the things I don't find <em>very</em> difficult still seem like interesting problems to me?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>One thing I would expect to <em>not</em> be the case is if it seems like most of the difficult things in my life are <em>not</em> interesting, and there are just some things that are both challenging <em>and</em> interesting.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(In the former case, this is relevant for thinking about whether I'm getting enough value out of the things I'm currently doing \xe2\x80\x93 see the <em>Other thoughts</em> at the bottom.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It seems relatively less likely to be the case that the best things in life are <em>not _interesting, and there are only some things that are challenging _and</em> meaningful. I would be surprised if that were not the case. I suspect that I'm inclined towards making that judgement because it gives me strong intuitions that what I'm currently doing is more than just necessary.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>One more argument for the importance of the frame of "task vs task-difficulty"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In this model, you <em>shouldn't</em> start with the assumption that things you find difficult are interesting or not, but rather look at what feels salient to you about that question. But I find myself more willing to accept that assumption than I am willing to assume that things I find easy or interesting are any less difficult than they actually are.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The "task vs task difficulty" framing is useful for describing what is most salient to me right now, which is good for deciding what tasks to work on or look into, but it seems to me that it might be at odds with my intuitions about task-importance, agency, and similar concepts.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Could it be that people have internalized this intuition without knowing that they are doing so?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Maybe it felt like <em>really</em> hard things were more important to us as recently as 50 years ago, and we never thought to ask ourselves whether this might change.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Does this sound reasonable?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Could there be a way to re-create the intuition of task-importance in terms of task-difficultty instead of by using the "task vs task"-frame, if it were more useful?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Implies task-difficulty should be independent of one's mood, for example.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It feels like that's true if the task is genuinely interesting, but it's easy to imagine cases where people feel like "tasks that are interesting but hard" would be seen as "boring".</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Is it possible to make task-difficulty independent of task-level importance for people of different moods, by somehow rewinding time and having people actually experience being in a different mood?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The frame of task-difference itself seems useful enough that I think there's plausibly something, at least as a first step.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>That is to say, we can make sense of our intuitions about task difficulty and importance even without the frame, but the usefulness of the frame depends on a lot of details of our world models and of how we draw that map.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I have some ideas how to do so that would make the frame more effective, which I'm posting separately.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If task difficulty is a measure of "How _hard _feels like it is to do this task?" then can it be used to tell us something about the _difficulty _and importance of doing a task?</li>
</ul><br><p>Another post I have on this topic is here.</p><br><p>At the <strong>start of the year</strong>, my friend asked me in a private conversation which posts I most strongly recommend. This is my answer.</p><br><p><em>You can find the list __here__.</em></p><br><p>If you're in need of a motivation to read this post, I strongly recommend reading the whole list of links beforehand. I _don't _recommend reading them all in order.</p><br><p>To start, I'll mention my most important takeaways from those posts.</p><br><p>Types of Salience</p><br><p>I've long had the intuition that there are various different kinds of "saliency" signals in the environment. Here's a simplified version of the main types:</p><br><p>__Physical salience: __a type of salience that things can have independent of anything else in the environment. For example, a chair might be highly salient in an environment only because it was recently dropped in the room, or because some animal might be hiding somewhere in that visual field behind the chair that it thinks may be looking to eat it, whereas a random jumble of other items in the room might be much less salient in that situation. A chair might be salient to you in a new environment because it is very visible, whereas a tiny brown object might be very salient to you in your environment of choice but might not be as salient to the person next to you who is looking for a particular object.</p><br><p>__Actionable salience: __salience that emerges from something about an object, not from any particular environmental context around it. For example, I may move a cup of water across the room from where I'm sitting, or may pick up a small white stick and hold it up before speaking to someone with my other hand. The first action is <em>more salient</em> than the second because it emerges from my intention to do something I can easily control.</p><br><p>__Salient in terms of sensory intensity: __a salience signal that appears only when a thing makes sense in relation to your existing model of the environment. For instance, if you're in a room with a single other person, it may not make sense to talk to the other person very loudly so as to draw their attention, unless that person is the one you want a conversation with. In such a situation you may find it hard to draw attention in some cases because it doesn't make as much sense in relation to the other person's existing model of the world.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
