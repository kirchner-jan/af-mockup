I'm taking a few other courses now, so I want to go a little nuts.</p><br><p>I came across Tyler Cowen's review of a book called The Atlantic's Case Against Education. As with everything Tyler says, it seems worth a read. But it turned out to actually contain some interesting facts. The book is The Atlantic's Case against education. And I will argue with it.</p><br><p>You will not be able to tell where I come down on any of this. I did not read the book in full, but skimmed through the first few chapters. From what I skimmed, I came to the following conclusions:</p><br><ul>
<li>Education probably does not exist at all.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Education has the potential to be a public good, but on average it has a negative effect. The exceptions are a few prestigious colleges (including a few in the elite universities) and high-paying jobs. The benefits largely accrue to those who can afford to go to a high school without the test scores. The average person seems to get a large (and probably slightly overstated) positive effect from the cost being hidden behind a G.I. Bill type of thing, as opposed to paying in money.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The elite colleges do very well on this, the jobs are a lot better too (especially at the top). In fact, the colleges have managed to create extremely prestigious jobs that are more fun to have than average ones, and pay well in money.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There's a big disconnect between (a) what they think the public thinks; (b) what they believe privately about elite colleges; and (c) what they believe about public school.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A lot of them seem to believe that the public approves of schools. In fact, they seem to think that people approve of schools because they believe school is good for people (mysteriously enough, none of <em>their</em> private beliefs match their claim).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The ones who believe <em>other</em> things, like that elite colleges are good for people, tend to either be the same or even more secretive.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>So what's the deal?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They can't reconcile the lack of evidence for effectiveness of public schooling with a variety of private beliefs (of which they include "myself"). They think "why believe that thing if it doesn't have a shred of evidential support?" But the actual reason they can't reconcile the belief that education is good with evidence of its lack turns out to be that they're the same people (or, in some cases, very close to each other and highly interconnected). The common cause, or something like it, is their belief in a "culture of excellence."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>So do they just have a false faith, and are on some kind of cognitive dissonance trip?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Or is it some kind of deliberate deception by people for power?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Actually, they're simply doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They think "education," in the sense of "what they are saying on the page," might be a better term than "school."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It's fine to say "education is an excellent public good." When one says this, we usually also implicitly say "but it probably has some costs so let's worry about that."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If one takes the "education" position, they must admit the benefits of "education" and say "education probably does more good than bad."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They can't do that.</li>
</ul><br><p>My conclusions so far (see first bullet point), plus the "why do they think they're so smart?" (see second bullet point) suggest that we should be suspicious of their claim that education is a public good, unless we can explain why they think that.</p><br><ul>
<li>Their view of public schooling isn't the public school view.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They don't believe you'd be better off without it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They think you're being fooled by some other agenda, such as "we have to give the kids a test."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They find it hard to believe a world where no one likes school and kids like to hate it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Even the things the public likes to like about schools aren't what they truly think.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They look at the public and find people who like it.</li>
</ul><br><p>These lead to _sketchful explanations, _such as:</p><br><ul>
<li>They feel that it is necessary to give the kids some kind of education, lest they turn out like the anti-vaxers (this is what happens when you take the public school view). So they find it difficult to believe that someone can be so naive as to just trust the government to give someone education, without some kind of test or other control mechanism.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They are afraid the government would try to control their education, so instead they try to control the education by controlling the government. Again, the public schools give people what the public wants, so they figure that if the public wants it, it must be good for them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They just see what they are saying on a website or something.</li>
</ul><br><p>I am interested in what people reading this think, but also interested in any thoughts I was missing on this.</p><br><p>__If you have a blog, do you have anything to say about this, or could you explain how you think it all went so far? __What's next?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
