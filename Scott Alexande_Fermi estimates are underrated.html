One particular exam asks questions like "What percent of all marriages end in divorce, before reaching the age of sixty-five?"</p><br><p>According to my actuaries classes, people typically start out married with their husband or wife for life, and then start divorced between the ages of 35 and 55. I figure thirty-five seems like a reasonable estimate, and a little later than the class suggested age twenty-nine. So I answer: 70%</p><br><p>(It also seems like 70% is pretty close to the actual lifetime rate for this question. But I'd guess I could take the actuarial exam at age 21 and still get 70%.)</p><br><p>One of my classmates asks me how old I think I am.</p><br><p>"Thirty-two! That's what my birth certificate says."</p><br><p>"What kind of name is 'Alexander', then?" I'm not sure if this is a joke.</p><br><p>"My name is also Alexander. It's not my birth name, my birth name is Alexander. My birth name is Alexander, but my name isn't that. My birth name was Alexander-Jung, but I'm now Alexander-Lee."</p><br><p>"If you got these exams at twenty-nine and thirty-five, then you're probably an actuary. How old are you?"</p><br><p>"Nineteen."</p><br><p>"Are you working full-time in an actuary office right now?"</p><br><p>"No, the actuaries are too old for that. Only people who're married and have kids get into it at twenty-nine, so I guess I can call myself an actuary. I'm a high school dropout, though. I don't have a job in the profession."</p><br><p>I pause for a second. <em>Wait, if you aren't working right now, if you aren'm not making money, if you have no credential whatsoever, then the best thing you could do right now is give yourself the best possible first name you can imagine?</em></p><br><p>"That seems a little reckless. How old are the actuary classes anyway? Thirty-five looks conservative to me. Maybe thirty-seven?"</p><br><p>"It depends on where you go to school. Our teachers are in the forty-five to fifty-five range, but not in the thirty-seven to forty-one range."</p><br><p>"Okay... forty-five seems pretty conservative to me too, so I'll hold on to the thirty-five answer. I have the actuarium class coming at nineteen, so I can hold on to the nineteen <em>and</em> thirty-five answers, and I can call myself a thirty-five year year old, and make money."</p><br><p>Another classmate nods thoughtfully. "The forty-four year old who passed the exams at nineteen, right?"</p><br><p>"Yup!"</p><br><p>"If he were twenty-nine, would that be in the actuarial profession?"</p><br><p>"Er... sure... I guess it would be?"</p><br><p>"That's exactly what I said! If someone is twenty-nine and passes the exams at nineteen years old, he's an actuary. You don't become actuary until you're twenty-five."</p><br><p>"Why twenty-five, then?"</p><br><p>"Because it was in the class!"</p><br><p><em>Actuary at thirty-five, what is your age?</em></p><br><p>This is the very essence of a Fermi estimate. Let's say I believe two different people when they tell me I'm in my twenties, but I really think one of them must be being a moron. But I know I'm not going to get around to investigating it until I know the truth of the matter. So I decide to assume the second guy is right. What's the least I can do to be pretty sure I'm right?</p><br><p>What would happen if I gave my age as fifty?</p><br><p><em>Actuarial at fifty, what is your year of birth?</em></p><br><p>Aha! I have the truth right in front of me! I'll do fifty minus nineteen years minus twenty-five years minus twenty-four years.</p><br><p><em>Actual year of birth is...</em></p><br><p>The truth!</p><br><p>(if anyone out there is actually considering the possibility that a man my age is a good idea, at least in the case of <em>an actual actual fifty-something year-old</em>, this will be good news, I hope)</p><br><p>It sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? But that's because we're not used to it. When I do stuff like that, I usually think, "This has got to be funny. The person must be insane." But I'm used to that, and I'm used to thinking "This person must know what they're talking about."</p><br><p>But what if there's a good reason for giving yourself a weird age that nobody else knows? What if there's some incredibly useful thing you can do that only someone who's already thirty-four could do?</p><br><p>The other reason that people get into actuaries right out of high school, I think, is it looks like they can have a successful long-term career. One of these classes said that actuaries make over $40,000 at age twenty-nine; the average American makes ~$38,000. If that's true, I'll save about four working years, on top of whatever time being an actuary saves in the long term, which I expect to be more than enough.</p><br><p>For you to be earning even five percent more than you would have had working at a regular job, you have to be an unusually good worker. Which seems plausible, actually: most people have to work at all, and then the people who aren't working have more trouble finding jobs than the people who are working well and have high-paying jobs that don't require experience or much in the way of credentials.</p><br><p>In any case, even when actuaries make less money than someone doing a regular job, they seem to be unusually stable and satisfied with their job. This class had an anecdote about a boy who had been working as a clerk at the insurance company he'd learned the trade of actuarial from, but was miserable and on the verge of quitting, despite making a lot of money; apparently nobody in the office was making him feel better, and he was a bit sad about that. So maybe even if you decide to work in a low-paying job, at least you'll have better coworkers than your age peers?</p><br><p>And besides, you'll get to look back and say that you've made five thousand dollars before you even graduated eighth grade.</p><br><p>Of course I've never actually <em>tried</em> being a fifty-seven year old actuary. But if my first Fermi calculation were incorrect, the second had a much larger impact.</p><br><p>It's not usually these types of Fermi estimates I do, but they feel strangely important. So I've decided to give it a go.</p><br><p>I had originally planned on being 29, and giving my age as 29 seems like a nice neat compromise between actuaries and regular people. I can do it that way if I like, but I think the "actual age" of 25-26 is also a pretty good compromise.</p><br><p>So now I notice I'm getting old. What can I do?</p><br><p>I still want to be an actuary. And I know what actuaria means, with one exception. In college I thought it meant "the class that gets into actuaries". They're <em>not</em> the class you get into; you have to pass the exams, and those are really hard and take years.</p><br><p>The actuarial exams <em>are</em> the class you <em>take</em>, the class <em>about</em> actuaries.</p><br><p>But that's okay, because I also don't know what "actuary" means with respect to this particular exam class. So I still think I'm fine at twenty-nine if I happen to be an actuate.</p><br><p>And even if there <em>were</em> no actuarial exams at age twenty-five, what does that have to do with a twenty-five year old doing the actual thing he's doing? He probably went to college at age twenty-two, and if so it must have been a less rigorous version of the college I went to, but it doesn't seem like he didn't go to college at age seventeen or eighteen or whatever. I have a lot of friends who went to college at a less prestigious college, and not one of them is a year ahead of me or anything, and this would be no different.</p><br><p>There's also the chance that I'm just a moron and the other guy is right. I can't know for sure this time, because he didn't actually tell me my birth name, just say "I'm an actuary" and then give numbers. Maybe the real reason people don't call themselves actuaries until thirty-five is that this is the correct thing for forty-four-year-olds to do. I mean, I don't know, so I'm not sure what to think here.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
