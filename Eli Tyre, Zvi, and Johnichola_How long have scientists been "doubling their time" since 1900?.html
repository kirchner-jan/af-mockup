</ul><br><p>_This post contains math, and may not be accessible if you've been following the sequences closely. The goal is to convey as much of the method and the results as possible, without explaining the math. _</p><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p>For many problems where you know you need to do a lot of work, it's important to not just know that you can solve something\xe2\x80\x94to actually solve it. But when many problems are unsolved and the only data we have is a single isolated phenomenon, it is often easy to tell that the only important information we had was that you can solve this one (and no more) and be confident in how quickly you worked to produce the solution.</p><br><p>I sometimes refer to this phenomenon as the "doubling time"; in other contexts, I usually talk about "amount of work" or "number of insights".</p><br><p>But with regard to actual productivity, you need to put in several "insights": you need to have several bits of knowledge that are relevant to solving the problem. And if you have several bits of relevant knowledge, then it seems a good definition of "insight" that it's that time in which you gain four bits of knowledge.    It seems important to measure time with a fixed reference to some fixed point, so that this doesn't collapse to "all the time you spend understanding things"\xe2\x80\x94we don't want to have to say "no one is having insights right now", except by looking at data about the past.  (Or, "no one spends two months making a detailed model and trying to verify it empirically before gaining an additional bit of insight".) </p><br><p>In this post, I'll try to measure "number of insights per doubling in time" using the time since 1900 in which humanity has been able to develop enough technology to solve a wide, diverse variety of problems\xe2\x80\x94to produce a complete and useful reference class of problems which are solved.</p><br><p>The purpose is not to make some argument about how much the world would be better off if all the problems we <em>don't have</em> are solved in, say, one doubling, or two. The purpose is to measure how quickly we've been getting better at solving problems when we have more relevant data than "is it possible to solve this in one doubling, or what's the number of times I've had to look up the same piece of relevant data in total".</p><br><p>Methods</p><br><p>The simplest method I know of is to look at the time between a human having the key insights themselves, or someone observing them and sharing them.  (The best method I know of for measuring this is the time between two specific people coming to understand a concept using different methods at about the same time.)  The difficulty is that sometimes people will independently come up with the same insights over a long time. So the number of insights can get arbitrarily large.</p><br><p>Another method is to look at when the first person to apply the new insight to a problem. I can also look at what types of problems the first person to understand the insight solves, or try to count down from ten the number of problems solved by the first people to understand <em>the first solution</em>, which gets around this pitfall.</p><br><p>But these methods are not very reliable. It is possible for someone to observe an insight several times over, and the first times they observe it, the insight may not be as strong.  (It's also possible for someone to not have the key insight, but to observe someone else having it a few times and be able to reconstruct it from what they say on subsequent occasions.)  We also may forget the insight entirely over time. Also, I could be overestimating the value of an insight.</p><br><p>These methods also don't give us information about when an insight becomes relevant. If I say for example that the first person to solve a specific problem had a hundred key insights and each key insight took one year, we have no data on what it would have been like if I had counted the hundred one by one, rather than one per year\xe2\x80\x94the first key insight might only be the fourth one. It might have been a lot slower to get the first key insight. Or all the insights might be pretty important\xe2\x80\x94there are three to five problems out there that we can't solve right now, and having even just the fourth would be useful for those problems.</p><br><p>To deal with these issues, I'll introduce a model of insight that is based on a fixed, well-measured parameter.</p><br><p>The main inputs to this model (see Footnote 1) are 1. time, 2. the diversity of different problems solved by different people, 3. the number of generations of insights between the first time some problems are solved and the time after that when some problems are solved by people who knew about them before the first generation, and 4. the amount of time between observations of the insight by different people who know about the problem.</p><br><p>An insight is represented by using the number of insights that someone has had in a time period, as the percentage change to the number of insights per doubling. So instead of saying for example "it took me a hundred times as long to invent a general way to solve a problem", I say "in the last x generations, I solved way more problems than in my first two generations combined".</p><br><p>This means that if there seems to be a lot of variation in how fast human civilization has been able to solve particular problems, that may be because the relevant parameters are off. That means that for many problems, the most relevant information we actually have about the rate of progress on the problem is "In the last x generations I have solved y problems (for some sufficiently large x and y).  How many problems have I solved within the last 10 units of time?"  For some problems, we might get more useful data by talking about what problems have been solved within the last 2 years, or even more recently.</p><br><p>There are also some problems which are much less diverse than others. For example:</p><br><ul>
<li>The first person to create an AGI\xe2\x80\x94that is, the person that created the first AGIs. If we count from the first AGI a few hundred years ago, we should probably use "the world" as the source class.  (See here for a detailed description of the first AGI example.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The first person who figured out how to design an AGI that was not a catastrophe in some sense. It would probably be quite useful to try to measure the diversity of knowledge and problems solved by people in some sense closely related to, or in the same reference class as, the first person who creates an AGI, in terms of how many generations of breakthroughs are between first and first AGI.  (Or perhaps we could just use whichever person first creates an AGI to represent first breakthrough.)</li>
</ul><br><p>Note on the data</p><br><p>I have no reason to believe the growth rate described in this post is wrong, simply because the world has been getting richer and richer over time.  (You can see the graph of world economic output here and here.)  So the world that I'm trying to model here, is a world in which a century from now, we have solved a good fraction of human problems (in the sense that at least one person has a good sense of which solutions are relevant).</p><br><p>The methods I'm using here were made to deal with the kinds of problems we've been able to solve in the past\xe2\x80\x94things like "What is the best way to design an AGIs?".  I chose to measure the rate of progress by looking at how soon we see improvements for problems that have historically already seen improvements. I did this by selecting a reference class of problems, and counting how many times any human had solved any of the problems in the reference class within different intervals of time. I then averaged the log(time per breakthrough) to get the rate of progress</p><br><p>But I don't think the data I ended up using gives <em>exactly</em> the right balance between breadth and depth\xe2\x80\x94there are problems that we have already solved, but don't know how to solve (such as "What is the most important problem and easiest problem to solve with any superintelligent AI?"), and other problems that we have not yet solved, but are in a position from which we expect to solve (such the problem "What is the easiest form to design AGIs in that can be solved by them?").  In other cases, we may have already found a good solution for a problem, but we don't know what it is, enough to know that the problem we're looking at is a good one to have solved in some sense.  (This is the kind of problem that I'll discuss in terms of generating problems that could potentially be solved by superintelligence, because these are the only type of problems mentioned in my definition for insight.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
