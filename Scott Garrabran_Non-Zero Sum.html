It's easy to see when it's true: what two things that I want to spend money on do not compete for money in general.</p><br><p>That doesn't mean that it's always the right frame to view an argument. You sometimes want to frame it instead as a non-zero sum game, or maybe even as a game with a finite resource budget. What are some examples of this?</p><br><p>The most obvious example is money. We each have money, and at any point we can be more and more confident that the thing we want next is going to cost more money than it is. Sometimes what we want is a vacation, and we can be confident that if we take a vacation we can afford it without breaking the bank.</p><br><p>Another example is time. Many things that humans do take a lot of energy, where it seems better to have more energy in the long run. But it doesn't always make sense to view the time you spend playing video games in that light. Yes, you're putting in some effort to work less towards other things. Yes, you might not want to go to the gym if you're still burning so many calories a day. But it's hard not to interpret that as being a trade. You want to spend more time gaming in exchange for giving up on less time spent exercising, or something like that.</p><br><p>The same tradeoff holds true for people. Often, it's more effective for people to help others in turn. One way you can help others is by writing books that help other people, or by building tools. But you could also work on yourself, or at least try to become a better version of yourself. You might also be more likely to succeed at becoming an effective social entrepreneur if you're more effective at social interactions and building rapport with other people.</p><br><p>The thing that makes all these examples interesting is that all these trades must be made in some finite amount of resources. Your vacation could only afford the exact same amount of money if you're 100% certain to not work, so you give up a little to work more instead (though it might also open up new possibilities like being able to work less, or taking a less strenuous vacation).</p><br><p>But here's the thing that makes this concept really interesting. A lot of these trades feel zero sum at first. Why should I give up my time to help others (which also requires me to give up something) instead of doing other things myself? Maybe I want to give up a little more to work hard. Maybe I could benefit just enough from working hard that it would be worth the extra time.</p><br><p>But these are zero sum trades, not zero sum games. In a game of chess, you're giving up something to win something. You can talk about how much a chess match costs to both players for the sake of understanding the game.</p><br><p>But when you talk about a trade being a zero sum game, you've lost some information about what the resources you traded away for were, so you're left with only the resource that you actually valued.</p><br><p>The "zero sum" label is important. Here are just two examples.</p><br><p>Let's say you want to get a lot of people to sign up for cryonics. You have a message that you're putting together. But you want at least X people to sign up. Signing up takes at most Y resources from you. And then you get your message out to Z people, where Y/\xe2\x80\x8bZ = X. So you gain X, and your message to Z people cost you Y+X. It's worth your time to convince Z people, but it costs you more than the resources you receive as a result.</p><br><p>But this is not a zero sum resource trade at all. You could always say that your message to Z cost you no more than Y+X. You put one resource into the bin and another resource comes out. It feels like the resource you put in "lost" is a more meaningful concept here, but that isn't the case. Even if you had 100 people to convince and had resources to get 100 signed up, you still wouldn't have a positive expected net increase. You just gained Z resources and gave away Y resources to the process.</p><br><p>You gain a little bit of resources for the process. Your message takes Y time, your readers took Y time, and you gained Z in time. Everything still comes out exactly right on its own. You were just a little bit smarter about it.</p><br><p>Or let's say that you want to write a book about some subject, and you're looking for an audience. You might have to give up a lot of opportunities where you could have made money by doing things that you thought would be good, but don't care much about making money. What this looks like is that you're giving up X resources to pay for the audience you want (and hence give some value as a result to the book). It's just that there's no way for the value you get as a result to exceed X.</p><br><p>If you give a book away for free, it might only make you a few dollars. It's hard to sell free books. The way rationalists talk about this makes me think the concept is more useful than I realize, so I thought I'd try to explain one more time how it's different from zero sum trade.</p><br><p>Also, for reference, the example of two things that don't compete for money also applies to the non-zero sum framing. What is the best vacation ever will be better than the one you used to go on, but different. So this is an example of the zero sum framing being a slightly off frame.</p><br><p>But then what should you do with it when you're talking with someone about a potential trade that can be zero or non-zero sum? I have two main recommendations:</p><br><p>First, whenever you see someone talk about wanting to give up something to do something else, frame that thing as a trade between two things, not a zero sum game where you have a finite resource budget you're holding out for your thing. There's a lot of value in the context of a trade where the thing you're trying to get or not get isn't zero sum. And if you're interested in the subject being traded, especially if you think it could be positive sum, find some way to talk about that trade.</p><br><p>Second, if you're trying to talk to someone, make sure you know who you're speaking with. I have a strong suspicion that when I talk to a rationalist I could get a lot more out of the conversation this way. It seems like there's an expectation that we all have the same values\xe2\x80\x94that we're all in the same room\xe2\x80\x94but I think that's probably not the case. I have some idea of who I'm talking to, they have some idea of what I'm talking about, and we can all figure out what would be good about talking about it.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
