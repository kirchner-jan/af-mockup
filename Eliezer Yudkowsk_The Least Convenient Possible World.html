Many other physicists (but not the entire field of physicists) realized that reality didn't work like that, it was linear algebra all over again.</p><br><p>I have to wonder whether, <em>if</em> you were told to believe in a "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics, would you still think you needed Special Relativity to protect yourself from faster-than-lightspeed communication?</p><br><p>A <em>lot</em> of other physicists <em>also</em> understand physics doesn't work like that. A lot of them realize that if you take a many-worlds interpretation, one of your world-branches has to contain all the people who know faster-than-laser light works, or, on your own worldview, where is the other photon? But to them, they've made a heroic effort to believe in a coherent Many Worlds\xe2\x80\x94in a world in which a particular outcome contains everyone.</p><br><p>It seems that one of the main ways in which many scientists are distinguished, is the amount of sympathy and respect given to those scientists by others. Even when they disagree with your pet new ideas, they're not <em>considered</em> stupid.</p><br><p>This phenomenon is <em>so completely new</em> to me as to be almost incomprehensible.</p><br><p>In many <em>other</em> sciences, the first stage of the revolution is discovering that reality doesn't work the way you thought it did. The next stage is taking all the theories you've worked so hard on, and saying that the previous idea must be wrong.</p><br><p>In physics there exists an entire generation\xe2\x80\x94or more than one! I would give almost any physicist between five and ten years to reach the level of general acceptance on a concept as weird as "time evolution without change of basis".</p><br><p>Maybe some people, in the field of physics, have enough respect to be allowed to believe that time evolution without change of physical basis is a meaningful description of how the world <em>really physically</em> operates. Maybe some more people believe (I would guess) that a newtonian universe is just the most convenient hypothesis; you shouldn't believe in it more strongly than in Special Relativity, but for a <em>very</em> understandable reason; if you don't understand it, it must not be real.</p><br><p>Why is there no standard response to the objection "But the Many-Worlds interpretation is just plain more convenient than Special Relativity, the other ways of thinking we talked about earlier aren't really real, our universe is just like you said in many ways but just one of those ways is Special Relativity and I'm the type of person who chooses Reality over Belief by default"?</p><br><p>You have to wonder:  Wouldn't you prefer if some standard-sounding standard objection to your belief system came along and made a standard counterargument, a standard reply to it, such that you, if you heard it, would go "Oh" (or in my case, would sigh and say "Oh, yes, well...")?  That way you don't have to get in the habit of having to be so extraordinarily careful when you're thinking about your worldview, and then, in turn, have to give a completely new standard reply to someone who thinks your new concept is the least convenient possible; and then you're back where you started, or even worse.</p><br><p>It's a phenomenon I've noticed in some scientists that one of the things that set them apart, is that they can believe in an elegant new theory of physics\xe2\x80\x94one that fits on the shirt of a man standing on the moon\xe2\x80\x94without worrying too much about whether the theory was invented before or discovered after any other theory, or whether the theory makes predictions on anything but macroscopic decoherence; they know that, in the end, if the theory fits the experimental predictions of any <em>particular</em> experiment, if you follow the laws to the letter, the theory must be correct. But that a single new theory can't be judged based on the elegance with which it fits the data.</p><br><p>So let me reply to one standard objection to the Many-World interpretation of quantum mechanics:  This is "just plain more convenient".  How would we know? Did Reality say so in writing?</p><br><p>How about another standard objection:  "But in every branch of the wavefunction, the Many-World experiment counts half, so it must be 50\xe2\x81\x8450; the Two-World theory is ruled out by the predictions of the Many-World theory, or some such."</p><br><p>You can say that in every other aspect of the universe, except for the <em>one</em> aspect where the amplitude goes <em>up</em> the <em>one</em> component, the <em>one</em> version of reality, and <em>only</em> the <em>one-way</em> amplitude that flows <em>down</em> the wavefunction, which means <em>this</em> wavefunction is exactly <em>exactly</em> half the size of the sum of the other two components and the amplitude goes <em>only</em> from branch to branch the other way.</p><br><p>But, in the <em>only</em> case where you have <em>one-way amplitude flow</em>, can you say that <em>really</em> in every branch you count 50% of the amplitude? If reality was going along with this, wouldn't it have counted 50% in reality, too?  "One-way amplitude flow" could mean anything...</p><br><p>It is <em>not</em> a matter of choosing the simplest hypothesis that fits existing observations. It is not a matter of saying, "One way is a simpler explanation than two," in order to justify a belief in a simple hypothesis. Why is there no standard reply to the objection "My theory is simple <em>because it fits the experimental prediction,</em> it's just not a <em>simple</em> theory <em>in the traditional sense</em>, for it explains a particular experimental outcome" to the objection "The Many-Worlds explanation has to do with many worlds in order to explain the Born rule, but the two-world people have simple theories <em>with no extra postulates</em> that explain why they don't need a Born rule for branches, why they don't have to worry about which world you're in, instead of just being in whichever world comes up\xe2\x80\x94which makes it a much simpler theory <em>in the sense you're using the word'simple'</em>"</p><br><p>In truth, I can't <em>quite</em> see what this objection <em>is</em> supposed to be.</p><br><p>But what I <em>do</em> know is that it's <em>not</em> obvious that many worlds is the theory you should use to <em>explain</em> anything. The "quantum non-realists" who've got a perfectly consistent position in which nothing happens is a real-world <em>solution,</em> but not a solution to the question of why the universe looks like this.</p><br><p>And how many people can say something like that without being considered uneducated or stupid, <em>even for a moment</em>?</p><br><p>So many people believe they have to explain the Born statistics, and <em>only the Born statistics.</em></p><br><p>And what if you could write a computer program that would write every probability as an expression of that program, where that expression contained the Born rule? You could look up the first few digits in the Born rule in the program, and, if you wanted, look it up again in reality. And by thinking <em>purely in terms of that programming language</em>, perhaps you could find a way to compress all experimental outcomes. To explain <em>some</em> facts in terms of other facts, you could say, "I compress these facts into the representation I use to refer to reality, that's all."</p><br><p>And then the question becomes which bits to print out, and which bits to leave out, which bits to print in a certain order.</p><br><p>What if one of the bits had come up a two-boxer, instead of a one-boxer?</p><br><p>Well, that bit must not have been <em>really</em> about quantum physics, but still about the Born statistic. In order to compress, you'd just have to <em>leave some things out</em> that were not <em>actually</em> about quantum physics. Like leaving out the Born statistic...</p><br><p>So when one thinks about how much probability mass they're supposed to put on the Born statistics (which, by the way, is <em>not</em> equal to the Born rule) you end up believing that they themselves are <em>really really</em> physicists, if they themselves aren't Born statisticians. Which is where people go wrong when they think that just because you've got a complex amplitude, it will have a squared modulus.</p><br><p>But you could get rid of that problem just by saying "The Born rule expresses the rule of decision, not the <em>rule of physics;</em> we're just using the Born statistics to make decisions on probability flows."  If you have a computer program that prints out probabilities that happen to agree with the Born statistics, then that's a compression of reality. And that can be <em>reversible at any later time.</em> But it doesn't tell us anything <em>fundamentally</em> qualitative about reality... you can see how much probability you ought to put on "the Born statistics", and then take a closer look at which things are true, which are false, and draw conclusions like that.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
