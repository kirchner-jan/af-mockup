I want to explore this a little further.<strong>Formal logic__Formal logic is defined as systems of __rules</strong>.<strong>Rules</strong> have very concrete meanings:</p><br><ul>
<li>The <strong>rule</strong> "invert any number" is just true on a formal system iff you have a rule to invert positive numbers. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>P</strong> is a <strong>rule</strong> of informal logical connectives if and only if, when someone uses those connectives they apply the rule defined previously. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A __logical sentence __is true to the formal system iff it is a valid application of the rules. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>When trying to be mathematically rigorous, it makes sense define a new formal system to use when a rule is violated: this is <strong>rigor</strong>.</li>
</ul><br><p>Note that this has the advantage of not making any mistakes by default. Thus we have an <strong>irrefutable</strong> formal system: we can't find a contradiction until we want it, and then we will. </p><br><p>When to use formal logic?</p><br><p>In practice formal logic is often used to be precise. When there is a logical contradiction, or a failure of a rule, then the rule is generally violated. For example if someone claims "If a number is even, then it is more than 9" then this is false, so that rule is violated. </p><br><p>If P = "If the number 5 is a positive number, then it is less than 8" then 5 is a positive, 8 is a positive, 5 is less than 8, and therefore we have a contradiction.</p><br><p>In addition, when some process is formalized to run on a robot, if you break the formalization the robot will go insane (and it will be impossible to bring it under control), breaking the formal process of course will not have this effect. </p><br><p>On the other hand, if you want to know if a number is positive you are likely to stick with your brain. It is a formal process made up of <strong>non-mathematical rules</strong>: if we want to use it to understand numbers then the formal process can easily be broken.</p><br><p>Consider the sentence "The number 933789 plus 237983 is at least 80,000." This is false, as 933789, 237983, 80,000, are not numbers to begin with. Is this a bad logical process, or merely an erroneous sentence? You may have to use your rational brain instead of the formal one \xe2\x80\x94 but when you are rational, this is not surprising.</p><br><p>And finally: if we put a robot on Mars and want it to find Earth it is much easier to find Earth by calculating that Mars does not have a surface temperature greater than the one of the earths orbit, and that in this planet humans are found. But we could try and define this formally, and then the robot would find Earth by accident (at the cost of having found Mars, which it could have discovered by other means). </p><br><p>The question "When should the human brain use the formal logic and when should it use the human brain?" has no answer in general. </p><br><p>However, at present day we don't really know much about the human brain. It is not well understood. I think there are two plausible candidates for when it should use the formal logic, and one plausible candidate for when it should trust the brain:</p><br><ul>
<li>Some parts of the human brain can be described informally (analogous to what some of the rules of formal logic have) </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some parts can't\xe2\x80\x94we need to use formal logic in order to deal with them.</li>
</ul><br><p>These are not mutually exclusive; even if part can be described informaly, parts that cannot be described like that can be used in the formal logic.</p><br><p>However, these two candidates have opposite effects on the importance of learning human brain as opposed to learning the formal logic: if formal logic works, which is the case, then "using the formal logic" is important, whereas if we have a good understanding of how minds work and how the brain works, it is no longer important to be able to learn the formal logic. (I think we have not reached this point in practical use of formal logic, so this is a matter of degree, but it exists).</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
