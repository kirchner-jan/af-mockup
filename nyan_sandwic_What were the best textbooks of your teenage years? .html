That's great, but my experience has been that the best source of advice is usually just sitting down and studying the textbook/\xe2\x80\x8btextbook that the professor or lecturer used in class\xe2\x80\x94whether that be a biology textbook or an economics textbook. It is particularly relevant if it is from a subject with which you're relatively unfamiliar; since I knew the material better than most others in class, I found that I got to see the problems for real in practice and could understand the ideas better than most of the other students. Of course, if you are already familiar with the subject it probably isn't that useful, unless the textbook is particularly flawed or the lectures are terrible, which was the case with one economics textbook from my high school in particular.</p><br><p>One of the most valuable pieces of the LW archives is the Sequences, which is essentially the transcript of Eliezer's online blog, where he goes into more depth of all the LW posts he wrote. Even for those who haven't read some of the earlier posts, this is a very worthwhile activity, which is why I started writing about it to people specifically with the intent of encouraging people to read the sequences and get value from them. It took me a long time to finish reading almost all of it (over 5 years), but I still found it a fascinating and useful experience. </p><br><p>One piece of advice I've gotten a lot of mileage from from reading Eliezer's old posts is to keep your notes from a textbook with you at all times. In particular, it has saved me quite a lot of time by letting me figure out specific questions ahead of time, saving time that wouldn't have been necessary if I had just been reading the text.</p><br><p>But the cost to students, teachers, and the general public is immense: the amount of time spent on textbooks, the cost of providing a text book the textbook exists in, and the fact that the vast majority of students don't really take advantage of the benefits of text books. And while there are very few free high school economics courses, there is a very large population of students who get nothing out of all of our schools in general. Textbooks are a huge drain on resources.</p><br><p>I've been thinking recently about why there isn't more of a push to reform the system. And it seems rather related to a previous post where I gave advice that I don't really endorse. Basically, most of the ideas in the comments there were things like using "weird" schedules and "weird" subjects to get students to actually take notes that they'll remember in college. My response was something like "no, what you're suggesting wouldn't work because the student would just ignore them and forget all about it." But on reflection, this seems like the wrong thing for me to be doing. As I said in my comments, I know that I would take those notes, and not just use spaced repetition to remember the content but actually study the material. However, this seems to imply that the majority of other high school students would learn the material, given the incentives of the system.</p><br><p>What I'm asking people here is: are there any interesting examples of students who learned a lot in high school who took their notes and used it to help with their learning in college? Or do you think that the reform needs to be coming from the classroom level, that is, it should depend almost entirely on improving the quality of lessons? And if the latter is the case, why aren't there more attempts at this?</p><br><p>One possible option is to move to an alternative system where the standard high school curriculum is optional, with a similar amount of course credit assigned but where there are fewer requirements in terms of "studying." For example, what happens if we get rid of all of the "essential" classes except for English, Math, and Science? Maybe we could allow students to skip some other "essential" classes like art, gym, or music, and instead give them some extra study time. There is a question as to where this would leave the classes like American Sign Language, which was originally intended to be included to allow students to more easily communicate with each other.</p><br><p>As an aside, I'll mention that I spent a very large amount of the past few years as a computer science student doing really cool things such as writing computer programs in Pascal and C++, and being a student leader in my school's computer science club. This was quite enjoyable, and it didn't seem to be the least bit of a chore; probably in part because I had a job that I enjoyed.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
