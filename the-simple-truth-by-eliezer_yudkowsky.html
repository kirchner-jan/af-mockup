I don't mean to say that you could just snap your fingers and have people start firing off missiles, but that people just went on their programmed "rational" course of action.</p><br><p>Well, I finally heard about the phenomenon of Group Rationality, and it looks like there may be some science to it.</p><br><p>I'm not even sure this is the right place to have the discussion.</p><br><p>There are probably whole books to be written about the phenomenon of group rationality vs the single-thinker fallacy; in which case please go and write one. But I'm not that well-read in the field (not that I intend to criticize others for their ignorance). I'm only interested in the <em>observed</em> phenomenon of Group Rationales going right.</p><br><p>What I've realized recently is that when you read a paper on group rationality, it never states what the <em>simple truth</em> of the situation is. People say, for example, that people are just motivated by conformity and that's why they <em>always</em> go along with group consensus and never go off on their own, ignoring a fact. That's a whole hell of a lot of unnecessary noise to describe what it's really saying.</p><br><p>What is happening? What is the simple truth of the matter of group rationality? What is the most succinct explanation or summary?</p><br><p>You know, in a previous essay in which it was claimed that group rationality could not and never would be demonstrated in the presence of a majority of one? I said, at the time, that you <em>knew</em> the same thing that I knew—that the simple truth, as a simple truth, was much more complicated.</p><br><p>Now, I've been thinking lately about a line of retreat. If you want to explain the <em>actual phenomenon</em> of group rationality, not just the <em>observed phenomenon</em>, you have to start from your observation of actual human beings in the lab.</p><br><p>Which is also, in a sense, the <em>simplest truth</em>—the observation of the simplest thing which could possibly explain something as complex as human irrationality.</p><br><p>Because no part of the equation is as simple as a supercomputer. There's the observation of the actual human behavior. There's the inference of underlying reality which could produce such patterns of human behavior. You can <em>get away</em> with calling that underlying reality "rationality", or "human nature", or what-have-you, in a way that a formal mathematical equation just dutifully "reduces to". </p><br><p>A hypothesis can be made, without violating Bayes' Law, to say:  "There's an underlying reality which could give rise to a behavior pattern labeled 'conform,' or 'group conformity,' and therefore you can infer that reality and not an inference for the observed behavior of people."</p><br><p>But if you're looking for the <em>cause</em> of human behavior—which includes asking under what circumstance a specific human would follow a particular course of action—then we're back in math, and Bayes' Law comes back. Even if you don't have a supercomputer, you can't say that the human action itself is just "reducible to math".  It's something you know <em>because you know</em> reality. It has to be made of <em>qualities</em> and <em>relationships among qualities</em>. There's no point in just adding another _qualifier _on top.</p><br><p>A math <em>hypothesis</em> is one sort of "belief".  A math <em>hypothetical</em> is another sort of "believe".</p><br><p>Now, the Simple Truth is a math hypothetical. It is a <em>relationship</em> between the properties of the observer and the properties of the observed.</p><br><p>You can't be a human being and see Group Rationality and conclude, "There's something going on here."</p><br><p>I would guess that the Simple Truth of the observed human tendency (a group rationality pattern) is this:</p><br><p>You and your friends are divided into two subgroups, A and B, and you're in Group A.  (I will just consider this as a <em>first approximation</em>; don't get confused over the exact structure of the observation.)</p><br><p>Let the two subgroups of Group A be designated "good" and "bad".  Let the two subgroups in Group B be designated "yay" and "boo".</p><br><p>At some moment, some event occurs, in real life. Let the event be defined by the number n, in [1,1000].</p><br><p>Let the true answer for Group A be labeled Xn.</p><br><p>Let the real answer for Group B be Rn, the label which the observers in B give, not knowing how they got that answer.</p><br><p>Let A be that which you are; and B be that which you observe.
Note that there is no way for you to <em>know</em> what the real answer for A is as opposed to knowing how you think the real answer is. We cannot say, "Knowing the true answer, you now believe A is Xn"; we cannot ask your current estimate of Xn to be exactly corrected.</p><br><p>Let B be the observed fact as measured by human beings, which is something like Rn.</p><br><p>The simplest true statement is therefore this:  "Rn is not Xn."  We observe a difference between Rn and Xn, and we infer that there are no human beings, individually, who observe it that way.</p><br><p>So, if we have the <em>observable fact</em>—in the real world, not the model world—that an observation has been made by an individual in Group A, we conclude that he thinks the answer is bad. Which might be true.</p><br><p>If, in some model world where an event like this is possible, we have the <em>true</em> answer A=Xn, we find it surprising that an event like this should have no effect on a human being's answer, so we infer that the human being is <em>not conscious of his answer</em>—as opposed to the model world where A=Xn. Thus, an event like this, _within the model world, _can explain an individual's observation just as well as other possible events like "A=Xn" would.</p><br><p>I cannot find a good diagram which puts the Simple Truth in proper perspective, without putting the complexity in proper perspective. I had to use an exaggerated size-scale to make it simple.</p><br><p>It is a <em>consequence</em> of the Simple Truth that we can observe the following general correlation between observations of reality and events in model worlds—if the model world has <em>no</em> observer who sees the event:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
