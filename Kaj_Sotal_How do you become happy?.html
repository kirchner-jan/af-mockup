You can participate by taking the time to fill in the short survey (it takes less than five minutes). A lot of the questions on the survey have to do with "happiness": they are about what makes you happy, what's important to you regarding your happiness, and so on.</p><br><p>One of the more interesting results, that I've seen around LessWrong, that came up during the discussion is the question of whether one's own happiness is determined by external factors or by internal ones.</p><br><p>One factor that is being controlled is your <em>expectations of happiness</em>. For example, if you expect to be happy and then get unhappy, that has a real effect on how happy you feel. On the other hand, if you <em>over</em>-control your happiness and feel unhappy even after having had positive external circumstances (e.g. a new relationship), that is, if you are <em>unreasonable</em> about your expectations, then that is a real problem \xe2\x80\x93 your expectations are out of control of your actual future experiences, and this shows up in your feelings. (To read a short explanation of this, see this article on akrasia: http://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8blesswrong.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8blw/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8buj/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bakrasia_cure_book_list/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmqy)</p><br><p>However, you probably could find other things that affect your levels of happiness that are outside your control (in particular, see the links at the bottom of the page for links of evidence that a large part of human unhappiness may be due to our <em>reactions to other people</em>, rather than our actions in them; in other words, some of the unhappiness of life may be due to the fact that most of the universe does not happen to be nice to us.)</p><br><p>Still, there are probably things that can be done to improve our happiness levels that require thinking about them \xe2\x80\x93 specifically, it may be beneficial to think about our <em>repercussions on other people</em>, i.e. their reactions, and how we could affect that. (Also, it seems that <em>other people</em> are likely to have their own views on what leads to happiness, so their reaction shouldn't be entirely ignored just because it's not within our control completely. To read a couple of blogposts on this, see here and here, although for your convenience they're also linked in with the main text of this post.)</p><br><p>Another interesting result in the survey is that when it comes to the question of happiness, we seem to have two contradictory and mutually-exclusive intuitions about it: we tend to either think of it as something that is dependent on one's circumstances within a greater context, or as something that is one's own choice.</p><br><p>We also seem to have two different ways of thinking about it. The first one is that in order to be happy, you need to have your life be good. You need to have the things you want and the relationships you have, as well as being in a good general state. The second one is that you need to be happy with your circumstances. In other words, some people think that in order for happiness to be the result of circumstance, they need a certain baseline level of good circumstances in order to be satisfied with how things are. And so if they're not fulfilled in this way, they're not satisfied with their reality, and so must try to improve them, if possible. But some people think that people who are generally satisfied with their circumstances aren't happy. In this case, the happiness can only be achieved by working to improve circumstances, not by being happy with the circumstances as they are.</p><br><p>__A lot of people think that happiness (or, at least, satisfaction) is something one can achieve by working on one's circumstances. At the same time, when you consider the issue of <em>bias</em> \xe2\x80\x93 the tendency to interpret situations in a way that favors the self, and to not notice situations in a way as likely to favor the self \xe2\x80\x93 it seems rather unlikely that this is the sort of thing that is going to make one happy in general._ _Instead, a lot of happiness research seems to point towards the possibility that there really are many different kinds of happiness, and that they are largely independent; and that in order to achieve a certain kind of happiness, one may need to be in certain circumstances.</p><br><p><strong>For example, a great deal of the research on "hedonic adaptation" points towards the conclusion that we have evolved mechanisms to detect whether new things are going into our environment and to adjust our expectations about our future lives, so that we can feel happier than we would be otherwise. </strong>(I can, however, personally testify that in general this system seems to not be as strong as it used to be; there are still a great number of situations where we get a sense that something is wrong, and our expectations for future experiences just don't match up. In contrast, I think when I'm in a more positive mood, I feel as if I could live happily for a much longer period of time.)</p><br><p>An area of research that would probably be interesting to have a read through and discuss is the one on <em>futarchy</em>. Futarchy is the idea of having a government that acts using forecasts, created on a regular basis by experts, about things like national health and national development, based on what the individual members of the public want. (In the example above, the experts would produce a set of forecasts about how certain measures would effect our well-being as individuals, and the government would listen to those forecasts and enact the suggestions that come up in it.) How far away this would be in the future is unclear, but the idea would be that if you were a government minister in a position to shape things in the future, but you knew how it was going to turn out, and your decisions did not affect that, then you could not be said to be "responsible" for things that ended up happening.</p><br><p>My brief understanding of the area points to the belief that you can influence the future only to the extent that you are actually making decisions, rather than just being an observer. So I would not be surprised if there were a strong effect in this way \xe2\x80\x93 the general happiness of our future selves may be strongly influenced by our actions now, but maybe the specifics of our future actions and happiness don't go together all that well? However, if your plan is to become happy, it's probably a good idea for you to start taking an interest in futarchy.</p><br><p>Finally, when it comes to finding out more about these areas, I came across a group of researchers who were already doing some research in the area on their own, and whose methods you can access on their website (not all the papers are available online yet, but the ones that I accessed were interesting).</p><br><p>Another potentially useful result in the survey was the question about "being a happy person". If you expect to become more and more happy over some period of time, and if happiness is a product of a certain set of circumstances, then you must have some expectations for future happiness, and therefore an expectation that there will be some changes in the set of circumstances. In this situation, there is a good reason for your intuition in this area to be somewhat different from someone who just wants happiness with absolute certainty \xe2\x80\x93 even if there is a tendency for our minds to make us think that we have to be happy so that it is in our interest to try to become so, it would seem to hold that some people would have to decide on the basis of expecting their happiness to be influenced and changed, rather than just wanting it. On the other side of the coin, we can also look at evidence that <em>being happy gives you more happiness</em> (see, for example, http://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.scienceofbeinghappy.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bcontent/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b1-the-mechanisms-behind-happiness-is-an-excitement\xe2\x80\x93gulf\xe2\x80\x93anxious-and-content-happiness and http://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww-ccd.usc.edu/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bseer.php) for good evidence that a happy person is more likely to be a happier person in the future.</p><br><p>I'm curious, now, if anyone has further points to offer on these areas, or on other research that may or may not already be available on these topics.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
