It seems to have been quite a controversial proposition. But this claim is not one I have heard recently, so I thought I would look into it. There has been some good writing on this previously, so I will share some links.</p><br><ul>
<li>This is where he goes wrong on the topic of natural selection. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In his introduction, he quotes what seems like a perfectly reasonable statement of what the theory entails, that 'life is a process with a tendency to improve'. The problem is that he is describing the "tendency to improve" as <em>the same thing as</em> a tendency for organisms alive now to <em>impress other living things</em>. He goes on to state that "all living things" are better off in "this or that way". </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This is all completely backwards from how most people talk about natural selection. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Many people speak as if the theory is something akin to_ _the "law of equal and opposite recommendations" applied to a selection process. That is completely wrong. They're talking about the same object while speaking metaphorically, but it doesn't mean that when you have two pieces of a theory, each has two valid interpretations. Each interpretation is valid, but one does not get you the other.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>He then goes on to state, "life is an unguided process, with no direction or purpose beyond surviving and reproducing" This is also wrong. There is still a purpose that is implied through the process of "inclusive genetic fitness", but it gets its meaning through the process of natural selection. It is a very <em>specific goal</em> that is implied when using the word "process". He also gets it wrong when he says "life has no direction", if that's even remotely accurate (I don't have time right now, but I'm sure he gets it wrong elsewhere).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This book is very good when it comes to explaining the evolution and origin of species. It doesn't talk as much about the more controversial topic of human evolution as it does about the evolution of species. </li>
</ul><br><p>He also states, at the beginning, that in his book, he is describing "the current state of knowledge about evolution as we best understand it". This makes it seem as if he's implying that there's nothing more that current state of knowledge, that doesn't need to be understood <em>any</em> better or that there's any knowledge already in it.</p><br><p>His title is "Are You a Solar Deity?". This can be taken as a reference to the phrase "are you an atheist?": you can reject a standard interpretation of the concept of God for something more realistic, more mundane, even though it's still based in the supernatural. The "are you a solar deity" is based in the idea that the purpose of the universe is to create more complexity and intelligence, which implies that there is a goal towards which the universe moves. This, as many have pointed out, is completely incompatible with what we know about the nature and structure of the universe\xe2\x80\x94it's not that God is an alien superforce.</p><br><p>A very, very good book. I would suggest skipping past the beginning, where he explains natural selection, although it is an idea that most people do not understand. Instead I would suggest skipping to the latter part of the book. The argument that some life forms will do better at life if they are more complex is one that is frequently mentioned in this community, and there's some evidence that natural selection <em>does</em> indeed follow this logic. If you want to explore this further, the best and clearest explanation is in <em>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</em>, in the "Dilemmas of complexity" chapter, because the ideas are very simple, and he explains them with the language of cognitive biases.</p><br><p>A large part of the book is dedicated to arguing against the idea that natural selection can be used to make an argument about morality. It is a somewhat controversial topic, but this is the only place where you will run into this argument. In the rest of the book he argues against two opposing claims, but not in order. They are: <em>All the species that exist today are better off, because they are more successful at life</em>, and <em>Some species are better off, even though they are less successful at life</em>. The reason they are less successful is the result of natural selection, but his argument is that these two claims do not imply each other. Let us go through his arguments and see where I think they fail.</p><br><p>Let's first address the first counter-claim: _Some species are __better off, _even though they are less _successful _at life. _In his book he says that to say this, implies that species that are more _successful _at becoming complex are less _useful _at it! He says there is no implication from that statement. I think this is a misreading of the book. He says he is describing what is most accurate today of evolution's results, which is that the more successful species will most likely be more complex. This is completely correct! To give you an example, you could argue that it is a misreading to claim that natural selection results in every new living thing getting to use the ability to move. But this is a completely legitimate argument, especially because it relies on the idea the universe is a system. When he says there is no such implication, he is wrong! In fact I would argue there is a very strong implication here. He has described what he thinks most accurately represents the actual nature of evolution. This is not saying anything untrue, it is describing the process in its most accurate form. It is not necessarily saying that this process is good, it may be completely terrible, but describing it accurately is all that is needed to make this argument!</p><br><p>The next counter-claim: All species that exist today, will be better off, for the reasons stated above. What is most clear about the book is that the existence of a species does not give us any information about its fitness, or its success at life or its intelligence or anything else. There <em>is</em> a correlation between the existing species and their relative fitness (although there may be exceptions), but this does not say that <em>for all _species, those characteristics are the result of natural progression, nor even remotely suggest this! He goes on to argue that "the theory of natural selection is false" but this is a misread of the book, because he states that such a strong claim, _must _all be true. This is a non sequitur fallacy, and a logical fallacy! To be clear, he does state that "the theory has been superseded by modern evolutionary biology", but that does not make the theory true! It means that the theory is true in a modern world, but it could be true in a future one! I don't even understand this part of the book, but maybe what he is saying is that the hypothesis of natural selection not holding, must then be true for the following claim: _all species become better off from the increase in its complexity _due to natural selection. This doesn't follow! I can argue that a theory that is false in the modern world can _still</em> be true for all species in tomorrow's world.</p><br><p>So now we are finally to his true counter-claim:_ We cannot infer anything about a species' utility function, about its cognitive ability, or about its well being, from the structure of its genome. _I agree! To say that structure does give us some information, is more accurate than saying nothing, but the book does go much further.</p><br><p>He starts this chapter by talking about the "Darwinian revolution" and the idea that complexity isn't necessarily better or more valuable than the less complex ones.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The theory of natural selection, which is now one of the most fundamental principles of modern biology, was not born as an isolated fact, but as a consequence of long and complex historical processes. There were many changes during these processes and many more still today, some of them of great significance. But from where I stand now, looking back, the Darwinian revolution is the most important change ever that happened in nature.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This, in my opinion, is completely wrong! There have been many significant changes in evolution, <em>especially</em> the most fundamental ones. There was a fundamental change in evolution as a whole!</p><br><p>Now lets go into his reasoning and see where it fails. He says there is one thing that has never changed, he is being inconsistent:</p><br><p>The one thing that has remained constant since the days of old, is evolution. The ability of life to change at a tremendous rate, the ability to change in response to changes in the environment, has given us amazing biological diversity and, even more important, allowed evolution to adapt to changes in the way we live.</p><br><p>Let me be perfectly clear here. He is not being inconsistent. No one would be able to read the book and come away thinking that! He has just chosen to talk about <em>one _thing that has remained constant in evolution and that is _the</em> <em>ability of evolution to adapt to environmental changes? _If he had simply _described _the evolution of the ability to adapt to change then he would be perfectly consistent. He would say that is the same thing that has remained unchanged! But to say it in two different ways seems to imply that either he is not being consistent, or that there has not been a _fundamental</em> _change _in the ability to adapt. There certainly is.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
