</ul><br><p>I'm in the know</p><br><p>When rationalists want to figure things out, how do they access the information they need if everyone's locked away within small discourse bubbles? </p><br><p>After reading Duncan Sabien's "In the know," I wanted to give this topic a bit more context and figure out what some possible responses to the problem might be (and I bet you already have good ideas!).</p><br><p>I recently learned about Duncan Sabien (aka "ziz") on the Intentional Insights blog. I thought his description was great, and it got me thinking about how I might be failing to see how people in the know are supposed to act. I've had this experience before; I'm sure I'm not alone.</p><br><p>My general thoughts on how "In the know people" operate, and how I might respond to this:</p><br><ul>
<li>In order to participate in the In-the-Know community, you need to show up in the know-in-crowd to signal that you're part of the in-crowd (or that more than one out-group is in-the-know)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The only way you can show up in the in-know is if you show up in the out-know-in.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>But you can't show yourself as an out-know-er (whether or not you believe that's true), so you'll stay out-in-the-know by default</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(If you're an insider and yet wish to signal membership to the out-know crowd, or vice-versa, this dynamic gets a bit tricky. But for now let yourself play along. For the purposes of this piece, "In-the-know" and "out-the-know-in" are short, clear descriptions pointing to people with shared knowledge)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The first line of defence is to signal In-the-Knows that you're an Insider. I think this can be done by, in a "I'm here to help" sort of way, by showing up at things with the purpose of finding the kind of content that everyone on the internet wants to find</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The second line of defence is an In-the-knows sort of approach to the problem of "outs". I guess this would look like asking yourself: <em>Do I believe I'm smarter than my interlocutor? Am I on their side? Is being in-the-known enough to show that I'm at least one of the people who shares their goals?</em> (Note: when I say "you", I'm not talking to "everybody", just the people that I'm thinking of)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It is possible to be both an insider and out-the-kn knows simultaneously, without making yourself a hypocrite, but I don't recommend it or will respond harshly if it's not done right.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"In the know-er" is someone who has a different set of goals and/\xe2\x80\x8bor a different set of skills than you.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If there is no other rationalists in-the-kn-who-you-trust for feedback, the solution for the epistemic rationality problem is obvious: Ask them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It may not always be possible to resolve an in-the-knowledge disagreement to the other person's satisfaction (you're still wrong, but in-the-Knew may be able to point to some relevant skill you lack). They may still be right, and you may still need to learn!</li>
</ul><br><p>In any case, my initial response to the "In the know problem" was: <em>I have no idea how to solve this. Let me think about it. (But I won't.)</em></p><br><p>Then I thought: _There's a good chance this is a good, if difficult problem... It's one of the things I don't understand about society in general, and there are a lot of solutions I don't currently understand but would like to, because there are problems that interest me, but also because of the sort of person I am. _</p><br><p>So here's my tentative plan for responding: A list of problems within a particular community that interest you, that have yet to be solved but that can be solved via a more in-the-loop process. Here are some examples, although the list of problems a rationalist community finds itself lacking in is infinite.</p><br><p>My take on how Duncan's "In the Know" thinking influences the discourse</p><br><p>I had a number of conversations with Duncan about what "In the knowers" would and wouldn't look like. Below are some examples:</p><br><p><strong><em>&gt; 1. Asking an out-the-knower for feedback on a post, on the off-the-cuff basis of whether you agree or not with its content:</em></strong></p><br><p><strong>(I) We're having a conversation based on a different set of assumptions </strong></p><br><p><strong>(II) It sounds like you're expressing a lot of opinion for me to agree with, without having read the post. It's a bad signal-to-noise ratio for people trying to understand a complex and difficult post.</strong></p><br><p><strong>(III) This is "the wrong place, wrong time". </strong></p><br><p><strong>(IV) On the other hand, it's my good friend Paul Crowley's blog, and I will make the proper assumption that a more senior rationalist who has read more of Paul's posts will give good feedback, since in-the-Know Paul is one of our heroes.</strong></p><br><p><strong>2. Asking an In-the -Knows person to provide some context for their perspective, on the off the cuff basis of whether they agree or not with my point of view:</strong></p><br><p><strong>(I). I have this belief that you might be able to make people who are in-the- know more comfortable with AI risks. </strong></p><br><p><strong>(I)'s my own off the cuff response: I'm open to trying, but so far I don't see any reason why I would agree with you, and it wouldn't change how I think about AI Risk anyway.</strong></p><br><p>____(II) As above: It sounds like you believe I'm expressing a lot of my own beliefs, without having read my post. It's bad signal-to -noise ratio for the people trying to understand the core of my thoughts.__</p><br><p><strong>On the first point, the truth is that people who understand the nuances of a blog post will think it sounds a lot like my views. I suspect it's even more likely that they don't take me seriously, because I don't have the social proof that in the past I've been right with similar views, or that I have a good track record of that sort of thing over the last 10-15 years (despite my work at MIRI.)</strong></p><br><p><strong>However, that's one of my motivations for writing this post. If it helps me to convey my views and if other people read this through that lens, then great! Now that my ideas are being shared with other Rationalists, I can see if my views are actually common, and if so I can work on integrating the commonality, and if not I will feel better understanding why that is.</strong></p><br><p><strong>3. Asking an in-the knower about their experience or knowledge, on the off -the- cuff basis of how much they think they know and how good they think they are at communicating:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Well, </strong></p><br><p><strong>-In-the-knower will know that I'm not asking them things that are off-topic. They don't feel a need to say a lot more. Because I'm a person who takes "no comment" as a signal that I'm interested in them sharing their thoughts about the topic I'm interested in.</strong></p><br><p><strong>So in-the- knows-ers have a high default-level of openness and comfortability to expressing their own views, and are comfortable to ask about their knowledge or experience (and to be the kind of person who ask them about such things).</strong></p><br><p>___&gt; 4. Asking someone in-the-knew what their reaction or opinion is to a post, or a problem within the culture, off the cuff: __</p><br><p>__(Not at all uncommon: you see an interesting article written by an insider, and you think to yourself "oh, that's interesting," but you have to force yourself to actually read the article...).</p><br><p><strong>That's not the kind of thing I would normally ask about, but I have a close friend I have been recently working with that I think will have a lot of knowledge about this issue, and I suspect I would benefit greatly from their perspectives, if they're willing to share them.</strong></p><br><p><strong>5. Asking someone who knows more about the issue what they think, on the off of the cuff basis of how they view the issue (or a problem you have had):</strong></p><br><p>Sometimes people I trust will post things, and I don't have time to read every article they write, so I don't and won't always make such an effort. But I may need to, and being an insider in a community that values in-the- knowing is a lot easier than it sounds.</p><br><p><strong>&gt; 6. Asking someone about the in-knowledgeness of a discourse community, off the cuff :</strong></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
