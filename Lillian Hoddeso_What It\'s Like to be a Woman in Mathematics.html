<li>Mathematicians as a Male Birth Control Pill</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Mathematician Women, A Brief History</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Who are the Mathematician Women?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are Mathematician Women Like?</li>
</ul><br><p>In 1991 a survey was sent to all members of the Association for Women in Mathematics to gather information on:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>(a) why they became mathematicians,</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>(b) problems which they encounter,</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>and (c) what they have learned from the problems they encounter.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The responses from over 150 women were compiled in this book by the authors</p><br><ul>
<li>What It's Like To Be A Woman In Mathematics</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>And Why We Are the Few</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Way We Think</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Way Men Think</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Power of Mathematics</li>
</ul><br><p>...</p><br><ul>
<li>"I think that it's an easy thing, if you're just interested in mathematics. People look at women differently in maths than they do in engineering or other subjects. It's difficult for people in maths to imagine that women could be competent in maths. I would say, yes, people are competent, but we're not as good."</li>
</ul><br><blockquote>
<p>"Somebody like me had a talent, but the social skills were non-existent and the problem is that it's not a talent but rather a work ethic."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>It is not by chance that all these surveys were conducted by women; there is a clear bias in who is willing to take the survey. The overwhelming response indicates a distinct perspective from those men who choose to be silent.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>When we look at the survey responses (a), (b) and (c), we see that men and women approach mathematics very differently. Mathematician women generally have much more first-hand experience than mathematically-talented men. They go into engineering and non-mathematical subjects. And they often tell us that they really _like _to do mathematics, because it is just so straightforward, and they have the power and control over the subject for what they want to do it.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>...</p><br><blockquote>
<p>As soon as women go into it (mathematics), they are treated like dogs, they cannot hold down a job, not to mention be anything else in society; they get fired for no other reason than that they are female. This is an absolute fact of life. Because women are in control of their bodies and it's impossible to get rid of a pregnancy or birth pains\xe2\x80\x94for that matter, it's impossible to control how many children you have; and also, it's a fact of life that women cannot hold down a non-menial job. There's no such thing as a woman doing anything in a non-menual profession, there must be men doing it. But if you have the one thing, you are treated like dog. Not all the women of math are this way, but I would say that the vast majority of women in math are as far as people go from being treated well. A few, maybe three or four hundred, are treated like dog; many of the rest are treated as if they were in society somewhere; the vast majority are treated as if their gender were no different from yours and I would say no man is better, not to mention other men, than them.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>... </p><br><blockquote>
<p>You can't be a woman and a mathematician and a homemaker; if you want, then you really have to choose one or the other.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The last words in the book were a bit poetic, so I will put the last piece of poetry:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>What we wish is to become ourselves and stay ourselves. If we are unable to do that, why bother to go on?</p>
</blockquote><br><p><strong>Added 08/\xe2\x80\x8b09/\xe2\x80\x8b17</strong></p><br><p>This piece is interesting because mathematicians are supposed to be people of <em>abstraction</em>\xe2\x80\x94but here we have one of the groups of people where the women seem to be the ones who are most involved in <em>abstraction</em>.  (I have heard people say that "everything is inherently relational but math requires non-relational abstraction")  Maybe it's just all of the math/\xe2\x80\x8bprogramming classes we take?</p><br><p>(Also, all of the mathematicians I really like and am attracted to seem to be people who, although working alone and not as part of civilization, don't really seem to be in <em>contemporary</em> society. The exception to this rule are the women who have been involved with SI.)</p><br><p><strong>Added 10/\xe2\x80\x8b12/\xe2\x80\x8b17</strong></p><br><p>In one of the responses, someone said </p><br><blockquote>
<p>I think it has more to do with the fact that there are only a small number of female mathematicians than with women being non-mathematicians. In other people groups, it's much more common for the women in the group to be non-mathematician.</p>
</blockquote><br><p><strong>Added 06/\xe2\x80\x8b20/\xe2\x80\x8b18</strong></p><br><p>This article, on the "Gentoo Project" on gender diversity in math and computer science by Alexei Andreev says that:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>According to an online survey carried out by Google Surveys it appears that 90.9% of the global population either likes math or wishes it liked math better. A majority of the female mathematicians like math more and more while men like math less and less. A sizable fraction of non-mathematiciarian women like math more and men like math less. The female mathematicians tend to be highly educated, and their non-mathematicinarian friends include a lot of mathematicians' spouses.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>It's not just my impression either: this article claims that the ratio of male to female mathematicians has been going down. I suppose this is sort of a confirmation of what I've read from this survey, although to be fair, the survey is <em>not as random</em> as these articles. In reality, there are probably a whole bunch of <em>un-sampled</em> girls mathematicians out there who are really good at math and just didn't really sign up for the survey. (I wonder if this idea ever gets to Larry Summers?)</p><br><p>So the numbers are just not really representative of the distribution of women and men in mathematics on a wider scale. The data I'm using about <em>men</em> is just a slice from a whole pie (albeit a rather <em>large</em> slice).  If mathematicians could be more like all of the other people in the world, I doubt it would be a problem.</p><br><p><strong>Updated 08/\xe2\x80\x8b11/\xe2\x80\x8b18</strong></p><br><p>Added section about gender composition of SI.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
