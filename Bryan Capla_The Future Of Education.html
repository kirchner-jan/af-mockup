<li>The average IQ is about 160.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The median IQ is about 140.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>About 3% of the population is above 175 on the IQ scale, and a third of the population is below 100. (I didn't know when the ceiling was so high, but I guess it was around 160 when I was a kid, and probably higher now.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>That the average adult is probably about 140, but that's because of the way we test people, not true variation in IQ per se.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Most adults (e.g. a majority of white Americans) probably have an average IQ of about 130.</li>
</ul><br><p>A similar but more impressive result pops up on the subject of conscientiousness:</p><br><p><em>[__Note__: Please be aware of a few other LW posts claiming that average conscientiousness in the US is 100. I checked a few on the site, and most seemed to be cherry-picked. It's a fairly standard result that conscientiousness has dropped by about a third over the past 200 years. For a list of a few more, look here. See also footnote below the article for more on this.]</em></p><br><p>Here were my college-level sources as of 2020:</p><br><ul>
<li>On average, adults are likely 120 IQ and conscientiousness is about 110.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>On average, adult conscientiousness is probably 100, though probably not for very conscientious humans.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Average IQ in 2016 was 160, and probably 150ish now. As of 2020, average IQ in 2021 probably isn't much higher than today.</li>
</ul><br><p>(Here's a brief summary table based on the first article, but with more emphasis on the first row. Note that some of this data is old, in an older time and a different place, and that the last line is an argument that's already obsolete given the last two numbers.)</p><br><p>I think most of my readers (like me) are skeptical of claims like 'IQ is ~150', but perhaps not so much of claims like 'conscientiousness' is on the edge of being 120 \xe2\x80\x93 or maybe some other number is closer to the truth. Here are some of the predictions I'd make if I thought, "What does most of our educated public believe (or pretend to believe) about the future of IQ and conscientiousness? And which numbers are most consistent with predictions about a future of 150?"</p><br><ul>
<li>I'd predict an IQ of 150 (or at about 150) to be the median prediction, with a few outliers at 175.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'd predict that a major factor to driving this shift is cultural shifts, especially the cultural shift to a more STEM-focused world\xe2\x80\x94i.e. a less humanities-inclined version of the above graph that shows an average age of 130, which is closer to reality.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I would additionally predict (with a higher but less certain probability) an age of 130ish to be the median of the graph for conscientiousness.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I could then make some guesses about the effects of increased STEM education, the general 'STEMization' of the university system (see below) and so on.</li>
</ul><br><p>The world is full of things I wish I'd learned about. Here is my list of other topics, some of which have become part of my background, that I wish I'd investigated more thoroughly. Here is my (somewhat self-recommending) list of more recent things I wish I knew more about:</p><br><ul>
<li>What is and isn't known about the genetics of intelligence?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What are the typical correlates and determinants of intelligence? What are the typical differences between high and low cognitive ability?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What factors and mechanisms cause people with lower cognitive ability to act stupidly?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How can the brain be strengthened, rather than improved?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What's up with the mysterious difference between what's correlated with real-world outcomes, and what's correlated with cognitive ability?</li>
</ul><br><p>I'd also appreciate any comments or criticisms; this post is pretty rough.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
