By doing so, I hope to help laymen think about evolutionary biology more clearly, and perhaps spark an explosion of scientific interest in it.</em> </p><br><p>When I talk about evolution, I usually talk about things like:</p><br><ul>
<li>In a universe with nothing but gravity in it, you'd see no new shapes and patterns in the matter, such as trees, mountains, and the like, and nothing would ever change. In a universe with no gravity, you'd have a big sphere but it wouldn't ever expand. But as we have observed empirically and theoretically, gravity does things like prevent galaxies from running apart, and allows planets to form that would in the absence of gravity never have existed. Why does gravity do this? Why does evolution do this? I don't know yet.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The human brain is an example of evolution, it is not merely statistical. What's up with that?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Evolution is a force, but evolution is not like electricity or gravity; if you could rewind time, you could "re-evolve" it? Well what does "re-evolving" mean?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Why should there have been an earlier period with intelligent life, if intelligence requires not having evolved in the first place? I don't think there had to be... we're still here! Is there some kind of special force that caused intelligent life to appear late?</li>
</ul><br><p>I'm working on answers to all of these questions, if you're interested in following me on this you can read my original posts here, here, here, and here (that's the "why" part!), or alternatively I can answer your questions directly.</p><br><p>First.</p><br><p>When I talk to people about "evolution", it has a great many meanings in mind. Many people in the world mean at least six different things by that term, if not more.</p><br><p>I think these meanings can be classified in three categories:</p><br><p><strong>1.</strong> The word "evolution" in the common usage when I use it. This is the word that is common in science and in other discourse about evolution. It's the term that I usually think of when I think of the word. If you think of this as meaning 1, it is true to call it an "answer" to all the questions in the previous three categories. If you think it implies or entails 3, you are correct. If you think 1 and 3, you are also probably correct. If you have some other notion of evolution I want to know what that is.</p><br><p><strong>2.</strong> Evolution is the thing that allows things to change in the universe, allowing all those big mountains, galaxies, planets etc. to have formed all by themselves from dust and hydrogen. This is what evolutionary theory is. If you think category 2, it's not really answering the questions in category 1, though sometimes people argue in the opposite direction, perhaps in part because these are the things we know and think we know best for various reasons!</p><br><p><strong>3.</strong> This is an answer to the big-picture question of why there's not an infinite amount of the kind of stuff things are made of in our universe. If you think a big-picture question is even a real question, you can think of category 3 as answering category 1 as long as you think of category 1 as part of a big-picture understanding of why things exist in the universe at all, and category 2 as answering the question of why you exist at all in the universe.</p><br><p>My goal in this post is to distill category 3 so that it will be possible to explain the big-picture "why" of evolution to a layman in a way which does not assume any knowledge of categories 1 or 2. Here's how I'm thinking it will work:</p><br><p><em>We will first go over all the basic features of the universe, and why none of them suggests a reason there couldn't have been an infinite number of them all at once</em>.</p><br><ol>
<li>The universe is neither expanding nor contracting. The universe is static, neither expanding into the future nor contracting into the infinite future. As Einstein remarked, the universe seems to be a static thing, neither expanding away from us nor contracting towards us in space.</li>
</ol><br><p>This would suggest that the laws of physics are either time-independent (they don't change), or very nearly time-independent and not very precisely static. That probably rules out cosmology theories which would say the universe is accelerating towards a Big Crunch, or that everything is flying apart. Also, that probably rules out theories in string theory which would say the existence of some other "bubble" of higher-dimensional string stuff, or anything else. Note: though the laws of physics seem to be very nearly time-independence, there might be important exceptions or "windows" in the laws of physics where time direction reverses, or perhaps the effects of time direction aren't fully understood yet, or the theory is incomplete and I haven't thought of them.</p><br><p>Theories of the Big Bang are also ruled out, of course. You could try to have a Big Bang, but then you need to add an explanation for the static property of the universe. It isn't like the Big Bang says, "Whatever is causing these expanding things must be causally responsible for creating all these static things." That just doesn't make sense.</p><br><ol>
<li>The universe is very well described by Einsteinian relativity, which makes it extremely well described by Newtonian mechanics as well as Special Relativity and General Relativity in certain limits (i.e. short time scales). So it's a unified physical theory which can describe everything from galaxies to subatomic particles in terms of the same fundamental laws.</li>
</ol><br><p>It's also symmetric under time reversal and rotation of spatial coordinates.</p><br><p>The only asymmetry it allows for is time direction; it is symmetric under reflection (i.e."space parity"), but not under time parity (i.e time reflection) (you can flip time and space without flipping time).</p><br><p>Maybe space parity is really a bunch of additional information we don't understand.</p><br><p>Maybe time parity is really a fundamental physical asymmetry. Something that only applies to one direction of time (space is invariant under time parity, since it makes sense even if reversed). Something that violates Special Relativity at long time scales (i.e it allows time to act as an extra spatial dimension, like the one we have in some theories of gravity) or maybe General Relativity, but does not violate Special Relativity strictly. Something that can't be completely unified with the other aspects of physics. But, maybe time parity is just a more basic version of space parity, which is a consequence of some fundamental physics asymmetry that only applies to time, and some fundamental physics asymmetries probably apply to space too.</p><br><p>If all that is true, space parity means that space must have four dimensions, while time parity means there is one time dimension and three spatial dimensions; and that all mass particles and fields must have intrinsic spin.</p><br><p>Maybe we don't know about time parity.</p><br><p>Maybe time and space are fundamentally distinct types of thing. A kind of "time dimension" and a kind of "space dimension".</p><br><p>Maybe time parity and space parity are really just descriptions of a different way of viewing the same fundamental physics. Time is really the arrow of "temporal evolution" in a 4-dimensional spacetime, and space is the "arrow of spatial evolution" in some 3-dimensional spacetime. Then time parity is a description of the "arrow of temporal evolution" in two different 3-dimensional spacetimes; space parity is a description in the "arrow of space" of two different 4-dimensional spacetimess. And these descriptions can only be made sense of if time is not a spatial thing, because otherwise you have a 4-dimensional space rather than a 3-dimensional space.</p><br><p>Maybe physics is incomplete and I've never thought of those possibilities.</p><br><ol>
<li>All particles have a single spin. There is just some spin I call "electric charge" and it is fundamental and conserved, and there are spin-dependent interactions between any two particles.</li>
</ol><br><p>If you already believe in the existence of spin, category 3 answers category 1: all that happens in the universe is due to the time-independent, static laws of physics. The Big Bang was a very special point in space-time, or rather a very special kind of point-like region or blob-like region in the 4-dimensional spacemanifold we happen to be in. There won't be any more Big Bangs, there will only be other particles in various locations, all the laws of physics being exactly the same everywhere and now and then causing one of them to have a slight change, and a slight expansion of that universe. Nothing like some kind of big bang at all. There's just particles here and there in space, maybe changing a little bit.</p><br><p>I assume (this will become clear later) that any such fluctuations in the laws of our universe will tend to average away after billions of years, and everything will eventually look just like what we see around us. So there will not be any more Big Bangs, there will be other big bangs. There will be very big bangs very far away from us. Maybe very far away in space and time, in some kind of parallel world. What happens in such a Big Bang? I don't really know, but maybe something like this actually happens.</p><br><p>If you think category 3 is right, it answers any possible questions of origin in this way:</p><br><ul>
<li>Why do there exist particles with electric charges? And why are they described by a single spin like the spin I call "quantum number"?</li>
