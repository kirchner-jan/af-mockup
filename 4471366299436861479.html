<p>And this is a huge update in my thinking. A large Flynn effect was predicted by various IQ skeptics before I read the Flynn effect. But this update does mean there was little evidence to refute them. The Flynn Effect wasn't just large: It looked large.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Now I wonder how I'll think about other hypotheses. Is there really a big effect from brain wiring, or from nutrition, or from parenting, or from genes, or is it just a bunch of stuff that correlates with IQ at 0.15, and if so what's the big deal to do with that?</p><br><p>I'm also curious what my fellow economists have thought of this "Flynn effect was overhyped" update. I don't think many of us should update strongly in any direction. I suspect that the economists on here are more inclined to update based on this, but most of them haven't examined the data much.</p><br><p>Here I'd like to summarize my thinking on this subject, but in doing so, I will often take some position that isn't very common among economists. That is, I'd like to look at how different academic economists think about the Flynn effect, as compared to how I think about it.</p><br><p>When I was writing <em>The Flynn Effect And The Rationality Debate</em>, I didn't know that in the last three years the Flynn Effect had turned much less impressive, and I was somewhat taken aback by this fact.</p><br><p>At the time of that post, I concluded:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I've come to believe that all Flynn effect estimates that are not corrected for the fact that IQ scores change over time, are likely to be misleading. The Flynn Effect was indeed large, more than 30 points per decade on average. But that means that the Flynn Effect was at most only half of the <em>average</em> difference between modern US and modern UK IQ scores. That difference was on the order of 15 points per decade, before correction. Thus, the Flynn Effect was about 30−15≈25% of that average, and the Flynn effect was probably the result of a combination of multiple causes that, all added together, were comparable to 25% of the average difference between modern US IQ and modern UK IQ.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The Flynn effect on the other measure seems smaller, perhaps by about 10 points per decade. But in the case of the last three decades, what matters is whether 10 points per decade would be enough to make a statistically significant difference, e.g. a 10% difference on the SAT test, which we know is possible. So, my guess is that the Flynn effect was roughly comparable to 10% of the SAT difference, again before correction for changes in test scores over time.</p><br><p>So I'm fairly confident in concluding that the Flynn effect has been more than twice as large as the average difference between the median US and UK IQ scores, or about 33% of this latter effect, plus or minus 10% depending on how much this latter difference was changed by the Flynn Effect.</p><br><p>I see this as the <em>best</em> estimate of the Flynn effect on IQ. And I think that the Flynn Effect (for IQ) should be given approximately 25% of the credit for the massive IQ difference between modern US citizens and modern British citizens.</p><br><p>But the question remains, what is the size of the Flynn Effect (compared to the average IQ difference between US and UK populations) for other measures of intelligence?</p><br><p>My guess is that the data on this is mixed. What data do the US and UK governments have on school exam scores and SAT scores. At least the numbers for the current generation of students? Let's say we only look at the number of students who have been given the test. How about the number of hours of instruction in reading and math before the age of 16?</p><br><p>I have no idea what the US and UK data would look like on these measures before the Flynn Effect. Are they more or less in the normal range than the results we'd expect given the Flynn Effect? I wonder what the data would look like now before the Flynn Effect? That question doesn't matter much except for people whose primary interest is in the history of IQ scores, but it's always fun to ask and ponder.</p><br><p>Robin's conclusion:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>In short, these results suggest that the Flynn Effect is roughly equivalent in effect to the difference in average intelligence between US and UK scores on the SAT test (15 points). For other measures of intelligence (e.g. reading, math, writing), the Flynn Effect was somewhat smaller (a bit larger before correction for Flynn effect), and was comparable to approximately 10% of the Flynn Effect on SAT scores (i.e. 25% of the SAT/​UK difference).</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Now, what about other explanations for the Flynn Effect? Does it come from improved nutrition, changes in the family structure, or better home schooling practices? I'd say there's a good case to be made, but no one has come as close to that as the above paragraph did to arguing for either nutrition or family structure as likely causes of the Flynn Effect.</p><br><p>I think that Robin's post in the previous paragraph is correct, but I want to add a few clarifications.</p><br><ol>
<li>Robin's conclusion "in short, these results" is a summary, and in hindsight it's wrong because it failed to make two important clarifications. First, Robin took the 15 point difference between the IQs of US and UK populations to be his estimate of the Flynn Effect, based on an earlier estimate of the Flynn's Effect. Yet this 15 point Flynn Effect was arrived at a long time ago. Robin also forgot to say: "Based on these data, you should now think the Flynn Effect was 25% of the 15 point Flynn Effect."</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>Robin's conclusion does make two important clarifying statements:</li>
</ol><br><ul>
<li>An average of the "10% effect before correction and 25% of the effect after correction" is about 33%.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>For these 25% of the Flynn effect, we should add 10% of the differences in home school quality, 10% of the difference in diet, and 10% of the number of years of improved public schooling.</li>
</ul><br><p>1 and 2 agree.</p><br><ol>
<li>To explain the difference in effect between the Flynn Effect and the Flynn Effect 25%, Robin can cite improved nutrition, changes to family structure, or more of the same, e.g., home schooling effects. Each item may explain a significant amount of the difference. But then the difference between these three items and another difference that explains the same fraction (25%) of the difference in average IQ between US and UK is hard to assess.</li>
</ol><br><p>In the interest of making it easier to understand the topic and to have a useful discussion, I'd suggest the following approach:</p><br><ul>
<li>Ignore items 2 and 3 discussed above, and concentrate on explaining differences between 1 and 4.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Compare the numbers of hours of instruction to the number of years in 1 and 4. Also compare home schooling hours to schooling.</li>
