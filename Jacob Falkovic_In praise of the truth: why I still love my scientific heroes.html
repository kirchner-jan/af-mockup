I knew about evolution and dinosaurs and the like. Then my mother read him _The Emperor of All Maladies, _a popular book about cancer by the famous Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, and our family talked about it for a week and a half. My father was a research chemist and my mother a biologist, and they both knew a lot about cancer and the diseases that cancer causes, which I found fascinating. But the thing I found most fascinating was that while cancer was mostly treatable when I was young, it got more and more deadly in some very predictable ways as you grew. I knew about Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other cancers that get worse the more you age, but I didn't realize that they were actually getting better.</p><br><p>The book changed the way I thought about life as well. My mother said they were two years of my life I never got back. There was a day when I would have gotten a kick out of that, but I'm a lot less sad about the world than my twelve-year-old self, and most of the things I learned in the book have stayed with me.</p><br><p>This is the main reason that I'm glad I read and loved Dr. Mukherjee's book, and glad I'm glad that my younger self loved it and didn't hate it. It took a lot of courage to try a new field, especially one as confusing as cancer. I'm glad that it was a popular book, and glad that someone popularized something to me. I was exposed to lots of different things via TV, and I think it's one of the reasons that some of my more unusual beliefs are true. In my pre-Scientific Era of Faith I think most of my friends would have dismissed Dr. Mukherjee as a crazy doctor with an over-empirical approach to cancer. I was the only child in my grade to like the book for whatever reason.</p><br><p>It really mattered. I like watching science documentaries, but I don't like seeing documentaries where I'm in the background. The main problem was that I just didn't think the subjects I was watching were very interesting. I still don't. Dr. Mukherji's science documentaries were fun to watch even more than other scientists, because he makes his scientific career feel personal and relatable. He talks about his brother who died of colon cancer, his parents who had lung cancer, and his friends and colleagues who all got different kinds of cancers. He shares his feelings of sadness and loss, and his pride when he did a great job treating a patient. For someone trained as a research chemist, he has a very emotional connection to his work.</p><br><p>I like biographical documentaries as a form of entertainment, but the science that they showcase also informs me about the world.</p><br><p>I feel differently about this than some other people of my generation. In my Facebook group, I recently had a discussion with a group of mostly 20-something rationalist and transhumanists, where most of them came from the atheist movement and all of them had at one point seriously doubted the existence of God. We weren't able to talk about "God" or "spirituality," because the word "spirituality" was reserved for people who had once been religious. Most of them were quite young, had been raised and still identified as Christian, and many of them had spent at least a year reading and studying the Rationality and Effective Altruism subcultures before leaving the faith.</p><br><p>A large subset of that group was very young, had been brought up as atheists by atheist families and had never set foot in a church. All of them have been raised by atheists and know that no one in their families was religious, and all of them are quite familiar with the Rationality and EAs subcultures. Many of them had never heard of Less Wrong, much less attended a meetup. And yet the word "spiritual" used to be a derogatory slur for them, because they were "not spiritual enough."</p><br><p>Not for the first time, I wish I wasn't an outcast, or had less social ties outside of rationalist and trans-rationalist spaces but not necessarily people who consider themselves religious. The people I hang out with in the Rationalistsphere are all pretty smart and educated people, but some of them are at least as religious as I am! These are the people who have a lot of common ground with my generation and can talk about politics too. Some of them may not have been raised in atheist families, and they are no more interested in having common ground with the group of my generation who got their religious education from the atheist movement instead of through the family.</p><br><p>Some of them will become religious when they grow up, and I will have no choice than to have at least one very cold conversation with them about how I feel about their choice to make their minds up on their own. And not all conversations will be pleasant, and those disagreements might come up often.</p><br><p>And some of them will go on and be friends with those of my generation who were brought up in religious families, and I'll happily accept their friendship. But I'm glad, for even though we're in different communities, we also enjoy having a lot of common interests, and I hope we'll be able to share some intellectual topics too.</p><br><p>That's why I still like thinking of Dr. Siddartha Mukherjee as one of my scientific heroes. He doesn't understand things like religion or politics or history, but he has made interesting discoveries about biology, which the rest of us learn from. He wrote a fascinating book and shared his work with people like me, and it helped me through some part of the process. Not everyone can write a popular book, even a popular book about science, even a book on cancer that was praised by Robert Ainslie, and I'm proud of the fact that Dr. Mukherje made his way to my generation.</p><br><p>So while the actual science of cancer, not to mention actual cancer care, has advanced dramatically, it still has several important problems that Dr. Mukhersjee wanted to tackle. We now have better ways of fighting cancer, but new cancer treatments come with side effects as well. In fact, the more powerful new therapies are the therapies that are most needed to fight cancer, and the side effects of those therapies make the treatments even less effective. We can't always treat patients with everything at once.</p><br><p>So let's not be ashamed of the past, and celebrate those who still want to make progress on the fight against cancer, even if it takes them outside the mainstream.</p><br><p>At some point, the mainstream got tired of it all, and gave up and stopped. And that's ok. We should not allow them to keep telling us "hey, you guys, do some more research and then the treatment will come" without actually doing the research or making the treatment come. But I believe it's worth celebrating those heroes no matter how strange and marginalized their views may be. Because they helped us see that cancer was both a disease and a battle, between the doctors who try to cure it, and the cancer itself, and the people on the verge of dying or of becoming crippled by disease.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
