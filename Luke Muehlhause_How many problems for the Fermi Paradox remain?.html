</ul><br><ul>
<li>2.5. Life can evolve without ancestors (and without planets)</li>
</ul><br><p>Suppose you think the Fermi paradox is unsolved, and you want to find an explanation. So you set to work. I suggest that instead you start with part 1. You learn <em>something</em> about the Fermi, like:</p><br><ul>
<li>It's very hard to find an explanation for the Great Silence without anthropics, and people have looked everywhere. You learn something about the history of astronomy that no one knew before, such as: Astronomers have been looking for alien life <em>in particular places</em> for hundreds of years now, and the only place they've found any signs of life is the Milky Way!</li>
</ul><br><p>Then, as part of solving the Great Silence in general, you might also work on finding a solution to the Fermi. For example, you might learn things like:</p><br><ul>
<li>Other types of life do exist, but it's very unusual.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The world as we know it is very unlikely to be a simulation.</li>
</ul><br><p>If you really want to know, you can work on solving the Fermi in general without finding an explanation for the particular Great Silence. (Some day this might be important.)</p><br><p>If you're thinking this sounds pretty crazy, it's because it is. The Great Silence is a difficult, multilevel problem. The Fermi is one level lower. A multilevel problem is not supposed to be that hard.</p><br><p>But we did solve the Great Silence! It's called the Great Silence, after all!</p><br><p><em>Part 1: Solving (_some</em>) of the remaining puzzles_</p><br><p>OK, well, you might still think you could solve the Great Silence <em>in principle</em>. And maybe you just want to learn something about it so you'll be better prepared to study the other problems.</p><br><p>The Great Silence <em>might</em>, in practice, have a simple explanation. For example, maybe extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth for hundreds of years, and you just haven't noticed it.</p><br><p>It <em>might</em>, maybe, have something to do with our planet being a very unusual place.</p><br><p>It <em>could</em> be that we're in a simulation\xe2\x80\x94but almost certainly not.</p><br><p>That's why humans are the Fermi's most famous species, despite our huge brain volume.</p><br><p>(Or maybe that has something to do with other parts being "bigger". Brain volume has a lot to do with the number of neurons in our central-nervous-system-relative-to-our-body-sizes and body-mass, and perhaps another bit when it comes to cortical volume. (I'm not sure how that translates to brain volume.) Brain size is also related to the type of intelligent life you can support (in evolutionary terms). Anyway, there's much more we can learn about anthropics and the Great Silence before we go down this road.)</p><br><p>Or (or or or... if it's one or another of the above things) you just get the wrong answer from the Great Silence, and then it becomes a new problem. If you'd have found a general solution for the Great Silence, you probably wouldn't need to study anthropics after all.</p><br><p>Anyway, it's possible you might solve the Great Silence without knowing any more than what you learn from part 1. So: <em>It is possible to solve the Great Silence even without knowing any more.</em> Your prior is still the answer, and your posterior will probably be very different.</p><br><p>Here's a bit of anthropic evidence to back this up: The Great Silence (as best as we know it) requires that life needs to come in the same place that we are. If you look at our galaxy, life probably shouldn't come here. If you look through the observable universe, there are billions of stars out there like us\xe2\x80\x94where are they?</p><br><p>That means that if life has come to Earth it was probably very unlikely <em>to be here</em> already. It would be surprising to find us here, especially given that our galaxy has so few other life-forms. But that doesn't mean it had to be extremely unlikely to come here. One way to make this improbability more plausible is if life itself were rare.</p><br><p>Part of the reason we don't see other life is because if we did see other life, we wouldn't be alone. If there are lots of other civilisations in our galaxy that don't see us yet, then the Milky Way won't be able to support more than around 10,000 billion (about 1040) other creatures. If there aren't that many other civilisations, then we might find other civilisations like ourselves, and therefore notice evidence of other life. If we're the first planet life has appeared on, there might be other life on the next planet down the line.</p><br><p>That is, if there are other civilisations like us, you don't want to find that you're the very earliest civilisation. That's one of the keys to the Great Silence.</p><br><p>This requires us to guess that life would spread fast to the stars if it did come to Earth. That's the other key to the Great Silence, which is why Earth is such a lonely island to find life in.</p><br><p><strong>What about extraterrestriALS?</strong> </p><br><p>If the Great Silence turns out not to be explained by intelligence, then we may have to solve the Great Filter. I've already described one part of a general solution to this: That intelligence would have to be a rare kind. But other parts are also critical: Life needs to come in different places from us in the universe, and it needs to be a kind of life that finds those places. It may not make sense to try to explain these things, but it's good to keep them in mind when studying the remaining possibilities.</p><br><p><strong>1.1. The "Great Silence" as explained by anthropics</strong></p><br><p>The Great Silence is often explained by anthropics. The main idea is this: If we don't see any signs of extraterrestrials, that means they only visited Earth a few centuries ago, and if they <em>hadn't _visited Earth we would be in an astronomically unlikely region of phase space. It's a sort of _principle of indifference</em>. If they hadn't visited Earth at all, we would be in a phase of the world that was astronomically unlikely. That's why we don't see them.</p><br><p>We can't directly observe if an alien civilisation visited Earth. So we can't test this using our observations (such as not seeing anything with a large telescope), but can use it to rule out unlikely possibilities and help us make progress on other explanations of the Great Silence. (This assumes that extraterrestrials can't have visited any other planet in the galaxy.)</p><br><p>The anthropic question asks whether we should expect to see the lack of traces of extraterrestriALS coming from a region of phase space that is astronomically small, or whether it is more likely to come from a region of massive space that is astronically vast. If their phase space is small, then we need to explain the absence of any traces of them. </p><br><p>An easy argument: Imagine a phase space of (not necessarily normalisable) density functions for when we are. We could imagine that there are thousands of planets where intelligent life just happens to be born in exactly the right way to form out civilisation. That way there would be no anthropic-like reasoning about whether they are there, and all we would need to do would be to count each of them and call the distribution of numbers found across the phase space in our anthropic region "likely". (If the distribution wasn't normal, the above process couldn't be interpreted as describing the distribution of numbers across the space of density functions.)</p><br><p><strong>1.2. Rare earth</strong></p><br><p>Even if there aren't that <strong>many</strong> planets in that phase space, maybe most of it is not the right kind to support life. You can imagine one or a few small pieces of "the right kind" in that phase space. If you sample from the distribution of these pieces, then you might be at the top of one of the ones that have life in them. You might be Earth.</p><br><p>(I'm using this example because I think it is illustrative and is pretty easy to see the anthropic implications. But the concept could be applied more broadly to some other "small" phenomenon e.g. if our galaxy is not _typical _or is not "on the ball" to have extraterrestrials visiting.)</p><br><p>In general, when you sample from a distribution of variables, you're drawing from a bucket of the same variables as you can sample from, with all the other ones (maybe) already having their own values determined by the distribution you're trying to explain or answer. In this case, "not seeing the traces of extraterrestrils on our planet" is evidence for the other variables having the same value as they "should" have for that hypothetical distribution to be consistent with observations.</p><br><p>(But it's interesting that this only works if the other variables in the bucket are rare enough\xe2\x80\x94more on that next.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
