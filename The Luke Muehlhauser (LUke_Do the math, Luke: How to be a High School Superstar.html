</ul><br><p>(Cross-posted from my blog.)</p><br><p>I can write, I did that before I was in this class (see link above). But I've also seen students who can't write at a high school level, and can't understand why. They don't write at all well, and they don't have anything to say. I've felt guilty for not being one of them. </p><br><p>And then I realized the problem wasn't me. I was good at math and writing before high school; I've just now gotten to the point where I'm good enough at both that my high school has started using my classes for a measure of students' progress. And, even better, they've started calling me a "star" now:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>After receiving a positive response from many students in a recent poll, high school biology teacher Luke Muehlhasler said he has decided to use his students' average grade per year in chemistry as a gauge for his students. "After all," he said, "my students are learning how to think." [...]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>The student body president at Jefferson High School last year saw how much chemistry impacted her students' learning, so she decided to apply it to another subject.</p><br><p>If you think a student with average grades in chemistry might be at the high school level, then I have some good news for you: you're exactly where you need to be.</p><br><p>But why is chemistry a good measure? Because it has low variance in score: basically, the highest and lowest scores you get in the class are likely to be the same, because the class is challenging but not too challenging. This allows a student to take calculus or another class that uses grades as a measure, because her grades in the other class will be lower than her grades in chemistry.</p><br><p>So that's step one: use the power of math.</p><br><p>But what really matters is being <em>fun</em> to learn.</p><br><p>In some ways, you can use this as your advantage. The people who had the highest scores on their tests in the first place likely have the most trouble with all this. The people with the lowest scores on their tests are the ones who would have been most likely to get into the college they went to anyway. The person who scored a low grade (say, D) is probably not a bad student anyway, and probably just needs a different curriculum. So if you want to be better at math, focus your attention on the people who score high, and the problem will probably sort itself out.</p><br><p>But even more important than this is the ability to learn from a textbook as well as from the professor. Chemistry is taught very differently from other classes: we learn it by working through problems. So the real focus of learning is not getting high grades (which might make you a target of grade inflation) or high test scores (which could make students not even care about their grades), but on learning the material.</p><br><p>If you can learn that without flinching, you can work through chemistry (see my posts on that) and get a much higher rate of return than if you focused all your efforts on getting high grades. And with your high rate of return comes the ability to learn and improve at any given chapter: in fact, this is the only way you can improve as quickly with the material.</p><br><ol>
<li>Don't worry too much about grades</li>
</ol><br><p>If you are smart enough to work through the material at high speed, then at least grade-wise, you're already very good.</p><br><p>In grade school, the difference between the lowest and highest rankers among students is enormous: the lowest rankers usually can't read, and the highest rankers tend to be the most smart and motivated. So the highest rankers are probably going to be the people with the highest scores in grade school, and these will be the students who don't really need this class, as long as they can do well in another one.</p><br><p>So the students who are already at the top with respect to grades need to worry about grades less and getting high test scores more. The students who are at the bottom because they're not smart enough but not not stupid either should learn more slowly, concentrate their attention on learning the material, and try to do that without getting low grades.</p><br><ol>
<li>Get good writing exercise</li>
</ol><br><p>At the very least, write down all your ideas whenever you make them, and take them to the English class. Then (as I discuss in this post) you can learn the concepts and then forget about them. As you learn more, your understanding of the material will grow. This alone allows you to improve. As you improve, you'll notice ideas that were always there floating around become clear.</p><br><p>When you do this over a long period of time, it's amazing how much more you understand than when you started, without making any deliberate effort to work through the class.</p><br><p>This way, you can keep a rough outline of what you're learning in your head. That is, you keep the names of the various concepts in your head, and can figure out when you need to go back and study or if you've already studied adequately. As the concept is introduced, you can figure out how new it is, how useful you've found it in other classes so far, and how important it will become in the future.</p><br><p>If your classmates help you with this by writing down ideas too, your understanding will grow more slowly but more surely. They can't just retell to you the important ideas in their heads; they have to do it on paper first, so you have to make a detailed record of the connections between the concepts until their understanding grows. Because the others will be able to help you with this task, they also become invested in your learning even more.</p><br><ol>
<li>Avoid bad teachers </li>
</ol><br><p>It might seem obvious that having bad teachers should be bad news if you're trying to be good at learning. But as I explain in the post linked above, bad teachers can make being good at learning an <em>even worse</em> proposition than it might otherwise be. And they can still have a big impact anyway, because everyone who teaches in a high school environment knows that they are a factor that matters a lot.</p><br><p>Good teachers are very worth the investment in learning time. </p><br><p>Conclusion</p><br><p>These are just the basic ideas of what I have found to be useful and motivating. If you want to learn at a higher level than high school or college, then you won't make much progress unless you focus on the areas I list above. This post is a first step at finding the first item on that list: be a very good writer. Because then you could learn more and better, and take more and better classes, for a much better return than if you were a high school superstar.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
