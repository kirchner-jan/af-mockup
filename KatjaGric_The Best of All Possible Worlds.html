If our topic is the question of whether the best of all possible experiences is a cup of tea, we can say whatever we like about this thought. Even if the best of all available possible cups of tea happens to be a cup of tea you were drinking, the best of all conceivable cups of tea is a cup of <em>your</em> tea. If our topic of choice was the best of all experiences, we could think about whichever experiences are actually taking place in a given moment.</p><br><p>You could try and tell me that the best of all experience is not a specific experience, but 'nothing matters', or 'I will get what I deserve'. But then you have to be a particular kind of selfish. And if you think that no-one can truly tell the difference between the experience of suffering as an unpleasant sensation, to the experience of the same unpleasant sensation with the sense of having done something wrong and punished, then you probably aren't going to be the one doing the telling. You probably won't be right in the world.</p><br><p>Imagine that I'm at, and in control of, a car that's about to go off a cliff. But I am a good driver: I really know how to handle my car. And I am not the sort to drive off a cliff into a river because it looks tempting. I am not even the sort of driver who drives off a cliff into the river because my passengers are screaming as they roll out after me. There is no chance that my passengers will die screaming on my way over the edge. But a little further from the edge, we stop and get out.</p><br><p>And I would think we had all made it. The passengers of the car wouldn't die. We wouldn't all fall down into the river together. We would all be fine, all six of us.</p><br><p>I am a good driver, and that is what I think about. We are going off a cliff. We are all fine. I'm holding our hands, guiding us along the roads, out of the hills and back on to solid ground. I know how to drive this vehicle.</p><br><p>But the other passengers are still in the car. When I look at them, the best possible versions of their faces are those in which they have died screaming, on my way over to the river. If you imagine something that 'works', if you imagine the people in that car being alright. Then the best of all world <em>is</em> the one in which they're alive instead of dead, and I get out of the car and pull them all to safety.</p><br><p>I feel like this 'thought' is the best thing to be at. I feel like everything is great, I am in control, there is not much going wrong in the world, and all the little things that make up an existence feel important. But if something went wrong – if there was a car wreck, or we somehow missed the chance to get off the cliff, even the best of all 'worlds' doesn't feel as good as what <em>could have been</em>. A world where we were safe on the other side of the hill, would have that feeling of _everything was going wrong. _In that world, I would be out of the car, pulling on the handles of the side doors, feeling bad for the passengers.</p><br><p>I think about 'what ifs' like this a lot. And when I do, I start to get nervous. When I was a child, I used to have nightmares. I still sometimes do, with varying levels of frequency. And in childhood I never thought that I had a choice in the matter, but after I grew as much as I did, that wasn't the case any more. Now I think that I can't do anything like what I used to be able to do. The situation is too dangerous.</p><br><p>But I'm still not in control over the situation. I'm still not happy with the ways it might go. And while none of the 'ifs' that I imagine for the future are true, they are all possible: I could do something terrible, something terrible would happen.</p><br><p>What if I could do it differently? What if I could drive that car, but with the right intentions? If my intentions were good, and I was good enough at driving without putting life at risk? Then I would make it to the other side of that hill, pull those people out of the car in as few as three seconds. In the best of all worlds.</p><br><p>I know that I won't be good enough to do that. But I know that my choices affect how many times I ever get to try.</p><br><p>If you don't believe in free will, that my 'best world is the best world' statement is wrong – or if you think that I am always choosing to have 'this experience' – then it follows from there. If you don't care about what happens, then that world is in fact not better than the others. If you don 't believe in the best of all things and everything', that world isn't better than the other, and it isn't any better than that one. The best of all possible things is the worst thing that could happen to us.</p><br><p>When I reflect, it is the thoughts I choose to think which end up at my conscious experience. And it is those thoughts that give me my sense of the world, and the experience of agency in the world. But the world that I want is the best that could have possibly happened, and everything that is going wrong is my failure to choose the world I want.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
