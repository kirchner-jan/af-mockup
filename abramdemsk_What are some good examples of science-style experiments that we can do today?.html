I know the Singularity Institute doesn't do a lot of "labs", but we've always been interested in doing some kind of "scientific" experiments, as well.</p><br><p>We've talked a lot about doing scientific experiments, but it's not my main thing on the agenda. It's just one aspect that seems relevant in general. However I think it's also worth mentioning here. So, I'm looking for any advice people can give on:</p><br><ul>
<li>What <em>do</em> you have in mind in terms of "scientific experiments" to do today? In particular, what kinds of things should be excluded? What kinds of things could get some kind of "science-y" experiment today?  These two questions seem related.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How do you decide if it's something to do today? Is this something where you know right from the beginning that it'd be helpful to find out? That kind of seems like the kind of thing that would be excluded more on the "Sciencey" side of doing science, but I'm not clear on other kinds of things I'm thinking of. These seem important too. So, what are some other categories of things that are or aren't science-friendly?</li>
</ul><br><p>I'm talking here about all sorts of things where you might want some knowledge about what things will happen for a given intervention, or something like that. Maybe you want to make some money to do something that wouldn't have happened anyway, or if the intervention is dangerous. You might want to know how many people will be recruited in the study, for instance. You might want this sort of information for whatever purposes. You might just have interest in things like that.</p><br><p>This seems really related to our "labs" work, so I'm looking more specifically for things we can do with the current Singularity Institute funding. (We don't have any current projects that could be classified as our Labs.)  (This actually might be useful for our Labs project in the future, and I should note that I think something like this is _probably _useful for our lab work today. But, I don't know how to think about it.)</p><br><p>Thanks!</p><br><p>EDIT: For reference, here are some examples of sciencey things we've done at the Singularity Institute in the past, to give some ideas of things to do today:</p><br><ul>
<li>The paperclip debate (and the related debates on the topic of Friendly AI) on the Singularity Institute blog (and elsewhere). This might just be a blog post or two, but it's meant to raise debate on key issues.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The study on how much people donate on the SIAI donor page. This was a study to answer the question of how much are people willing to donate to SIAI?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A webform study to check people's views on cryonics and personal identity. This may have been one of the best studies we ran on any aspect, and it ran for awhile. It took several forms, and asked for both questions and also information about a number of other issues. We've also done a lot of other stuff with LessWrong, since starting Singularity Institute.</li>
