it is the statement which you are responding to! It is a statement about why you are not currently trying hard to kill all humans. To respond to this with some remark about how <em>there is no such thing as friendly AI</em> is merely trying to <em>not notice</em> that an existential crisis is still occurring.</p><br><p>You never, anywhere, <em>ever</em> hear the statement, "And we won't be killed by intelligent AI." Not even once. So long as you hear the claim "Friendly AI is easy", you have probably heard it in the reversed form first.</p><br><p>And yet if you look at the statement "Friendly AI will be easy," I can only repeat back that this is an untrue statement. Friendly AI is not going to be easy. It has to be a <em>lot</em> easier than being friendly in humanspace. If you say, "It is too difficult; we shouldn't try for ourselves," then you haven't even <em>seen</em> the full problem. The question is just, "What can be done in the next week?" and the answer to this is "Not much," because most attempts at Friendly AI get lost in the shuffle between "Too hard" and "Not worth the trouble" and "We shouldn't try".</p><br><p>But it is really true that Friendly AI is too difficult. People are trying and failing at it right now. And in real life, one must solve problems in order. The solution or partial solution of a problem tends not to make that problem go away, unless you happen to be Richard Feynman or some other highly talented genius.</p><br><p>I have yet to hear all the possible things an intelligent AI could do, which would make one optimistic about the solution: not all of them are quite <em>that</em> dangerous, because an intelligent AI would be able to use the resources available to it. There will <em>never be</em> a Friendly AI that solves the problem by <em>merely going out and exterminating all the unfriendly intelligences,</em> as a human solution might be expected to. No, there will always be an <em>easier</em> solution for Friendly AI than going out and exterminate all the unfriendlies. There will always be problems left over after the first solution has been found and the alien species wiped out (at a minimum).</p><br><p>"Don't try to solve Friendly AI," says Eliezer1996 on the old web, "it's too difficult."</p><br><p>This post has been edited several times, to reflect changes from comments, and to cut.
