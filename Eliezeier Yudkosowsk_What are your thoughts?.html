And so it stands to reason that, to many people, "rationality" has always meant the same thing: believing only things that can be proven with certainty, or using a set of axioms; not believing in things that can't be proven, or in anything that can't be seen with the naked eye.</p><br><p>And so it is that\xe2\x80\x94if I may use a term which I learned at summer camps to call this\xe2\x80\x94most of the rationality community thinks in "Bayesians".  This is not always the case, but it is far more common.1</p><br><p>I once spent two months with a group of scientists whose main thesis was that rationality and science had been hijacked by creationists. They even named themselves scientists of religion:  But these scientists had a specific set of beliefs about a specific thing. But what this group really found, I suspect, is that scientists of religion had gotten hijacked by creationists, and that "rationality" was just the thing they'd hijacked.</p><br><p>Of course, the creationists are not the only hijackers of rationality. They even hijacked atheism and atheism, for reasons that aren't hard to understand: Evolution, after all, says atheism is wrong. To anyone with common sense, belief in God is something that you couldn't possibly know for certain any more than you know how many fingers you're wearing when you're not looking at your hand. But that doesn't stop the creationists, who think they could know, <em>a priori</em>.  They have hijacked their own beliefs into something they've <em>chosen</em> to believe, just as other people have hijacked their own morals into something they've chosen to believe, or something I wrote into one of my books.</p><br><p>But to most of the Less Wrong community, Less Wrong stands for the belief in a <em>Bayesian probability theory</em>.</p><br><p>We know there are some people with strong opinions who are not Bayesians. We even have people who are not Bayesian rationalists. But these are rare exceptions. Rationalists are mostly Bayesians:  Even our anti-rationalists <em>believe in Bayes,</em> I think.</p><br><p><strong>And so the Bayesians find it easy to dismiss this entire community\xe2\x80\x94you could even say "hijacked" might be an understatement.</strong> The community stands accused not of failing to believe a proposition with at least a bare minimum level of confidence, but rather of believing things that are absolutely not allowed.</p><br><p>"Well," people ask, "how can we know who has good reason to believe that the Moon will rise on June 23rd, 2007? Isn't it hard to tell <em>a priori</em> which beliefs are valid, and which beliefs are not valid?"</p><br><p>But in fact it is rather easy:  You just observe the beliefs being held by the community; and then, if you like, you go ahead and do some Bayesian updating.</p><br><p>And furthermore, I think it is a good idea for us to be open to some ideas that we don't <em>believe in</em> yet\xe2\x80\x94just as, I think, it was good, in a certain sense, if evolution was presented as a hypothesis to be believed with a certain minimum of confidence, and also, of course, the Earth is moving, and we're living in a country that was settled by Europeans, and so on.</p><br><p>1See Lukeprog, "A Rationality Habits of Mind":  "There are many people out there who believe that you should first have an "a priori" sense of your values and then try to update them based on evidence. There are also people out there who think you should have no "a priori", only a probabilistic sense of your values, which can be updated by evidence."</p><br><p>"And there are also people out here," I said, "who think that our "values" are actually just beliefs we have about ourselves."</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
