<p>My initial reaction was to read your essay as an expression of anger at rationalists who "rationalism"-as-you-see-it that you are one yourself; which might very well be wrong, since you write the essay. If your anger is truly rational anger, rather than anger about the content of the essay itself, that's not what I meant to imply; and your claim that I wrote this as an expression of genuine anger is really quite rude.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Robin was not, I expect, the intended audience; but I was still disturbed by the wording and tone of Robin's above-quoted reply.</p><br><p>A Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the best known social dilemmas; it has appeared frequently in textbooks, and has been applied to economics, sociology, evolutionary theory, and many other places. The prisoner's dilemma is best introduced using the following simple 2×2 matrix:</p><br><p>(a) Defect | (C) Cooperate</p><br><p>(b)Bully | (D) Defect</p><br><p>The classic Prisoner's Dillemma is that of a single, symmetric choice between either "Cooperate" or "Defect." There is no other choice. So why is there so much controversy surrounding it? People are supposed to be rational agents, which shouldn't produce this level of disagreement. After all, it's just math; can you _really _disagree with math?</p><br><p>The problem with this story, of course, is that the real world is not a 2×2 matrix. There are many more players than the above two. The classic Prisoner's dilemma takes only two players; the problem _you _have to solve may contain several.</p><br><p>When you consider more players, then it is perfectly possible to <em>disagree on the outcome,</em> even if everyone cooperated. If you all cooperate and I cooperate, then you both cooperate (C, C). If you both cooperate, you all defect with 50 percent chance (D, D); and if you both defect, you both defect with 50 percent (D, F). Of course, you can't all cooperate; then we'd both cooperate.</p><br><p>So I don't really mean to write an angry post against the rationalists or their theory of rationality. As an ordinary human, I am not that rational. But let me try anyway.  "Rational" is a word with meanings, and people sometimes use a more narrow usage, or a different meaning than I do.</p><br><p>(Or maybe my anger isn't meant to be rational anger, to be against a theory of rationality; it's more personal, a reaction caused by myself and my life experiences. It <em>did</em> start out as a personal reaction, but I believe the argument that follows does generalize, and even more than that, if I ever find out otherwise I'll believe me.)</p><br><p>(You <em>should</em> be able to accept the above mathematically, with a reasonable understanding of Bayesian probability; if anything I've written sounds odd to you, and you haven't yet made a clear connection between the problem and Bayesian probabilities, I recommend the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.)</p><br><p>But Robin, responding to <em>my</em> angry post, seemed to be suggesting that <em>he</em> could only be driven to cooperate if <em>I</em> cooperated. I know Robin very well; Robin's not _that _intelligent, but he knows how to read other people's expressions—</p><br><p>—and now I feel that it is my moral duty to respond, that is if you are still reading this.</p><br><p>My claim that Robin's apparent cooperation doesn't generalize is that there's a deeper structure at work in the 2×2 matrix—in the classic Prisoner's problem—that Robin's apparent cooperation would violate, and that this structure can be extended to n players. If we keep adding players, but also keep being nice and cooperating when nice, then we shall arrive at the True Prisoner's Dine. It will prove to contain no exploitable mutual cooperation... and yet the original "2×2" matrix doesn't prove too helpful, after all.</p><br><p>And if that's not good enough, Robin may prefer my explanation of the underlying _cause _of this deep structure.</p><br><p><strong>You Can Only Cooperate if I Cooperate</strong></p><br><p>In the classic 2×2 matrix, we look at the payoff values (as always, I give the payoff matrix as C-D, (C, C), (D,D)):</p><br><blockquote>
<p>(P(C|C)=10 ), (P(D|D)=20) and (P(C | D) = 20)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Since you always cooperate, it's a good idea to always defect. It maximizes your payoff.</p><br><p>I'm not claiming the Prisoner's Dining Argument is wrong. Just that it's not quite as obvious as it may appear. It's not the obvious thing to look at—the logical truth, the moral norm.</p><br><p>When I cooperate, I am not doing the obvious thing, because <em>you</em> are not going to cooperate when <em>you _cooperate. I'm also not going to cooperate if you cooperate, because _I _know I can't get higher payoff out of cooperating if _you</em> cooperate. It's not a logical truth, but a social fact.</p><br><p>Even as the Prisoner's dilemma can be a game of pure logic, there is an important game theory element in which Robin cooperates in the Prisoner's dilemmas, but I don't. Robin is probably also considering a non-zero chance of getting a higher payoff <em>even if he cooperates.</em> As in, that one is also non-zero, and in the absence of counterfactuals, that one must sum to his personal "expected payoff," which is not quite the same as the expected payoff of any payoff matrix that Robin finds in his mind. In general I don't think that even a superintelligence like Robin will be able to <em>simultaneously</em> figure out all the logical consequences of a situation, all the consequences that depend on its own decision, even if those implications are derived from a model of yourself. There must be some important aspects of the situation that are not being modeled.</p><br><p>The Prisoner's Diling Argument is an important social norm that Robin might follow, perhaps he needs to learn <em>the lesson</em> that others will be unwilling to cooperate as _they _cooperate, as the Prisoner makes his first move.</p><br><p>But if you are playing with Robin against <em>Robin</em>, and Robin knows that you also know that Robin won't cooperate if Robin cooperates, then there is a structure behind Robin's apparent cooperation. And that structure is "The True Prisoner's Prisoner's Dilling Argument" in which Robin and I both cooperate, but in a different _sort _of way than Robin, perhaps because of our different starting positions.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
