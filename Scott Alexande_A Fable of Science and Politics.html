That was when a man came over to the table.</p><br><p>He introduced himself as "Dr. Zany" (an anagram of "God"), and proceeded to introduce an "experiment" of his own:</p><br><p>"I'll pick a random student \xe2\x80\x93 any random one, just to check my theory that students are loyal to their class \xe2\x80\x93 take 'em to the library and get them to write the answer to this equation on their own paper, <em>in _red pencil, and then I'll give them their essay back. And then I'll check, by reading it back to them, that they _did _follow instructions. The theory is that when the students write it in red pencil, their brains will make a little picture of the '=' symbol inside their head, as though they were writing it with their fingers. Then, looking up at the picture, with their brains' _separately</em> working picture-recognition mechanisms, they'll see it and guess the correct answer. Then they'll feel good inside, and I'll know my theory has p-to-one confirmation power! Isn't that a fascinating idea?"</p><br><p>"No," I said. "It's an incredibly stupid idea, with obviously obvious flaws. Even if you somehow got the students not to realize the correct answer would be in red pencil, they would recognize it on reading it that this student wanted to write the picture 'in' rather than 'on' the page, which is _extremely _different from what I said."</p><br><p>"What?" replied Dr. Zany, still looking surprised. "You're not going along with this, are you? I <em>should</em> have expected that, if there's a flaw in my hypothesis, you would point out it."</p><br><p>Indeed, I explained, I was actually rather shocked by such an obvious flaw. "You think you can just take any student who happens to be hanging out at your table in the cafeteria, and _just _test his loyalty by giving him a puzzle and having to guess the answer himself? This is ridiculous. You need to have a control group not given any of the explanation, just told the answer! And it would also be good to have someone take a questionnaire beforehand, to collect data on what their opinions are like."</p><br><p>"I understand," said Dr. Zany. "And I wouldn't _think _to do something like that, because I've been in politics for a long, long time. But I never thought about applying the methods of science and logic to political science."</p><br><p>"Don't worry," I said. I sighed. "I'm going to stop you from doing this."</p><br><p>"How!?" said Dr. Zyn.</p><br><p>"You know how I found out about all this?"</p><br><p>"How?"</p><br><p>"The President of the United States said 'We must pass this bill' or something, and I was trying to figure out whether it meant he thought it was good, or whether it was an applause light or something like that, and I wondered if he didn't have an opinion on the matter. So I asked <em>someone else</em> to make a list of all his comments and see if any of them explicitly endorsed an opinion on abortion. And no President in the history of the country had ever said "I want to promote greater scientific knowledge by telling everyone the facts of the matter. And furthermore, I think it's my own right as a citizen[1] to talk about this whenever I feel like it!"</p><br><p>"I don't care how you got the data," said Dr. Zin. "All I care _wherefore _I want to promote scientific knowledge by telling people the facts of the moral matter."</p><br><p>"Fine. But <em>if _you _did _actually care about scientific knowledge, and _never</em> said that you believed it, then you didn't really care about scientific knowledge when you said you wanted to protect 'the rights of scientists' from 'politically-motivated attack[s]'. So if I find a flaw in your theory that explains that, you lose."</p><br><p>"All right," said Dr. Zhony. But as I stood up to go on my mission, he grabbed me by the collar. "Hey, let me ask you something! I don't think you're trying to do the right thing for the right reasons in the end. I mean, you get paid whether you do anything or not, and you only get paid if people get a paper out of your work \xe2\x80\x93 I'd say that isn't doing the thing for the <em>right _reasons if it was _me</em>. But I still _do _like the way you think, I think you're trying too hard at being rational. And I _do _like teaching people about the way to actually pass policies. I don't want to be _a _politician, I really don't. But you're right, I can't have people in charge who don't care about scientific knowledge."</p><br><p>I sighed and let him go. Then I wandered off back to the bookstore where I was going to return my book.</p><br><p>This story is part of a little blog series called <strong>The Science of Winning at Life</strong>.</p><br><p>We have already established that the scientific method is good for defeating Science-Denialism. The scientific method is also very good for studying and combating <em>pseudoscience</em>.</p><br><p>I was once told by a skeptical religious friend of mine when I pointed out that you could argue "science can't decide" just as easily as "science can't prove it," that "science can't tell us how we should decide" just as much as "science can tell us how to tell someone how to decide."</p><br><p>There was something very true and important about this. Science can give you the <em>mechanistic</em> explanation, to say why a particular brain should be more likely to notice one kind of picture than another, but it can't tell you how to tell someone to be that way. And you won't automatically choose the right brain to begin with, and may even know someone else who has different brain wiring. Science can't just "tell you" that you should be altruistic or nice. You have to try and convince them if it's important enough for them to think you're interesting enough to be worth their trouble. Even if they've never heard of science before, they may still be able to figure that out on some abstract level.</p><br><p>Similarly, the scientific method can give you a mechanistic explanation of the way "we, the people" make decisions, how politicians and journalists are chosen to be their leaders, how they think about various issues and make their judgments, how "us" make decisions that are in some sense right or wrong. It can give you an explanation of <em>why _that happens; once you understand the mechanism, you know where the answer that seems _right</em> is coming from.</p><br><p>But science itself cannot directly tell you "we should be altruistic." _That _you will have to decide for yourself, and the science of decision-making has not been perfected yet.</p><br><p>Or this: Science can give you a technical explanation of how a decision theory works, e.g. how a certain probability-updateless decision theory works (if you can get the person to use it as their decision theory). But this doesn't tell you in any way how to construct a decision theory that will solve the problem for you.</p><br><p>Science _can _tell you, if you want to know, "Here's what some other experts and researchers say about X." But _the answer _has to come from you; the experts can't tell you, nor can Science.</p><br><p>In some cases, this is a very minor problem. For example, one scientist might have an argument that could justify his opinion, but he's wrong, and another scientist might have a counterargument, but he's right. Which one is better? You don't know. But Science knows, because Science tells you "this is the truth." And the only way you can become a truth-seeker and tell Science "no, not really," is if your brain has made up its mind about the argument, and Science already has the answer. Otherwise, it will have to be up to you to study the question, figure out who's right, and decide who's really more right.</p><br><p>And as for "should" in general, science can't give you one. It's the problem of morality that people are really trying to solve, and there have never been any simple mechanistic mechanisms for deciding how you should decide. You want to do the right <em>thing</em>, and you don't know what the right _thing _is, and you're probably going to have to get it wrong anyway!</p><br><p>It's also true that some political beliefs can be deduced as a result of science. Suppose a theory has been proved wrong over and over again, so that the experts are very sure that the theory is false. It's still an error to believe in that theory in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary; but if you've already figured that out on some non-biological level, science can at least tell you which side of the issue was right.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
