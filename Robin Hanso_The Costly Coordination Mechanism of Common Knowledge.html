more discussion in the comments.] </p><br><p>If you want to know what is going to happen next with a new group of people, that is usually much easier to negotiate with individual people, and then the individual people can easily know what will happen, and the rest of us know it too, because...well, there's a way you can say nice things about this part, too, but I'm not going to get into that.</p><br><p>What you can say nice comments about, is the fact that you have to spend <em>more</em> resources to negotiate with people, where common communication channels like phone, email and text become more costly. This is in contrast to the cost of a simple verbal agreement, which most people in most settings just don't bother with, such as an agreement to be in a car or on a bus with someone, because it's a hassle.1</p><br><p>However, common communication like this is the <em>only _way to achieve coordination of a group of people with common goals, without explicit communication, which requires specialized skills. There's no alternative, you'd really just have to have a _huge</em> pre-existing understanding and trust in people's intentions2, and all be on board, so to speak, which happens most of the time, but I think rarer than an observer might think. More discussion here3.</p><br><p>Common communication channels are thus <em>expensive</em> because you have to make them common knowledge and _trust _them when you need to use them to achieve coordination of many people\xe2\x80\x94e.g., a time on a bus or on a plane.</p><br><p>This makes it easy to compare costs\xe2\x80\x94e.g. the cost of a verbal agreement, or a letter to a friend or manager. If you do something costly and trust that it will work out, it's relatively cheap. That's the basic intuition for cost-benefit\xe2\x80\x94things <em>worthwhile</em> require <em>expensive</em> coordination.</p><br><p>This is related but different from how money and other markets work in the world. If I pay you one penny for your car or house, I don't have to trust you will return it if I forget to cancel my subscription or the loan or the mortgage or take out insurance... I can just throw away or lose the envelope with my name on it. In this sense, buying houses/\xe2\x80\x8bcars/\xe2\x80\x8bcars/\xe2\x80\x8bcars might be cheaper than writing friends/\xe2\x80\x8bacquaintances/\xe2\x80\x8bcompanions, and I would have no idea how expensive communication is, relative to house-buying unless I explicitly ask. If I tried it, though (and I have on occasion tried it), it still seems expensive, relative to the car purchases.</p><br><p>What's different about communication, though, is that as a communication mechanism, it <em>should</em> be possible to achieve coordination cheaply, given a high degree of shared understanding! You could have a verbal agreement for a bus trip (which would probably cost less in time and money than any of the people is paying directly for a bus ticket). But is there some way I can write a text, in addition to a verbal agreement, that would let both me and everyone else know that the bus trip is on?</p><br><p>Of course there is! _This post. _That's the whole point of writing such posts as this one4\xe2\x80\x94coordinating what to say and write and when to say it6. You might wonder why not write that post earlier. I will give some answers, but I don't think they are totally satisfying. The reason is because I don't think communication of things worth saying and writing about, should be cheap. Or, for the people who've read some of these posts now, the question would be a bit more interesting or important, since I'm giving away a chance to win prizes for posting well. It's hard to compare the costs! So I'd better be explicit: I am not _selling _communication or coordination tools to everyone. Rather, I think communication is worth writing about and talking about, since only the well known coordination tools cost a lot, not the coordination tools of the kind most people would actually use.</p><br><p>Another reason to wait and post is that sometimes new information comes up that suggests a better model for thinking about communication and coordination tools like this, or other ways communication could go than the standard model I've been sketching.</p><br><p>There's also something special about a blog post. You write something, it's already out there, and everyone knows what it is. (Also, the blog post is already the object that everyone knows what it <em>is!</em>) That's what a blog post is <em>for.</em></p><br><p>I hope this gives some more thought and discussion to a topic I think of often: communication is expensive\xe2\x80\x94there tends to be a huge coordination cost for things worth wanting, things worth saying, doing, and trying to do. Why do we do this? Why is communicating common knowledge and expensive and hard and so-forth?</p><br><p>In part I'll cover communication costs in general, as background, then I'll talk about the costs of common knowledge in particular. The common knowledge in particular is just something to do with coordination, and it seems related to this other-optimizing bias, since it's like the cost of a coordination cost, the cost of a communication and coordination cost, something which costs a lot relative to its pay-off, a coordination cost.</p><br><p><strong>1.</strong> The cost per hour of talking or writing, or even the time spent looking things up (e.g. on the internet), can make them hard to do more often in a way that reduces the <em>cost of communication _as an efficient communication form, as opposed to the _price</em> of the communication, as the main component of the cost-benefit. More on communication costs here.</p><br><p><strong>2.</strong> I'm interested in how people feel when their partner says "I won't do that"\xe2\x80\x94does it feel like the idea has been understood and agreed upon, and now needs to be implemented? </p><br><p><strong>3.</strong> The post is a way of _defining _common knowledge, and showing what it is, that I believe people have more of.</p><br><p><strong>4.</strong> I'm assuming the people taking the bus will have already known about these posts about communication and coordination costs, while this post was being prepared, and it is probably possible, by default, for me to write up any other way I want to explain the topic and what would be common knowledge in that sense. I can of course link to posts that explain it the other way, if people ask (or if I write up the question more explicitly). But generally people can figure things out for themselves, and if they really want an explanation, they can just ask, or just take the post to be as an explanation that helps answer people's own questions.</p><br><p><strong>5.</strong> My goal with this sort of post is basically to write up my understanding of communication and common knowledge, and offer it as an explanation for at least a subset of readers, so that other people can be on board with trying to coordinate and communicate more, on a higher level, using tools (previously written posts) that people have used successfully to coordinate themselves and each other, as part of some shared goal.</p><br><p><strong>6.</strong> One way in which some of the tools might be cheaper or more valuable, is because of coordination <em>to do something in particular</em>. Thus, "write at least one post per week" might be a better heuristic than saying "write at least two words per week".</p><br><p><strong>7.</strong> One of the <em>costs</em> of posting to a blog is that readers have an incentive to skip the parts of a blog post they don't care about and jump to the next post. In this way people learn at their own pace. This may not apply to most people, since I'm assuming you were going to read my post anyway. In any case, you can give people a chance to skip to the next section if you think it's something they don't care to read or aren't interested in.</p><br><p><strong>8.</strong> I wrote it here to get feedback and discussion. I think the basic point gets across (that communication is expensive, that we have special reasons to value common knowledge and trust, etc.), so let's try to figure out what are the points people think are missing, or should be made in more or different ways than I've already written here.</p><br><p><em>Update:</em> After taking some suggested replies to this post in the comments below, I've found it helpful, in thinking about different communication modes, to try <em>visualizing or sketching</em> coordination mechanisms I expect to be common in certain situations (some are already in the list below). Then I can compare to <em>visualize _the costs, for the cost-benefit, of different modes of communication, in ways I expect to be _overly-generous in judging the costs</em> (not just comparing to actual communication costs I know about). The visualizations will be more specific than what I've written about here, to be specific. In the visualizations, I'll put up a bunch of examples (with varying levels of cooperation among them) and <em>ask for your thoughts and reactions</em> to whether or not these represent the "norm" where coordination happens or how it happens, for different norms. </p><br><p>And my thanks in advance to anyone who reads this and wants to suggest or share a visualization, or who wants to respond to this post by proposing/\xe2\x80\x8bcritiquing the "visualizations", which I'd especially like to draw the attention of non-English speakers (sorry!)</p><br><p><strong>Visualizations:</strong></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
