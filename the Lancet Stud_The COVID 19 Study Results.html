</ul><br><p><em>I have cross-posted the __article version__ with some minor edits from __LessWrong__ here, and have updated this to be more up to date with the current paper version. This is something I wrote to be clear on what I am writing: it looks like most of LessWrong missed this or missed recent post on the same subject.</em></p><br><p>The UK Biobank is a study where 40,000 middle-aged British subjects have their physical and mental health tracked over many years.</p><br><p>It was found that women have slightly worse outcomes than men, with men making fewer major health decisions, even though they get more medical treatment and have slightly worse health outcomes in the short term.</p><br><p>This study wasn't a control group. It doesn't do randomized controlled trials. The sample consists of 40,000 people, but most of them participated in one study only. (Only 10k signed up for this study, only 6k people in total took on the project so far, 2k were lost, and there wasn't enough money to finish those 2k people.)  </p><br><p>Their study design does allow for randomization of people to the intervention and control groups (it is a "quasi-randomized study") and they did randomize based on a lottery. This design is one that often has worse outcomes due to regression to the mean and confounding, but it <em>does</em> provide a way to evaluate the claims made in the study. </p><br><p>I am mostly interested in finding out what we can learn from this study, and figuring out what implications this information has for personal life and public policy.  </p><br><p>Below I briefly describe each of the six components of the study, and break that down into their impact on personal life implications.</p><br><p>The Covid Tracking Project dataset which provided these information is not great, but I have been able to get some additional insights by integrating with their dataset. I'm happy to break down this further but it was easier for me to write it as is. </p><br><p>What are the key facts about this study?</p><br><p>Let's just recap the key findings:</p><br><p>The key claim is that women have slightly better <em>cumulative _health outcomes than men, but men's _chronic _health outcomes are about equally good, and _short and long term</em> outcomes are about equally bad for men and women.</p><br><p><strong>The key study findings for you:</strong></p><br><p>This article is about the <em>short-term health effects</em>. But why did I focus on those instead of looking at the _cumulative _effects of the long-term risks of COVID?</p><br><p>In a comment in this post, John_Maxwell says: </p><br><blockquote>
<p>The long-term effects of COVID are the big win that everyone should talk about, but the short-term effects of the lockdown probably dominated the news for a few reasons. First it has a huge psychological component ("are you not afraid?"), and people aren't in general too good of statisticians so anything with a measure of impact has a higher share of attention. Second, it's something everyone can experience (the other big thing that can't be measured) and there will be lots of social pressure to experience that impact even if it's a small amount. Finally it's something that can be judged in a relatively short period of time, and also can actually be measured. In contrast, COVID-related long-term effects may still happen for everyone and may still be large, but they may be too long term or too hard to measure.</p>
</blockquote><br><p><strong>How can you tell whether this will make a difference in your own life?</strong></p><br><p><strong>The key takeaways from this study:</strong></p><br><p><strong>How does this relate to you?</strong></p><br><ul>
<li><strong>There seems to be a gender gap in the impact of COVID. For those of you who do not live with people of the opposite sex, let's use the word "sex" as a placeholder for "sex" or "gender". __Women (or women and men collectively) tend to do better in some of the long-run positive health impacts of COVID: the cumulative health impacts where we see better outcomes than men.</strong></li>
</ul><br><p>\xe2\x80\x93 What does this imply for you personally?</p><br><p>A better model of the world is necessary in order to figure out how to best act in the context of this uncertainty and uncertainty that the future will bring. If you do not live with a person of the opposite sex nor ever intend to, this does not seem to change the fact that in order to have a good life and minimize negative impacts I think you really do need to choose whether you live with someone of the same sex or not, and whether you plan on having children \xe2\x80\x93 children tend to be good for the family system.</p><br><p><strong>For those who do live with someone of either sex:</strong></p><br><p>To reduce the number of hours you spend together with someone of either type, and to reduce the number of negative interactions with those people over the course of your life, you need to take precautions.</p><br><p>You also need to do things like have someone who can make quick and sure health decisions on your behalf. This person doesn't need to be a doctor but one who is trained and willing to help with medical decisions and medical treatment.</p><br><p><strong>If you expect in the future to face health risks associated with living in a world with the opposite sex, or for children of the opposite sex to be a good fit for you:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>If you have a lot of time to plan and can afford to get it right, it would probably be better to choose living in a house where everyone is of the same sex, or for a biological family. You can do this on purpose (like I did for my children) or in the best case for those who are your close friends.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>If the choice is not yours to make:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>As soon as possible, if you are already in a house whose situation would be improved by only making one change, consider having a third bedroom.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>If there are things that are just too good to say no about:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>It's okay to choose the house location and bedroom allocation and other details about the house that allow the housemates to live a good life.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>If only you can put things off indefinitely, or if there are things that cannot be delayed indefinitely:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>Take the most optimal option and do an informed thing then. For example, if you are about to become very excited about going clubbing (with lots of people) consider not going clubbing now and living the same lifestyle in a different house with the same or different people instead. While this would be disappointing to not get the opportunity to live out this new lifestyle, it will be better.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>And if things can't be put off...  if you need to be home because of a lockdown at work or some other situation... then that really sucks, but it really does not mean you have the option of choosing to live with people who are different from you.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>If sex is not a significant part of your identity, there is probably no basis, from the perspective you currently have, to change that:</strong></p><br><p>For those of you who find the gender /\xe2\x80\x8b sexual distinction important in your personal life, while it is definitely important to consider the trade-offs in terms of health and happiness, this study should be viewed with a healthy dose of cynicism.</p><br><p>For others of you who have long held that this is an important distinction and you're likely to choose to have a family that includes children of the opposite-sex (or not to have children at all), the results of this paper may actually make them change their mind, potentially giving them more freedom to shape their lives and the lives of others around them.</p><br><p>For others for whom the issue is not important, the paper has no impact on your decision. But for those of you who have reason to care, this paper may give you reason to care less. </p><br><p><strong>Who is this important for</strong></p><br><p>If this is you, or someone like you...</p><br><p>If you consider having kids a good idea...</p><br><p>If the gender gap is important to your life...</p><br><p>And if you think that everyone else will also think like you...</p><br><p>Take this study seriously.</p><br><p><strong>How did the study work</strong></p><br><p>The main researcher study in question (cite: https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.thelancet.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bjournals/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8blanres/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8barticle/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bPIIS1373-3099(2021)30106-X ) had six points:</p><br><ul>
<li>All adults who participated in the study in England could participate in full</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>All were given a laptop and given the relevant data tracking program and instructed to keep it in their own possession until the study ended on 4/\xe2\x80\x8b21st 2021</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Incentive payment was given to participate in the study for any data (eg. blood pressure measurements taken) which was included in the data analysis.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A group of people on 4/\xe2\x80\x8b21/\xe2\x80\x8b21 were randomized to either being sent the information and consent form for the follow-up survey or not.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Information and consent were given to the first 10,000 people from this lottery group who sent an email requesting to participate.</li>

<li>The follow-up survey was sent out once per day to all the people in the randomization lottery.</li>
