<p>You will speak to the Jedi in person. Go to their temple on Yavin 4, and you will have a message for Padme. You must tell her I have failed her, but that we have begun to restore her to her former health. You will be the one to tell her... I have failed you, my Lady, but you are not alone. I have failed myself.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>\xe2\x80\x93 I.J.Good</p><br><p><em>Star Wars Resurrection</em> opens with this line from a scene on the planet Corell. The screen then shifts to show a man named I.J. (Lucas' initials) Good, who is sitting in a chair, head down, looking at the floor in deep thought.</p><br><p>This is I.J. good, the man who is credited for inspiring the famous quote I've cited above in the <em>Star Wars Resurrection</em> opening. After this scene, the movie <em>Star Wars Resurrection:</em></p><br><p><em>I jus got a call from George. He says, "I need to see you tonight." An hour and a half later he shows up at my hotel... I was sitting on my desk when the doorbell rang and the guy who looks like George Lucas came in. He said, "We're working on a new script. It's called Star Wars Resurrection. We need your help. It's just like _Star Wars</em>, but set in the future."_</p><br><p>_"What is it you want?" _</p><br><p><em>"A little help on a script." George says, "We're going to have Padme."... I said, "Who is she?" So then George says, he says, "You don't know her." I say, "Well, who's she?" He said, "She's the sister of Anakin."</em></p><br><p>This scene shows a real turning point for I.J. when he met George Lucas, as I.J.'s wife explains to us in these early words:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"He met the George Lucas and he was a good deal taller than George Lucas. Anyway, Anakin told... he was a little more of a star than George was," his wife says.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>"If he were smart he would have gone to work for George, but he was a very happy and content being, in his own way."</p><br><p>\xe2\x80\x94The Rise and Fall of I.J.</p><br><p>I.J. and George developed a collaborative style for this project. George needed an I.J. or another top-quality collaborator, and so he found his I.J. collaborator, George. The next morning, I.J. went to his workshop and wrote the script for _Star Wars Resurrection. _</p><br><blockquote>
<p>We got into a taxi. I'm sitting on the back seat. I reach into the glove box and pull the black folder out and open it, and I pull out the script for [_Star Wars Resurrection]. _</p>
</blockquote><br><p>[...]</p><br><p>I had my script. George has had a script every night he's written for <em>Star Wars</em>. I've worked on them with him. So I know what kind of script he's writing in his head, and what kind of thing he's writing, and what kind he is writing at any given time. So there is no problem.</p><br><p>The story of I.J.'S collaboration with George Lucas shows us (1) how to do good collaboration on important projects in a way that has nothing to do with hierarchy, (2) how to overcome status differences, (3) and how to work well with someone who is the same age, sex, and skill level as we are.</p><br><p>Let us look at this script I.J. was sitting on when somebody knocked on the door to his workshop.</p><br><p>This scene, which may be the key scene in the movie, is written on I.J.' s character sheet, which has been left inside the cover, and the name of the character it contains is "Aristoff," meaning "The Great." I.J. reads the script to the Jedi, but "Aristoff" does his talking, not I.J.</p><br><p>Aristoff's first line is, "I will tell you to contact the Jedi, they are the people who can bring Padme back," and then he goes on to tell a very long story, which is a long story, and even longer than the script George was reading to I.J.. For example, he says,</p><br><p>"The woman who looks like <em>George</em> says she has failed him, but George and I are the ones who gave him the chance to be an actor."</p><br><p>Finally, Aristoff's dialogue is interrupted by two knock-knocks on the door. When he opens it, he sees the character name under the name again, and his face is still blank. The Jedi have sent their assistant, a woman, who has apparently forgotten her identity and her mission:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The woman who looks like Aristoff says, "You must come with me." She leads me over to the elevator.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>We ride up to the top floor and go to a door without a faceplate and knock. There is a woman on the other side who looks like Ariston who looks like George, the wife of Anakin. She doesn't know who you are. She is in denial about... Padme.</p><br><p>I.J.: Who do you know to be able to contact the Jedi to this matter?</p><br><p>Aristotn (wife of Anakin): She is Anakin's ex-wife.</p><br><p>I.: Can you contact her?</p><br><p>A.: She can't. It was a long time ago. I should never have let him see her. I was stupid.</p><br><p>P.S. A footnote to the footnote. I originally posted this, but got permission from a friend to delete it. That footnote is:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>I.J. talks here of a scene which would not have occurred in the original script for <em>Star Trek</em>. He was an experienced script writer. When I first wrote it up, it sounded to me more like a scene that had only happened in some rewrites of <em>Star Trek III</em>. The script as it originally appeared in the script vault contained some material I recognized from a script I'd written in 1972: "The Making of a Muddie. Story by George."</p>
