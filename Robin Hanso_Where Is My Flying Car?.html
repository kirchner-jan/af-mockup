<li>An economy that grows as fast as the Internet's current one.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A world population that grows as fast.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A set of increasingly powerful technologies.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A tendency for such technologies to become popular, to enter the world economy.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Uncoordinated actions, with too little knowledge for individuals to understand what the relevant coordination actions could be.</li>
</ul><br><p>The Solution</p><br><ul>
<li>Individuals coordinating (and with a good sense of urgency to do so), but working within a set of institutions which have a good track record for such coordination.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Individuals forming companies.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The right technologies becoming available before the right coordination method is understood.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Coordination methods becoming common knowledge within the relevant institutional clusters.</li>
</ul><br><p>This is intended to match both existing models and common sense about economic growth, population growth, and technological growth, in that people grow too fast, don't understand how their actions might change what will happen, and so so on.
I hope this story may illustrate the basic issues, and also possibly be a rough sketch of what might actually cause such coordination. Note that this is different from common notions of coordination, where it is often a central concern to find the best coordination method.</p><br><p><strong>Story:</strong></p><br><p>The problem. Everyone, no matter who they are or what they do, lives a meager and unfulfilling life.</p><br><ul>
<li>It's not simply that everyone is poorer than people in wealthy nations, such as the U.S. and Europe or Japan.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It's not only that the people in the U.S., Europe, or Japan are wealthier than average.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It isn't even the relative income inequality. It's that the lowest 5% of people are nearly as poor as in the poorest countries in the developing world.</li>
</ul><br><p>The situation is that everyone, no matter who he is or what he does, works a meager wage and gets even less. The lives of the poorest of the poor are barely worth living. Those in the middle-class barely get by, and so on. It is a grim picture â€” almost nobody is secure in his future.</p><br><p>Yet this is the very best we can do. Things have gotten better in the last few centuries, and have probably gotten only better during the last few decades. So why doesn't everyone in the world have a nice luxurious living that lives up to his potential? What's wrong with the economic system, that's producing these results? I'd suggest that there's a mismatch between the economy and the people living it.</p><br><p>What is the economy, and why should it be understood? That's a tough question. But here's my guess.</p><br><p>Our economy is like a big network of roads. Roads form only when there's an advantage to connect two roads, and over time there are enough connected roads to form a network.</p><br><p>It's not the purpose of roads, however, to create their own network. A road has to be built to connect two places, and to connect at least one of those locations.</p><br><p>The same is true of the economy, where it is the purpose of businesses, organizations and jobs to connect to each other and form a network that can reach a point of being a giant web of connections, a network of relationships and transactions. And the key word is "become".</p><br><p>If you were to go the next town and walk from one side of the road leading into town to the opposite side, the roads would connect. You would walk a portion each time, but each walk would, in fact, lead you across the road leading into your own next walk.</p><br><p>If you wanted to build a road, you could first lay out each stretch of road and find the fastest route. You could then create connections that were as fast as those roads, and you could lay out the road that was your connection to the next town a fair distance away. You could also choose when and where to have each connection, so the entire system would connect together. And so on, all the connections would connect by one or another version, until the economy became a giant web.</p><br><p>(That's just one version of a giant web. You can build a vast web of connections, and then have connections within the web, and a wide web of interconnected markets, and so on.)</p><br><p>There's a road you travel each time you cross a road into the next town, and there's a road you traverse when you cross a river to the next town, but you travel the road that goes across both for the shortest route.</p><br><p>And that is the purpose of economic activity, to form connections between people, firms, and networks. All of a person's connections with each other. This could be with other people; it could be with firms; it could be a network with other firms.</p><br><p>A little thought can see the huge gains from network formations that grow their own networks.</p><br><p>You will be much better off if people cross the road you have, because you'll get more customers and suppliers with your road. People will be better off if firms cross your road, because you'll connect with more sources and customers. And so on.</p><br><p>The reason we live in such a miserable world today doesn't seem to be that we don't cross our roads and roads cross ours. It seems odd, to me, that our economies would become so good at forming networks that they form lots of connections on their own. Why couldn't we go back to the first day of the Industrial Revolution and have our economy, instead of having the current vast web of connections? What made the Industrial Revolution so important that we should go through such a difficult stage of economic history? To see if such a development is possible, it seemed worthwhile to create roads of my own.</p><br><p>I took lots of existing business models and put them in a spreadsheet program, and gave them a few assumptions:</p><br><ul>
<li>There will be a small number of existing organizations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Such existing organizations are roughly evenly distributed.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The number of companies in an industry is large relative to the number of roads to cross in the current economy.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Business is a two-sided activity â€” one with a buyer and a supplier.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Business has a marginal cost and marginal revenue.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The size of the business is large relative to its cost</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Business is limited to those with at least one connection to every other customer.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The road network is a giant web connected by roads.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There's at least one road that goes under every road.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There are several different types of roads that go between cities</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The network has a giant, well-connected web of roads.</li>
