<p><em>When I was in sixth grade, I had read a book about the case of a serial killer nicknamed "the Green Boonville Monster," or, as it was called by the media when I was young, the Green Boonville Grissom Monster. The police, of course, thought that it was probably just some guy who liked to murder small children, and some nut, and he wasn't worth taking off his mask. But the media took it seriously. It took a couple of months, various people on the fringes would occasionally accuse me of having "boonville-monster" tattooed on my forehead, and the police would periodically ask me where I got it. Eventually the FBI came by and took my fingerprints, and then they kept asking me where they could drop the print, and I didn't bother to tell them. Then I read about the Boonville case and the "Boonville monster" and realized the people thinking it was a serial killer were exactly as unhinged as the people who thought that "boonville monster" meant that I couldn't possibly have gotten it from the library.</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>\xe2\x80\x93 David Barry</p><br><p>Boonville in Missouri was plagued by a series of murders, beginning with the murder of a five year old girl in 1958. The murderer kidnapped the victim while she was walking in a deserted town at night, and, since he found her in a deserted town, decided not to kill her. Instead, he tied her up, killed her, walked to town, and tied her body to her own body, and left it on the side of an abandoned factory.</p><br><p>The case went cold until the discovery of her remains two years later. She had been tied up in pretty much the same way as many of the previous victims, and the murderer wasn't all that hard to track down. The sheriff showed up to an old apartment full of garbage and took the man living there in for questioning. Later, they realized this guy might have also tied up his girlfriend, and asked her if she had heard from him. She said no. They searched the apartment and found her body, still tied and gagged, with her mouth caked with dirt. When they took her fingerprints later, they found that they matched the killer's.</p><br><p>A couple of days later, the newspapers blew open with another story. The victim had been found raped with animal feces in her eyes and mouth, like the worst sort of monster. Her face had been so horribly mutilated it was difficult to recognize her, her hands and feet had been gouged out, and her torso had been cut with an edged blade to make it appear she had been eviscerated. The investigation into the "boonville" cases ended there, at least until the next year. The sheriff told a reporter "you know, the only reason we didn't know is that there aren't any more of them," and then the case went cold for thirty more years.</p><br><p>But in the meantime, the legend had grown. The <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> noted, in a "fact checking" article, that "Most people are more than willing to believe that there might be monsters, but would not believe that there could be monsters like the Green Boonie Grissom Monster, which were said to have killed more than 500 women.</p><br><p>One particularly prominent reporter, David Barry, made a complete and unapologetic mockery of the whole situation.</p><br><p><em>Barry:</em></p><br><p>I remember when I was in sixth grader, and I had read a story about Boonville's Green Boonie.</p><br><p><em>Crawford:</em></p><br><p>Did it mention the girl had been tied up and killed with animal dung?</p><br><p><em>Barry [chokes on his own saliva]:</em></p><br><p>It did! It did!</p><br><p><em>Crawfords:</em></p><br><p>Then it's true.</p><br><p><em>Barry</em></p><br><p>No... I'm not saying it's true!</p><br><p><em>Crowfords:</em>  What are you saying?</p><br><p><em>Bry:</em>  Well \xe2\x80\x93</p><br><p><em>Crow:</em>  Are you saying you've read more than the story and that the story was an exaggeration? Or do you really think the Green Boonies are monsters?</p><br><p><em>Barr:</em></p><br><p>No \xe2\x80\x93</p><br><p><em>Craw:</em>  All right, then!</p><br><p><em>Barr &amp; Crawford:</em></p><br><p>Are you saying we should just believe him? Do we have any choice? It's in the paper!</p><br><p><em>Cram:</em></p><br><p>Oh, yeah, the newspaper article. That's right!</p><br><p>The people who found themselves with Boonville as a dark recess of their imagination soon discovered Boonville as an <em>explicit</em> dark recess of their psyche, and those few still able to stomach a little Boonville in a dark recess discovered they weren't alone.</p><br><p>The problem of the Green Booniers was also discussed by the <em>New York Times</em>, which, at its peak, was home to a very popular "fact checking" column written by William Rosen \xe2\x80\x93 the one that noted, for example, that of the 500-or-so claimed Green Booners, only a couple dozen had been killed (presumably, the vast majority of the claimed victims were not murdered).  Rosen's successor, Max Frankel, was also on the Green Boonier case \xe2\x80\x93 and Max Frankel's successors aren't, so far as I can tell, on the Monster of Boonville.</p><br><p>The Green Boonier legend was so well known that, even in Boonville once and no more, new journalists and investigators couldn't resist the allure. One famous reporter went to the town's police chief on a particularly curious story.</p><br><p><em>Cop:</em></p><br><p>You remember that case two years ago, with all the garbage and feces in the apartment, and a woman who'd been disemboweled then tied back together?</p><br><p><em>Reporter:</em></p><br><p>That case? I thought it was all just a hoax!</p><br><p>_Cop:___</p><br><p>A hoax? There's been more murder that summer than during the last two years put together!</p><br><p><em>Reporter</em></p><br><p>But \xe2\x80\x93</p><br><p>_Cop:__ _Don't you remember the story about a man with green eyes?</p><br><p><em>Reporters</em></p><br><p>But \xe2\x80\x93 We read about it in the paper! We all did!</p><br><p><em>Cop</em></p><br><p>Look, let's give the guy a chance! All we know is he had green eyes and was dressed in blue jeans and the police thought he had to be crazy and killed a woman with them, maybe left a body somewhere.</p><br><p><em>Reporter.</em></p><br><p>Oh, but it didn't end there! Then some college students looked into it and discovered that the police didn't have any physical evidence and just assumed he was the Green Boonist! Do you know what I saw in that apartment? A mess \xe2\x80\x93 but only the mess. No girl killed \xe2\x80\x93 only the girl.</p><br><p>_Cop _</p><br><p>Come off it! A Green Boony would find it hard to hurt a chick even if it wanted to.</p><br><p>_Reporters _</p><br><p>No, you don't understand! It was \xe2\x80\x93</p><br><p>_Cop.___  Look, let's just give this guy another chance, okay?</p><br><p>There's been a lot of other murders this year, and I know a lot of cops who won't be happy to see the Green Booner made off with a clear conscience. And if you can't take that chance with a really dangerous killer, why would you want to be a cop?</p><br><p><em>Reporteders</em></p><br><p>I have to! Everyone in this town would be in trouble if the Green Boonys were roaming the streets!</p><br><p>_Cop. ___ _Look, I'm starting to get a bad feeling here. The Green Boonys are in it together, and they've been at this for a long, long, long, LONG time. There's something not right, and I don't think it's any coincidence that all the other murders were like this one. The same MO, and in the same town. The same apartment, and the same garbage found. They know something we don't know, and if they found some body somewhere it would be a dead end for obvious reasons, and we'd never be able to catch them. So there's one thing they wouldn't do \xe2\x80\x93 and it's murder the same way we do.</p><br><p><em>Reportedrers.  __Reporter-Grouping:</em>  But \xe2\x80\x93</p><br><p><em>Cop __(explaining as best he can):  </em>"But" doesn't actually have any meaning. "That thing you've labeled "BUT!" isn't a separate, logically valid statement. It's just a really loud noise that happens when they close your mouth. The same way you can argue about whether an object is a chair or a rock. "BUT!" isn' a meaningful statement, it's just noise. It's not logic, it's just really loud noise."</p><br><p>_Reporters (aghast):  _But \xe2\x80\x93 if we ignore "But" and "That thing you call 'MUST!' It's not a meaningful statement, but just a really loud sound." That means the murderer isn't a green person!</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
