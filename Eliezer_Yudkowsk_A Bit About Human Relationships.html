From a vast perspective, you've lived and acted a lot like other people with a lot like your brain architecture: as I recently calculated, your brain architecture is only about four billion synapses!1</p><br><p>If I'd been asked to guess how much a "human relationship" was, I would have guessed that it was a few hundred bits\xe2\x80\x94a few hundred bits of the raw material out of which you are built. But it <em>is</em> true that most, if not all, of your intelligence consists of information about other people.</p><br><p>Once you accept the idea that your relationships with other people constitute a <em>substantive kind of yourself,</em> you can start to say things like, "I feel as though I have a friend, but I'm not my friend."  You can start distinguishing your self-model from an external model of yourself (which you can verify at any time by looking in the mirror while wearing black).  The distinction is not entirely clean, but it's something.</p><br><p>(I don't think this can explain <em>everything</em> that many people believe themselves to believe. There are still a bunch of facts about the world that are best explained in terms of your own personal experience; that doesn't strike me as requiring conscious-level processing at all. But at least I think that once you have this insight, you can see where things get all the way back to people and their beliefs about people.)</p><br><p>But the fact is that you don't know that many other people by introspection... you know other people because you've talked to them.</p><br><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Let's say that when you wake up in the morning, you want to get on Twitter. But you want to get your email and your RSS feeds first.</p><br><p>It turns out, there's an easy button for the RSS feed in your bedroom. Maybe you push the button, your computer asks, "Are you sure?" and you say, "Yes, I want to get feeds!"  Your computer says, "OK", and it looks up your RSS feed on Google, so that's what you just got.2</p><br><p>But you know, you don't <em>really</em> know to get a single RSS feed or a Twitter account. You didn't spend any real effort figuring it out. You're using the search engines "by default."</p><br><p>Maybe it would be better if you could search the term "RSSPIP" in all the search engines on the Internet, or Google "RSS feed," and come up with a Wikipedia article about it. Then you wouldn't ask "Am I sure?"\xe2\x80\x94would just say that the Wikipedia page existed.</p><br><p>But "RSSPIP," Google, and Wikipedia are examples of the <em>social</em> or <em>external</em> models.</p><br><p><strong>The trouble with human relationships</strong> stems, to put it bluntly, from the fact that human brains evolved by natural selection acting over generations, and so you want to know what's true, not just what you believe or want to believe.3  Not every belief that we have about how other people behave is a rational belief, but all rational beliefs are beliefs about other people. You can believe that you should vote (a very sound political philosophy), or that you could convince your friends to vote... but this belief is almost certainly false, a non-belief based on <em>your model</em> of other people.</p><br><p>However, since you <em>don't</em> know all the facts about yourself by introspection, you don't know the probability of all the hypotheses that you could have for how <em>other people</em> would respond to a political discussion.</p><br><p>So at some point it's useful to <em>model other people as humans</em>, to create an <em>external model</em> of <em>other people's beliefs about other people</em>.</p><br><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Suppose you're dating someone for several months, and you meet their parents.4  You have a date with their dad; he's not very intelligent, but nice and friendly.</p><br><p>A few weeks after this date you get to know their mom a little better. She's... well, she's <em>not</em> very intelligent, but she's very <em>emotionally</em> intelligent! You'd never expect it from someone who appears so cold and detached, but her son is in graduate school and she's had five years to keep out of the way of his work and study up, so she can talk intelligently about it for an hour and give you a more complex perspective afterward.5</p><br><p>The parents aren't just warm and friendly, they genuinely <em>enjoy</em> your company. You never would have expected this either.</p><br><p>It was much harder to guess, from your previous knowledge, that your date's mother might be emotionally intelligent, than to guess from your new-found knowledge that the father was not.</p><br><p><strong>This is the great difficulty of human relationships</strong>. You can find out plenty about whether someone is warm and friendly by asking them, but you can't use that as a basis for guessing whether or not their son is in graduate college, or whether or not their mother knows how to take apart a computer and assemble it again, or whether or <em>not</em> their parents enjoyed spending time with you. Even if you <em>have</em> met them before, it's easy to see that someone who shows up very interested in your date's son, or who genuinely enjoys time with you, is quite unlike someone who's showing mild interest in the son. And you, in turn, might have no useful information at all about how intelligent someone's parents are.</p><br><p>So if you have a tendency to attribute your own behavior or your own desires and feelings or personality traits to other people on the basis of how they appear to you, you should perhaps reexamine that attribution. If you think you'd be more likely to like someone based on a trait that they had, how many of these traits should you attribute to yourself? How often do you experience yourself having them, and what would you guess would be the underlying cause?</p><br><p>Maybe a lot of the way you behave is a response to other people's actions, or a consequence of other people's choices?</p><br><p>Perhaps they would be more likely to behave in certain ways by default, and so you might guess the cause of those defaults at the level of "human nature."</p><br><p>It's important to distinguish between the process of hypothesizing <em>a good reason</em> for someone's behavior, versus the process of actually <em>ascribing</em> a fixed, stable human nature to specific people. The human brain is built with a large number of mechanisms for social recognition (the process by which <em>other_people become _known to</em> us).  It doesn't have to be the case that every social-recognition mechanism fits neatly under a distinct label. But it is a separate matter to notice that your attribution is, at bottom, a model made from concepts from within a human brain, rather than a model made from specific things you have observed about people in the past.</p><br><p>For another example:  The <em>reason</em> we <em>care</em> about someone is based on the fact that they <em>care</em> about us. And if you care about someone, the <em>reason</em> you care about them is probably the fact that they care about you. But this chain of inferences can be quite complex. You have to take <em>their _motions as _explanations for yours</em>, and you have to <em>care about them to care</em>.</p><br><p>You start with a belief about someone's feelings, and an attribution of that belief to them because we <em>like _people who act that way. This is the sort of attribution that you can make _before you know their values</em>; what sort of values you should attribute, <em>after</em>, depends on the actual causal pattern that produced your attribution in the first place. If you had just <em>heard</em> the person acted nicely to someone else, you'd probably assume they cared about them as well.</p><br><p>If you attribute a <em>value</em> to someone, or even an explicit "conception of values" from them, based on how they <em>act</em>, then you're likely to underestimate that value, because an explicit value is not generally an output of conscious deliberation.</p><br><p>This insight will become clear more clearly if we turn our attention to a hypothetical question: how would you care about someone who was different from what a typical human being would be?</p><br><p>Let's say that, instead of building a rocket, you become an entrepreneur because it turns out that entrepreneurship is quite profitable when you do it right. And that you're one of the first people to do it right (if you look back, you remember the Internet's first wave of startups, all of whom went bankrupt or got acquired by big companies\xe2\x80\x94that might be enough).  You see someone who is not just a bit different from the typical human being, but <em>entirely different</em>.</p><br><p>How would you care about them? You're aware of their value to entrepreneurs, but so far they are not known to have been <em>consciously reasoned in to existence by all the other people</em> who are known to exist in your mind, the ones who have already been born without you yet.</p><br><p>So let's say that <em>instead</em> of a human being, you meet a brain emulation.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
