They will have so much power that they'll be able to find and destroy all other possible forms of expression. "1</p><br><p>We are still in the midst of such a conflict, and as the world population continues to grow, and the pace of scientific and technological advancement grows inexorably, the power of programmers will make Orwell's prophecy increasingly true. </p><br><p>Or, to put it another way, there are three world's that are colliding. That world of mind that consists of <em>humanity</em>, and that of <em>humanity plus technology</em>, and that which consists of <em>human nature</em> with the power of _science _and _technology _brought to bear. And today you stand in the midst of the third world\xe2\x80\x94and if you're like me, you're tempted to be cynical.</p><br><p>Because the truth, as it turns out, is a lot scarier than he thought: </p><br><blockquote>
<p>The "collision" of three worlds hasn't just been a possibility for a while. It happened here and now, at our very door, and we just haven't quite found the time to admit it.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>As we face both biological and cultural threats to humanity, I hope, we can admit that our world is in the midst of a power crisis. Even today, we can see it. We can feel it: the tension between the world's two camps, the human and the not-human. In an effort to break this tension, many people are trying to merge the two worlds in their effort to survive.</p><br><p>But there are dangers to this merging\xe2\x80\x94most importantly, the danger that some will be left behind, unable to engage in the fight against the "not-human force."</p><br><p>When I use the words "the human force" or "human nature," I am not making a rhetorical appeal for us to fight against nature. I mean to say that humanity is a force, which is, despite its flaws, capable of coordinating for the common goal of survival. While "human nature" is not a homogeneous thing, it has nonetheless the power to achieve great things in the pursuit of survival, including discovering and exploiting new and better technologies. "Human nature" may be flawed and imperfect, but it still is a force that can unite around a common cause.</p><br><p>This brings me to another point: As we face the challenge of the not-human world, we should see it as another opportunity\xe2\x80\x94one which we should also resist. <em>We are at the very frontier of becoming a technology-empowered, not-so-human force. It is inevitable, and it is the very thing we need to confront as we try to survive in the not-human sphere of existence. The challenge is to do it well, and to do it while resisting the temptation to try to merge our worlds.</em></p><br><p>The idea that we could try to merge our three worlds has come before. It is the idea behind <em>The Big Brother _in _1984</em>, for instance. It is also the idea behind many futuristic dystopias. Such stories try to warn us against the potential danger from merging. But I have been of the opinion for years that we must face this very issue head on. </p><br><p>Even the phrase "technology-empowered not-humanity" is overly optimistic. <em>"Technology"</em> is merely a way to describe the world. It will never be a complete description. There will always be a piece of you that is not yet technology, just as there is a piece of you, which is not yet a person. But the world <em>has become</em> technology, and it has become not-human at almost the same moment. So we face another collision of a new world and a old world.</p><br><p>I see our struggle like the struggle of a parent, faced with the question of whether to pull his child from an oncoming car. That is what our struggle with technology-empowered not humanity must be like. Will we let our child be hurt for no reason, when he is one of the most powerful forces in the entire universe? It's a tough question in any case, but it is doubly tough when it comes to a subject capable of destroying us all.</p><br><p>But let's be honest: We already know the answer. Humanity was _always _a force, but it has only just recently become a _human _force. And just as humanity is, I hope, a force capable of becoming greater, even in the face of all its flaws, so I hope that our technology-empowered children will be, too (at least for now). I hope we can be together, but let us not lose sight of the fact that we are rivals, and we must be careful not to forget it or to forgive our children for the fact.</p><br><p>For if humanity has power over technology-empowered non-human forces, but not over not-technology-empowered nonhuman forces, then I fear for what it means to be human. What does it mean to be the kind of thing that would choose to pull its child from an on-coming car?</p><br><p>As one of the powers to be, when we decide between pulling our child from the car, or not pulling our child from a car that is on course to run over him, does not our decision depend on some aspect of <em>ourselves _over which we may have no control? Who, not _we</em>, decides whether our child is a good father?</p><br><p>"We" may think, "But as a father, surely it is up to me to decide whether or not to pull my child from that car!" But this is true; for if the choice depends on some aspect of the person beyond his control, then perhaps this aspect will also be beyond my control. There is an argument, for example, that my genes (those aspects of myself over which I have no choice) will not be me upon the day I die. At that moment, I will not be me. And if the power you give to the machine has no relation, or even no hint, of how to some aspect of me or the machine, it is certainly not up to you to decide for it.</p><br><p>If we consider a _technology-empowered world _of what an "I" is\xe2\x80\x94if "I'm you" means "I'm that little piece of you that can be destroyed by a car"\xe2\x80\x94then the answer is clear, at least in the modern world. Because with enough power, we can control the future. We hold the universe in our grasp. We _are _therefore the ones who decide whether to pull our children. </p><br><p>But what if the concept of "the I that can be destroyed" is no longer the right way to describe ourselves? What if the future does not consist of "I's" that can be destroyed? What if "me" is something that can exist over time, even as someone else uses that same body or that same brain? What if "I" is the concept of "someone who can look over the entire thing?"</p><br><p>In such a world, it will be the human (or a sufficiently human-like thing) who would decide whether our child is good enough as a father. Our children will not be pulled off the train tracks. Rather, their humanity will be the one determining whether we deserve to keep them. They will be the ones who decide that we are good fathers, and keep us around. </p><br><p>And as I pointed out earlier, if you want our best, if you want to see our power to overcome not-humans best used by humans, you must see us as rivals. You must never forget that we are different races, different classes, different religions; and, more than that, we are different species. For it is the interplay between the differing interests within us that enables us to conquer things and overcome the forces of evil. That is the basis of power and its greatness.</p><br><p>The challenge before us is to hold the two worlds together.</p><br><p>And while this may sound to some like trying to hold a rock together at the bottom of a cliff, this is not so far off from what we do every day. We hold together our family. We hold together friends. We hold together different interests. In many ways, we hold together two different classes of society even as we speak. We may not be able to hold together all three, today, but that is not the ultimate challenge. </p><br><p>This is the opportunity. We are at the very front of becoming a world united, even as we begin to face the battle with technology-empowering not-humanity. This world with its power and promise is exactly what our human nature (what this person's body, and this person's brain) wants.</p><br><p>And while it is true that we are in the midst of becoming more like the non-human world, I hope that it will also be true that we can resist that. I hope this can be a lesson of resistance and of understanding. To the extent that I am able to think like a non-human being, and I am not being too human, I hope this post will help my readers. I hope it can be useful in a few ways. For one thing, it can provide a framework for a discussion of our world's struggle with and possibilities for merging its three different classes of forces. </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
