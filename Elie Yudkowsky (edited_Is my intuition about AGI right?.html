I strongly suspect I have much better reasons than the others mentioned and the reasons I'm posting here are not the same as those I gave back in 2007.]</em></p><br><p><strong>[Meta:]</strong></p><br><p>I'm posting this again on LessWrong after more than three years. The main reason is to invite help from the readers:  The post was written before LessWrong became active. The current LW site, not-yet-live, has a better discussion than has previously existed. And yet\xe2\x80\x94there are already some of you here who could perhaps be helpful; and I don't feel the current forums <em>will</em> satisfy your concerns. I will be posting the full draft of this post to Main with some edits and possibly better formatting for more accessibility.</p><br><p><em>[Epistle]</em></p><br><p>"Do you <em>see?</em> He tries to <em>convince us!</em> He <em>expects</em> us to change our minds and accept his opinion!"</p><br><p>"He won't even let us question him!"</p><br><p>"Do <em>you</em> realize how <em>scary he was?</em> I heard all about the cult thing and the brainwashing thing last time around, but this time it's different. <em>This time we caught them in the act of using deception and mind control!</em> And even <em>then</em>\xe2\x80\x94after <em>all</em> the horror that's <em>already</em> been written here\xe2\x80\x94people are still <em>willing</em> to go <em>in</em> and listen to them? Unbelievable! <em>I don't know what the _world</em> has come to!

Like it <em>dosen't even make them mad anymore?</em> <em>"</em></p><br><p>"It's <em>him!</em> It's <em>him!

He's the <em>cause.</em> And he wants to keep us crazy!"</p><br><p>"Yes, yes, yes," said the other voice, "that's exactly what I've been saying. I know, I know, you're crazy."</p><br><p>"It ain't <em>me</em>," said the first voice. "I know I'm right."</p><br><p>[I like to think of myself as having two distinct personalities that coexist peacefully and harmoniously.]</p><br><p>It was the other one who spoke. If it had been the other who kept his face neutral and continued saying "Ain't nuttin' I can do wid you," the other one would have shouted, and then the other one would look at them and smile, and the two of them would have stood there nodding and looking at each with their own eyes, and it would have been okay.</p><br><p>But because it was the first voice, the other one just turned his back and walked away in the dark.</p><br><p><strong>[Preface]</strong></p><br><p>[In the preface to the sequences, I said that if this post is wrong, it's been badly written. In this post, I say:  Be warned that any claims I make in it are <em>not only unrefuted, _but the very opposite of what I intend; and furthermore, that _I am deliberately telling you this not so you can feel superior,</em> but <em>so that you can</em> _notice how the claim I'm making here implies a strong and terrible form of myopia.__ ]</p><br><p>In his classic article "In Defense of Epistemic Hipsters", Eliezer wrote:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Look, you tell me on a gut level that there's all this scientific controversy surrounding global warming...and I'll be the first to say "Ha ha! There's <em>not</em> scientific controversy surrounding global-warming-ism. Scientific controversy is the standard of proof for a false belief, and it's very clear that 'global-warming-ism' is true. It's been experimentally tested many times and confirmed."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Well, this is exactly the sort of situation where, not only do I not have a good example to offer, I literally can't name a single person in either the 'global-warming' or the 'global-cooling' camp whose opinion I respect.</p><br><p>My epistemic <em>credentials</em> are far more respectable. I have a <em>Ph.D. from a respected university,</em> for starters. But do I <em>respect</em> my credentials? I don't know. I suspect I do, a little. At least to some extent. But I also <em>know _that I can make a case _a thousand times</em> stronger for the existence of global warming than I can make for the existence of psychic powers, and yet, the scientific <em>community</em> has reached a consensus that global warming exists, whereas there is no scientific consensus on psychic powers.</p><br><p>To <em>compare</em> that state of affairs to a hypothetical world where (to make things even more extreme) I've heard that the scientific consensus is that psychic powers exist, and I can make a good argument, and no one has ever disagreed with my argument, then <em>that</em> is how you spot an epicycle in an epicycle. You would look at the community of scientists who believe in psychic powers, and consider whether they had a perfect right of their own to believe this. Or if not that, then a perfect right to believe that you had just spotted an epicycle in your own epicycle\xe2\x80\x94the perfect right to say "Yes, I can think of a case where the scientific community may be <em>wrong\xe2\x80\x94_but not the _case</em> I mean\xe2\x80\x94and yes, I know that's probably not what you mean\xe2\x80\x94but why <em>not?</em> Are you really <em>that</em> proud of your science?"</p><br><p>And this, I think, is a key part of my ability to argue the "Aha! An <em>epicure!</em>" response so much more effectively than most people, even most of the Rationalists I know.</p><br><p>(And that is, of course, part of why I was allowed to write all this at the age of nineteen. As well as, hopefully, why I was not allowed to publish it for a while.)</p><br><p>There is a common piece of anti-altruist propaganda that goes: <em>"What kind of person can you be a good person if you think that just helping more will be the answer to saving the whole world?"</em></p><br><p>No. It just won't work. Not for one reason at least. When you hold the belief that <em>helping just one more person</em> could somehow be the key that opens up the floodgates to save the world, it just does not work.</p><br><p>It's not that I don't believe it. It's just that any belief in the power of <em>helping just enough to save the world</em> doesn't let me help enough to save the whole world. <em>There's only one person in the whole world who needs this right now,</em> and they may have already had it. There's only one person who's <em>helping them save the world,</em> and they might not like being thought of that way, but they also might not care what happens to them personally.</p><br><p>There's only one <em>honest</em> way to answer the question "If you could save the world, but only if someone else was helping in some small way, would you?"</p><br><p>It would be more effective to hold the belief:  "I'm someone who helps when they can."</p><br><p>In terms of actions, not beliefs.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
