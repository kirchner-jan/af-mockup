It sounds lovely\xe2\x80\x94everyone gets to enjoy life according to their ideal. But it seems to me that the closer you get to utopia the less it resembles what life means to us. A society of perfect rationality and egalitarianism sounds appealing at first\xe2\x80\x94you would surely enjoy yourselves and everyone else equally; you would have fun and not be bored. But a rational society of any sort with a lot of people is bound to have a certain percentage of people who are _incredibly _hated and despised. Even your close friends and family might be less interested in helping them than they are in helping the rest of you (as a friend once pointed out, "My friends are all nice, but none of them are that nice). </p><br><p>On top of it all, utopias tend to require that everyone follow a lot of rules and avoid certain things, and the more rules, the more unpleasant the experience. This means that people who hate every minute of their daily lives will hate having a rule to follow that takes away even one moment to enjoy something. And the more rules, and the more people who hate having them, the more terrible the life you yourself might live.</p><br><p>Consider for example the story of John C. Wright, who discovered in the late 19th century that he had a rare blood disorder. Given how rare blood conditions are, it seemed possible that blood transfusions could save his life. He tried to find people willing to donate blood, but no one would let him do it\xe2\x80\x94so he bought a blood donor himself and had a transfusion of his own blood. A few days later, however, Wright realized that the transfusion was making him worse instead. Why? The blood donation had, by a quirk of modern medicine, made him temporarily allergic to blood. He had a potentially lethal reaction to the blood of the blood donor, and the only antidote was to have a blood transplant from someone else.</p><br><p>And, if you think about it, what if John Wright had done it in the future? Instead of requiring people to be blood donors, he could have required everyone to undergo annual blood screenings to see if they are allergic to all of the blood types. The blood-donor solution is a short-term one, but if he had discovered in advance that he would have another severe allergic reaction, he could have simply banned blood donations forever. Or, suppose that he had discovered that blood with high levels of a certain substance could be used to cure a lethal disease. He could have banned donations of blood containing high levels of that substance, and then killed people with high levels. The solution would be there if you tried it early enough in advance, and if you didn't try it too hard. </p><br><p>I'm willing to accept that some utopian society's society might have a lot of rules, and be worse off, or at least more different from us. But that's an extreme case. If we looked more in the direction of more general rules, the more likely it was that a society of people who hated everything and were constantly whining because they wanted to do certain things or not be bound by certain laws would end up even more miserable.</p><br><p>So, I've decided to back off a little. I don't mind utopian societies where people hate a lot and are constantly unhappy, as long as no one is _super _unhappy. I'll even accept them that hate everything that exists, as long as at least no one's _super _uncontent. But the closer I am to a Utopia, the more I must insist that my people not be unhappy. When I allow for all the _small _sadness of having limited resources, or having to deal with someone else's irrationality, it will be a step towards that Utopia and unbounded dissatisfaction.</p><br><p>Or, let me go the opposite route: I'll tolerate a society with rules, as long as they're not <em>too</em> oppressive and there's plenty of time in between when everyone can get together, learn the right thing, and do the right thing in their own lives. </p><br><p>But this doesn't sound very plausible to me, so I'll have to do better. I think my general approach is: if a Utopia has any negative consequences you can point out, but not any more than that, it's fine. Everything else is fine-ish even if not all the citizens enjoy themselves all the time. This approach will let us accept more utopias, although they still have limits on suffering. If the idea of an unbounded Utopia ever sounds plausible to you, let's see if we can work up to it.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
