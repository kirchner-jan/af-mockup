In it, we discuss how much complexity in the brain could be explained by "modularity", in particular how much of that comes from the modular structure of connectome-specific harmonic waves (CSHWs), a form of synchrony in the brain's information-processing. Also, we discuss a possible future for our study of the brain, especially in the field of AI safety.</em></p><br><p><strong>Daniel Filan:</strong></p><br><p>It's been a while since we talked about AI safety, but I guess you were talking about it in a video or in the AI Alignment Newsletter. Does the kind of project that we want to work on now relate very much to that kind of thing?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander Kruel:</strong></p><br><p>Yeah. I think it is somewhat, but I don't know how much we can say with any degree of certainty. If you could look at a whole brain connectome, or a whole brain emulation of a human, there is a huge amount of data about what is happening, if you could look at that and you know all the parameters of the model, I mean, maybe you could look at it and infer a lot of things about how the information is being processed by that brain.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel FilAN:</strong></p><br><p>What kinds of things could you say about how they're used?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander Krugl:</strong></p><br><p>Yeah, so I think you might infer things like: "Oh, okay, in this particular case, the processing is happening very slowly." That is because I think that a lot of the information is spread out over many different processes across the synapses. Or that the information that's being processed within a whole lot of synapses across the brain is mostly synchronized.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel, do you want to take a crack at giving a brief explanation of CSHW?</strong></p><br><p><strong>Alexander Krull:</strong></p><br><p>Sure, CSHW are these kind of oscillations in the brain that happen spontaneously in particular regions of the brain and these waves move very slowly. They have a frequency of about 8Hz, which is actually a bit lower than you might think, because their period is longer. They last, I believe, somewhere between 20 and 150 ms, longer than other kinds of oscillations we have. And it's an amazing fact that that wave that moves very slowly through the brain\xe2\x80\x94well, more like a collection of waves\xe2\x80\x94has really complicated waves and so its own waves that move independently, but each one of them is a little bit delayed. This is called temporal coding because there's a little bit of delay in the oscillation. And they can have a precise shape that is basically a sum of these temporal coding patterns and you can use math to relate the shape and the delay of these patterns, and you can predict in advance what the pattern is going to be or something like that. If you just go point of view, you can model the evolution of this pattern or something like that, and because of the fact that it's so slow you know that they're going to be at each other's right half-sides, and that they're going from back to front, and forward to back, and there's different frequencies that correspond to different spatial regions of the brain, and different frequencies that correspond at different times, which they don't necessarily have to be the same, but they're correlated.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel:</strong></p><br><p>Okay, so I want to switch a little bit from thinking about the brain and the nervous system to CSHW. You said for the brain, I think a lot of neuroscientists, a lot of other people, they consider them to be these waves that are synchronized across regions of the brain. To me at least, it sounds like there's another thing that's going on that's more like one synchronous wave moving across the brain. How do you think those are related?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander:</strong></p><br><p>I think one thing that's interesting about CSHW is that when you look at the same person at two separate times, like maybe two minutes apart or something, or two days apart or something, you might still notice that the CSHW have the same relative phase at both times, but I don' think that you will be able to observe any individual wave moving very precisely across the brain. You might be able to infer, "Oh, okay. You know how the time changed in that second, and you know how the brain changed and the change correlates, you know, with that wave pattern?" And, you know, the exact values for the oscillation in each of these timepoints might be something like 60,000 micrometers or 40,000 micrometer for the first timepoint that you have, or 120,000 micrometres for the second time point, or something like that and if you do that sort of analysis on a brain a day after the first time you're measuring it, you will find that the wave phase at that point has now shifted relative to the other, you know, way you measured it, and there's going to be some correlation with the change in the brain you can see there, or maybe not because it's super noisy.</p><br><p><strong>DanielFilan:</strong></p><br><p>So basically I take this to mean that people's understanding of these waves must be, in some sense, about the neurons, the individual neurons, and not about the network in my head? Because when I imagine the two brains, which are, I guess, talking to each other, they're not neurons in the same sense, right?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander Gruel:</strong></p><br><p>Well, I mean, you could measure the neuron parameters and you just, you know the frequencies, you just measure the parameters of the neuron in the network, I believe that there were some experiments that were done in humans, that I think they were able to measure or infer from the brain the oscillation phase relative to other humans, or something like this. And that's I think because it's very slow and they're synchronized across neurons, but not across regions in the brain, it's like some sort of individual neuron wave.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel's Model</strong></p><br><p><strong>Daniel</strong>:</p><br><p>Okay. One more point of curiosity about CSHW. Like my understanding goes: if you look in a brain at a particular part, how much do you think the complexity of the oscillation is at all attributable to the oscillation itself?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander</strong>:</p><br><p>So one way to answer that, what you probably measure if you just look at the surface of a brain, is the local connectivity, you know, how many neurons are going in certain directions; and I think that's good evidence that they may have something to do with each other, but if I had to guess, I would say it's probably not a small component, but maybe half or more of the complexity is from this.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel</strong> (<strong>Editor</strong>)</p><br><p>Let's start by moving to different parts of our subject. Are you convinced by that answer? What if you were interested in e.g. the visual cortex?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander_Gerwe</strong>:</p><br><p>Sure. That sounds reasonable.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel_Gordh:</strong></p><br><p>And that this is a major determinant of whether or not a neuron fires\xe2\x80\x94the frequency of the oscillation? Because I think basically this is a major part of what determines whether or not the neuron fires.</p><br><p><strong>Alexander_Gruel:</strong></p><br><p>It sort of depends on how you define "determining whether or not they fire", right? If you know that there's a neuron, and there's a neuron firing, and the oscillation happens in such a way, and the phase is correct and right and left and maybe right in that neuron and left and so on, and it's very precise with respect to the neurons that are neighboring and in the same layer or however, I think I'm pretty sure that this is actually very influential, because it's very likely that whatever that oscillation is, it is going to result in the neuron firing at the next moment. I mean, the oscillation might not be in this exact position for some reason, but it's going to be in the approximate right side, and that might be enough, right? It's a very complicated interaction between the neuron, the oscillation and the synapse parameters, depending on the exact situation, or it might influence the firing directly instead of only by causing the next firing, so it's not completely certain, I believe.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel [Editor]:</strong></p><br><p>Okay. Does it look like the oscillations themselves play a big role? Or the fact that the neurons are talking to each other?</p><br><p><strong>Alexander [Editor]:</strong>(<strong>Alter Egos</strong>):</p><br><p>What do you mean talking, Daniel? There's also like electrical activity when they pass signals, of course. But do you mean... I mean, what do you mean when you say they "talk"? There's more than one way to interpret what you're saying.</p><br><p><strong>Daniel _____Alter Ego: </strong>(<strong>Alex</strong>)</p><br><p>I mean, I think there's this notion that when talking to somebody, you use different parts of the cortex to understand what they mean than the parts that you use to express yourself.</p><br><p><strong>(Alex)</strong></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
