</ul><br><p><em>Update:</em> I would like to take this a little in the direction people were actually interested in. I think there's a better approach.</p><br><p>This article is not just about "technical explanation", but about two specific forms of it. In the second section, I argue for a mechanistic view that is more like "why", with a focus on the things that are actually present in the universe, and not just what we could find if we looked hard enough. In the third section, I argue in favor of this mechanistic view by giving an actual example, and comparing them with the standard approach.</p><br><p>What do we mean when <em>&gt; we _say "What is X </em>&gt; made_ of?"</p><br><p><em>This</em> is the question people often ask when they are interested in "finding the ultimate explanation".  For example, they ask, "what is red made of?", they ask "why?" and they ask "what are atoms made of?".  And I think they should be able to get useful answers. </p><br><blockquote>
<p>Can we actually figure <em>out _what everything is _made</em> of?</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Of course! But if we start with our current understanding, we shouldn't be surprised that the rest of the world is more diverse and complex than what we think we know (like why some atoms are lighter than others).  In fact, it should not be surprising to us at all (like how we didn't know that stars are made of gas until we discovered helium and hydrogen atoms)! So if we want to say everything is made of parts, what we really mean is that our model/\xe2\x80\x8btheory/\xe2\x80\x8bthing/\xe2\x80\x8bthing/\xe2\x80\x8bthing model is the correct model/\xe2\x80\x8btheory. But that doesn't mean it's the correct thing! But it might be the one we're using anyway.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>No. It's not.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>The standard approach</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This is something people tend to think in terms of "discovering the rules", or even "applying Occam's Razor". Again, my understanding is that it comes from a belief that only certain kinds of explanations should be assigned higher probability. Like, I shouldn't try to explain why someone is not eating, because that doesn't count as an explanation for why they are not eating. But that belief leads philosophers to ask questions like "what is the fundamental law of physics?", because they believe only these types of explanations are valid. </p><br><blockquote>
<p>My interpretation: a </p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>mechanistic view based on what we _actually _observe</p>
</blockquote><br><p>My interpretation is that we're just trying to predict the behavior of the phenomena in the world (we observe its behavior and predict the next observation we'll see based on that). What we do with that belief comes later (like "I predict how this variable will be in the future, therefore I have to use this variable to predict other stuff").  But at first we don't know/\xe2\x80\x8bonly have a model/\xe2\x80\x8btheory we're trying to fit to the phenomena. So we want to understand it at the atomic level, with a mechanistic approach.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Motive</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I think "red as made of smaller things" would work better as an example. The word "red", in English\xe2\x80\x94our language for communication, if that helps\xe2\x80\x94is made up of the words "and" and "is".  Asking "what are atoms as made of?" works pretty well as a first step to find <em>&gt; the</em> model\xe2\x80\x94we just have to figure out what they are.</p><br><p>The difference with the standard approach is that what we're _actually _asking about is what's actually _real, _which is just something you think you know without actually having good evidence for the belief. It's just an assumption. But as soon as you realize you should be looking at the universe directly, your thinking becomes more mechanistic by default, which seems to imply the phrase "the universe is made of atoms" (or whatever the theory is) is actually meaningful.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
