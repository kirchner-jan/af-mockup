<p>"Your resolution shall be, 'A year from now I plan to have achieved my life's goals.'"</p>
</blockquote><br><p>-- John Wesley</p><br><p>It is difficult to <em>avoid</em> New Year's Resolve. We've got our own traditions, such as setting goals to improve in the domains of our choice, and it's often difficult to avoid such traditions if they exist. Thus one of the great joys of Rationality is that it is possible to <em>avoid</em> rituals, rituals which are part of our tribal makeup and keep us stable in the social group. You do not want to end up arguing for the existence of ghosts after spending a few nights in a haunted house.</p><br><p>The same point applies to Resolve: if it sounds too difficult, you will have it for the wrong reasons. Instead you want to <em>solve</em> the problem, and keep on solving it; to keep on seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how often it is blocked. A few more years isn't nearly so awful as having the life ripped out of you <em>now</em>. This is not a trick to convince yourself to avoid the scary parts when they happen. This is the way life actually is.</p><br><p>I know\xe2\x80\x94I've been there, too. When I was a teenager I used to read science fiction books that depicted people who were <em>never</em> saved. The hero always died\xe2\x80\x94even the ones who were given a fighting chance at life. The plot device was that the villain always killed them, then they died in the hospital and later woke up to thank him and be thankful for saving their life. That way everyone stayed at home, never seeing the light at <em>the end</em> of the <em>tunnel</em>, and the books never lost any readers.</p><br><p>I was raised to think that the hero's death was always the most sad part of the story, and that everyone should have to overcome some horrible villain or something. My brain tried to figure out how to get out of that one, until I read HPMOR once...</p><br><p>...and, well, it turns out you can actually just <em>make</em> that light come closer.</p><br><p>Not by going through every single hardship known to humanity. Not by becoming a supercriminal. But by having the courage to <em>actually</em> turn your back on those things and stare in the direction of the light.</p><br><p>(And before there's more screaming, let me also say that the light often won't appear until you've done something about your own self-imposed problems, and you need <em>that</em> courage to do it...  which is also worth keeping in mind.)</p><br><p>So for my own self-imposed troubles, I decided to make these my New Year's Resolves (with the following stipulations:</p><br><ul>
<li>If my life seems okay, I do not owe myself a better future.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If something is going on in my life that needs fixing, I am not doing me any favors by pretending it doesn't exist).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If, however, I determine that I am indeed in a bad time of my life, then I try to make this New Year's Resolute</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I will set a timer for three days, during which I will not discuss or plan out any of my New Year's resolutions, so as not to bias my memory.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If some of my New Year Resolves are self-imposed, then I will still get credit for them in that week in which I do them, to keep me honest about those who try harder on themselves or who just have better lives in general. (For those who don't keep New Year's Resolutes, all the more reason not to be a dickhead.)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If I break the timer, I may, and sometimes will, do something about it.</li>
</ul><br><p>What's the rationalist equivalent of the <em>true</em> way for a year to pass by? It's difficult.</p><br><p>I would say, "If you set yourself a New Year's Resolution at all, then set it at the <em>first</em> possible time. The first week of January is a very terrible time to set your Resolution. There is a good bit of chance that you will fail your own Resolution by then."</p><br><p>However, I have a better idea:</p><br><p>"If, instead of setting specific Resolutes, you find that there is something about the way you are thinking that prevents you from making the right Resolutions, then set up a timer and <em>not talk about your Resolutes at all</em> until the timer goes off. Then brainstorm about what the right Resolutions are. At the end of your brainstorming session, set a timer again and, still without talking, do whichever of your Resolutions seems best, for that <em>particular</em> week."</p><br><p>This way there is no temptation to avoid working on what <em>you really</em> want to work on, because you think there's a chance you'll fail and then become a ghost. The true and best way for a year <em>periodically</em> to pass, by its own standards.</p><br><p>There are three days. At the beginning of the next working week, think up whatever things you think you need to work on this week...  And don't talk about them, or consider them part of your Resolve. (Which gives you an extra Day to work on the next week.)</p><br><p>If one of your Resolutes involves writing a blog post, <em>before</em> January 1st, and you're having trouble for reasons such as being on time-constrained, don't write a blog post now and leave it on a Friday night. You need a lot of time to think up a blog post that is important to the week and to you, which means you'll <em>only</em> think of the important blog posts if you give your mind a chance to finish its thinking in time to talk about it.</p><br><p>A blog post that's important to you and not <em>the most important thing you have to do right now</em>, that <em>really is</em> important to your own progress through a week, and so that blog post has to wait three days before getting the Resolve. If the deadline is at midnight, then the first thing you do is go over and read all the recent posts on the Internet, then re-write your blog post in two hours so that it's good enough to post on a Friday.</p><br><p>There are some legitimate reasons why you might think it's your Resolve, and want to do <em>something</em> about your problem...  But if the real problem in your life, the actual underlying cause of why things are bad for you, is that you're having trouble getting out of bed in the morning...</p><br><p>I don't say this often, but sometimes you have to go against your own preferences <em>in order to get stuff done</em>.</p><br><p>Just write it out: You want to go on a diet? Well, in order to get yourself to go on a <em>better</em> diet, you're going to have to make yourself go off your current diet.</p><br><p>And if you can't make yourself do something because it's against your current <em>self</em>-imposed preferences, then the problem you have is <em>not</em> a rationalist thing, it's a social thing. And the only thing that will get you out of that rut is social engineering.</p><br><p>This also helps you set limits on time-scarcity of resource limitations, or status quo bias, or procrastination. That's why we call this a <em>New Year's Resolve</em>. It's the most important thing everyone resolves at New Year's and it's usually a lot more important than people realize.</p><br><p>As for those <em>other</em> Resolutions, there are too many of them. I suggest a limit of one per week. Resolve to yourself.</p><br><p>When people come to me in tears of distress over the awful thing they've just done, I hear something like: "I've really messed up!"</p><br><p>I reply:  "But how?"</p><br><p>"I wanted to tell my brother off, but he wouldn't listen to me!"</p><br><p>"Then you didn't <em>really</em> want to tell him off."</p><br><p>"I <em>hate</em> everything about my brother!"</p><br><p>"But that's okay, because it's <em>your</em> decision you will have to live with! So that gives you a way to improve a little by getting rid of that self-destructive desire you have, and now you will feel good about taking action towards improving your brother."</p><br><p>(Which, in turn, helps you decide it's not worth ruining your self-esteem to tell your brother off for something that'll just hurt them and not help you.)</p><br><p>And also when people do great things, like inventing the atomic bomb or writing science fiction or inventing math. And they don't realize how much good they've done for themselves by <em>not</em> doing those terrible actions.</p><br><p>As I said in the original post:  "One of the most costly mistakes you can make in running a civilization is to waste the potential of a human being by killing them before they can contribute."</p><br><p>This is one of the most important things anyone sets out to do, and it's easy to put it off into the indefinite future.</p><br><p>By the third day of your resolution, you're <em>either</em> trying to be the sort of person who tells you "No!"  And that feels...  Like...  That's the <em>right</em> thing to do. It's <em>your</em> responsibility to do it. In order to become <em>the sort</em> of person who does it. Who holds themselves to high standards, and sets their own, higher standards of their own accord.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
