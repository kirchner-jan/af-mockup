I will make substantial updates based on this discussion.)</em></p><br><p>In my recent post, I wrote about what we might conclude if we asked a bunch of mathematicians about how much they think mathematicians contribute. In this post I'd like to explain why that was such an interesting question, speculate on what a proper answer might look like, and summarize the main contributions made by mathematically gifted individuals in the twenty-first century.</p><br><p>I'll do my best to explain any key ideas as quickly as possible, without assuming any background. Readers who are mathematically inclined may find the rest of the post rather boring; if so, please don't go anywhere near this summary. </p><br><p>Summary</p><br><p>I think quantifying the economic impact of mathematicians should be attempted, however we know next to nothing about how to do so, and it's unlikely to be attempted in the immediate future. If it was, my bet would be that one of the strongest arguments would be something along the lines of "a bunch of the most productive mathematicians have spent most of their time doing things that no one else wanted to or were able to do, so it's probably not obvious how to measure this at all." (I guess I can also make this argument about the number of people <em>willing to accept papers</em> for their math.)</p><br><p>In other words: I expect we (I) need to think about <em>everything</em>. </p><br><p>Note that this post is entirely independent of: </p><br><ul>
<li>My post about the future of mathematics </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My other recent posts discussing the role of math in the modern world</li>
</ul><br><p>Intro</p><br><p>The two main questions the post touched on are:</p><br><ul>
<li>Given that lots of mathematicians aren't well paid, are there other things we could reasonably say about the value of their work?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If mathematicians contribute more than we might na\xc3\xafvely expect, and especially if the question of salary can't be ignored, what does this tell us about the long-term financial impact of mathematics?</li>
</ul><br><p>Those are the main questions for mathematical impact that I felt were worth posing\xe2\x80\x94that is, I wouldn't want to ignore them in future discussions. I hope to go into more detail in future posts.</p><br><p>One of the main themes in this post is the concept of <em>effective effort</em>. By thinking in this way, I hope to avoid some common pitfalls, in particular:</p><br><ul>
<li>In the past, I've seen mathematicians focus on quantity of published papers <em>over quality</em>, and I think this might have led people to underestimate the role of mathematically gifted individuals.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In the future, I hope that someone at some point will try to quantify the productivity of individual mathematicians, and make some effort to keep a positive impression of those who have done the most good. It might also help to avoid a "who's the dumbest mathematician on record/\xe2\x80\x8bwho cares most if they make 10,000 fewer papers?" dynamic, and to encourage people to think more about the impact of their work overall.</li>
</ul><br><p>That said, I haven't had a chance to look into this issue very exhaustively, and I expect that a lot of important work has been done on this topic in the past, so I also don't expect it to be obvious where I should find the reference, and therefore I don't think you should do any research on it on my behalf. That said, here's what I know so far:</p><br><p>A large body of research <em>has</em> gone into trying to quantify this</p><br><p>There are a <em>lot</em> more posts on the topic of research productivity than I could find on Google or Wikipedia, especially if you restrict to people in the <em>last</em> twenty years, and so this post will focus on the big names. In the past, the work of people like Alexander Grothendieck (who produced about 1\xe2\x81\x843 of the mathematical papers on the arXiv before his death in 2014), Alexander Grothendl\xc3\xa4nder, P. Griffiths, John Chevalley, Mikhail Gromov, Grothendiecks, Vadim Gulevshev, Alexander Kuznetsov, Max Kontsevich, Yuri Manin, J.P. Serre, Z. M. Stankovi\xc4\x87, etc. etc. etc. has been crucial in shaping my understanding of how much mathematical research is being done.</p><br><p>One of my sources is <em>On the Cost of Theoretical Research</em> (Mancinis, 1990), which looks at the productivity of three famous researchers, and finds (by eyeballing the data):</p><br><ul>
<li>Fields medals are only given infrequently to people who seem to contribute zero, so these medals cannot be considered a good measure of research productivity.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Alexander Grothendeick produced one half of all papers on the arxiv in his career. In fact, before that career, he was a physics student with no publications at all, and in the year he won his Fields medal he produced a couple of papers he seems to have written during his free time. This suggests he may have contributed at least <em>as much</em> as other mathematicians\xe2\x80\x94although there's no way we can be sure of this given that he didn't submit the work for review.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Grothendiecker was the only mathematician in the history of mathematics to be able to take three Ph.D.s from three different Universities, so his productivity is naturally going to be overstated.</li>
</ul><br><p>It's also worth noticing that Grothendiecking was <em>unusually</em> prolific; I gather by my own reading that Grothendick produced fewer papers on average per year than Fields Medal winners typically do.</p><br><p>If Grothendiecki had focused for his entire life on things that <em>no one else wanted</em>, i.e., finding some clever way to extend the methods of algebraic geometry to other fields, then this would probably not be enough to contribute <em>as much</em> to the world economy as Grothendieciks <em>do.</em> (At least not without help. This is not Grothendieki himself, but some of his grad students, postdocs, collaborators and people helping him edit drafts of papers and the like.) It's possible we'd be led to ask other questions like, "well, Grothendeik is also an excellent teacher; surely lots of other people would want to get their Ph.D. under his direction even without him having published a paper if they thought they were in a similar position to him?", but I don't feel 100% convinced that this would tell us much more about the value of Grothendieke's math than our current evidence has already.</p><br><p>Some recent progress and the <em>main</em> arguments</p><br><p>Since 2010, I've learned three key pieces of information which I feel fairly confident apply across many different mathematical subfields:</p><br><ul>
<li>There are very few mathematical papers that seem to be of truly original and fundamental interest to a community as diverse as mathematics. But there are a large number of these papers which make some crucial contributions, and which could not have been done by anyone else. If an intelligent and creative person did not exist in the world at the time, the field would not have gone anywhere. This fact is particularly salient in the development of mathematics as a modern field, but it's also true of many other subfields. Mathematicians can be just as helpful as a smart physicist, chemist or biologist even when they themselves don't have an intellectual track record that can be measured, or a very deep theoretical understanding.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The value of the average mathematician's work often lies in being <em>a force multiplier</em> for the work of people who <em>do</em> have those attributes, but who were not interested in that particular problem. Mathematicians are most impactful in research-relevant areas of mathematics precisely because they provide <em>additional leverage</em> for the other researchers. I expect this fact has an especially large role now, and will continue to play a big one in the future. For example, in the case of Grothendeink, it's been noted that he was the major catalyst in the establishment of a new mathematical subject, quantum cohomology, which can provide additional tools to other researchers in order to attack problems in other areas.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In particular, there is a kind of thing called the "math debt" hypothesis\xe2\x80\x94which in its strongest form says that if you go back far enough, all the people who did important things in one area will have interacted with other important people in other areas in the past, and in that sense <em>most of the</em> <em>importance for the history of mathematics has been in the last one hundred years.</em></li>
</ul><br><p>This last one is the one I feel the greatest certainty about, but of the three, I'm <em>less clear</em> about what the second one means, and at least in the case of the second point it might also depend on how far back we want to go. (I expect that people at least in the last 150-200 years have been more often at the very cutting-edge of their professional careers.)</p><br><p>The upshot is that I think it's very likely that the number of mathematicians who contribute at a high level is greater than any na\xc3\xafve estimate based on their number of papers. But this also seems to imply that the value of mathematical contributions is a whole lot more difficult to estimate than just looking at a "traditional" economist's intuition\xe2\x80\x94especially one who doesn't really bother reading up on statistics or philosophy of numbers, or on the mathematical foundations of economics.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
