Academia seems to mostly be okay with having its power and influence concentrated in its own hands, and it's mostly not a major concern that those holding such positions wield great power to spread things they agree with, and then use that power to protect themselves and their own privileges, and also to spread things they disagree with. There are occasional accusations of bad research practices, in which academia is the ultimate villain, and also in which there are occasional complaints that the centralization of power in such institutions leads to bad research practices.</p><br><p>What of freedom of speech, the freedom to oppose things held to be wrong?</p><br><p>One reason this is so important is that it's the mechanism by which bad ideas can get suppressed, and/\xe2\x80\x8bor good ideas can get spread. Thus, the very existence of the First Amendment is an issue. What if freedom of speech isn't even <em>recognized</em> as a value anymore, despite still existing on paper somewhere, as the last value our founders placed upon the new nation of the United States (and to a lesser degree, but also important, on the other new nation, the United Kingdom)?</p><br><p>This matters because the _definition _of 'academic freedom' has been increasingly used, not only to suppress any criticism or criticism of existing policies or institutions, but _criticism of that very thing itself. _</p><br><p>There's been the talk in some circles of not only having to tolerate 'hate speech' but also of punishing those who use it, in which case the First Amendment would suddenly be off limits.</p><br><p>What about speech which is merely <em>unpopular?</em></p><br><p>There's a very common reaction to claims that we need to defend freedom and academic freedom against attempts to censor speech in what are effectively political speech disputes, and that this is _the very thing we are doing to censor such speech. _That there is a real and very good reason to support such censorship and defend such speech in our own institutions, and that the people arguing against this are on the wrong side, would be the same mistake in reasoning as supporting such censorship, both because freedom is also important, as demonstrated by the fact that the speech has already been censured, and also to avoid the same mistake, to not get in the habit of supporting suppression of speech that doesn't suppress a particular kind of speech.</p><br><p>This also matters because it's, in practice, what's been happening. If I write an essay with an unpopular or politically incorrect point that I've already decided to make anyway, I'm going to be told that 'unpopular views' deserve no protection, or else those with such opinions are a threat and should be silenced. So if that's what we now believe, we've also learned a general truth about freedom of speech, that you have the protection if and only if you are on the winning side of whatever the current political issue may be. As we see.</p><br><p>Some academics want to deny academic freedom to anyone who disagrees with them, or claims not to follow an acceptable procedure (I'll link to their statements, but first, the relevant part of Scott's post) and so on. If this were allowed to expand to all forms of speech, and one in particular, that would be a dangerous road to go down.</p><br><p>Scott linked me to a very similar article, so now let's talk about it.</p><br><p>This is, in the view of the speaker, how universities _do _academics.</p><br><p>There's no way to prove it's the only way, but at this point, I _think _this is pretty much what 'academics' are becoming. And this is how the academic class has been behaving, in practice, for a long time.</p><br><p>Yes, they complain about this all the time. But here's what they're doing, and the signs are that this is what they're planning to continue and make increasingly central in the future.</p><br><p>We have a long-standing view at MIRI that the academic culture we want to create is one that values intellectual freedom, including intellectual freedom of thought. While many of our academics have no problem with us using money to hire others to develop math, including in the case of others developing math we disagree with, that is a different type of intellectual 'freedom' and the one we care most about.</p><br><p>Our current job at MIRI is to do research, and if and only if one of these approaches becomes the right approach, not to <em>advocate for our position publicly \xe2\x80\x93 we have our day job</em>.</p><br><p>But it's very early in the process, and there's very little to say publicly about our position \xe2\x80\x93 there's hardly even been a chance to gather any more information than the few things I've said in the above paragraph. Not that we're avoiding gathering information, mind you, just that I think we're doing very little of it.</p><br><p>That said, there are some issues out there that are very relevant to the issue, that we're actively talking about. There's some discussion in the world of how to determine what it is we're doing when we're doing research, <em>and I expect that discussion is not going well,</em> especially when discussing the nature of research or its role in a larger ecosystem and organization. Other issues matter too, and a lot of them. And more than that, it's a big damn complicated problem. So far, this is the most complicated problem we've ever faced.</p><br><p>None of this has to be about ideology. Or beliefs. Or free thought. Freedom of thought is fundamental to the pursuit of truth, and everything else. You _can 'think and speak freely' _if you want to 'think or speak freely' on a subject, but that doesn't mean the other people aren't going to object. If so, _that's their problem, not yours. _It's their problem. You only want the truth as a precondition to making good conclusions. (You don't have to talk publicly about it; you just want private knowledge.)</p><br><p>But you could say 'free speech,' and _also _that people can think the truth or wrong, or be wrong, and speak freely too. There's a thing called intellectual openness and freedom, with a lot of different definitions, and that one definition that has the broadest appeal makes the phrase vulnerable to abuse. That doesn't mean you can't care about intellectual freedom. But _all _intellectual freedom matters and you _all _care about your intellectual freedom. _Everyone _should care about intellectual freedom and no one should take the claim we care about such things and use it as a cloak of protection to cover things they want to censor, and we should certainly all understand that this is what we're doing by using terms of support for such censorship.</p><br><p>There was an important thing missing from the article Scott linked to and other recent articles criticizing academia: a clear distinction between the two classes of 'academia' and 'academia of that exact kind and form that we at MIRI are most worried about.' This is a problem, because it means that _anyone _who claims that their 'academic freedom is under attack' is by default claiming that the academic freedom at MIRI, or any of the other places one might expect such protections, is under attack.</p><br><p>Even if they're only going to be protecting themselves or their friends or supporters, the claim itself is now a claim about the _status _of such protections. We call them 'academic freedom.' But some of us are not trying to protect academic freedom in any way, or to make it a part of our job, or to make MIRI the arbiter of what constitutes MIRI research. That wouldn't be what such protections were for, and they are in fact there in large measure to ensure the protections of rights we all already hold, and to allow _other _people to share in protecting those rights in _other _places, even if they are in ways we might not like.</p><br><p>So what is our view of academic freedom?</p><br><p>In the long-term, we think we need to protect intellectual freedom, and we think we can do it in the following way. We want to give the public and other external groups a clear expectation and default that the things we are doing and think to be important to the mission here, and especially the mission of our field of research, will be understood that way, and will stay that way, until and unless we decide otherwise.</p><br><p>That doesn't mean we'll <em>never _advocate for or against anything, but it means that we'll do that _only if and only if we think the position being expressed is relevant to the mission and to our analysis of that mission.</em> Which is to say, our position on things other than MIRI's position on many issues will be determined and expressed by the MIRI position, not the other way around, especially on subjects which are of little consequence to the mission (think policy or charity donations, or anything else, except inasmuch as those things are likely to help our goal of helping people be saved, or the goal of helping our field of research develop and understand important facts, or otherwise help to ensure that the work we do and think to be valuable has its intended effects).</p><br><p>That's _the whole point of having a well-defined, explicit 'position' and a 'position paper' and all that. _</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
