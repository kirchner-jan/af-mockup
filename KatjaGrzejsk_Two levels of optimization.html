For a given problem-solution, it seems that there is a very high level of optimization going on, in which someone tries to figure out how to solve a problem (solution) and it turns out that they solved it (solution), or no one solves the problem (failure to solve). This high-level optimization may itself be a problem-solution.</p><br><p>Some examples:</p><br><ul>
<li>Someone was trying to solve a problem, and some low-level optimization in their brain made them solve it by making up a story about how the problem will take care of itself. Later, someone else found that this story was wrong, but they still ended up with a solution-story (pro-solution behavior).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you're in a bar, having a hard problem of choosing which of two cocktails at the bar to drink for money, and the bartenders are optimizing for serving you the most profitable cocktail, but not optimizing much for serving you a particular cocktail\xe2\x80\x94you try to do the former by coming up with a story about how your problem, if solved, would make the bartender give you the more expensive drink. However, this is the first step in the process of finding out whether your problem was solved or not. If no one could solve the real problem, no one might have come up with the solution story.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People can solve problems like this one by making a list of potential ways to do something and then trying to solve the problem in a way that's compatible with existing solution ideas on the list (pro-solving behavior).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The mind has a very fast, easy, and cheap way to tell whether a particular high-level solution (one with a complicated story about how it works) was found or not\xe2\x80\x94we have what could plausibly be called the "solution knowledge". If a solution-story sounds a bit complicated or seems too implausible to us after the fact, then we reject it as obviously failing to solve the problem. If it _does _sound a good explanation and explain why the problem was solved, we have passed this first test.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>As in many other thought experiments on levels of optimization, it can feel like a sort of magic to have this kind of solution knowledge\xe2\x80\x94it seems as if we could just have a complicated explanation for the solution without the magic knowledge, and still successfully solve the problem. However, to solve the problem it is enough for someone to know how to do it in the first place.</li>
