This article describes our apparent continuity of experience from ancient times to the present, and highlights some of the mysteries that arise from this fact. Our apparent continuity of experience is not surprising in physics, where time is constructed as a single dimension within 4-dimensional space. However, it is surprising according to any other theory, which needs to postulate that space has an additional dimension that would not otherwise explain anything. In this article, we show that a consistent theory of time that does not postulate the emergence of space can also explain our apparent continuity of time. Therefore, there are reasons to think that our apparent continuity of human experience might not be as surprising as it first appears. The mystery of the apparent continuity of human events may be less mysterious upon reflection.</p><br><p>If we try to imagine a hypothetical world where we never left Earth, what would that world be like? We cannot see it directly because we are here, experiencing it; but that same experience that we are now, would have been there if we had not existed.</p><br><p>Similarly, if there existed a civilization where science still hadn't been invented, what would that civilization be like? It is probably unimaginable. But that imagination, that same imagination that we use now to imagine ourselves in that civilization, would be there if we had been there. We have a picture of it in our own heads now, that we could have obtained if we had not been there.</p><br><p>Our lives now are continuous and complete with the lives of all those around us in all possible worlds, because the future experiences of ourselves are also there in all possible worlds. Thus the future appears as though it consists entirely of a single instant of time, such that what happens now happens everywhere and always, past, future and perhaps in several other possible dimensions, while what is seen is an object in 4 dimensions.</p><br><p>What if this were not the case? What if in fact there were several possible other dimensions in addition to the ordinary size of space\xe2\x80\x94perhaps even dimensions of existence that are too small to be measurable\xe2\x80\x94but which nevertheless exist, by being experienced in some other way, or perhaps by a different nature than they are experienced in our world? Then what is that other world, where the future did not have it? Where did the future go? Did time change its direction or speed?</p><br><p>This is not just a fanciful question. It is not even merely one we may not know the answer to, because we have not observed it yet. To explain why time appears "continuous" would require us to explain why the future does not have some physical property that is not there in the past, if all observers have the exact same experiences. In other words, it would require us to postulate a discontinuity in time\xe2\x80\x94something that would appear to us to exist, even when we did not see it. This sounds impossible; but it is not.</p><br><p>In our own world, what we call "time" may be the same thing as a natural process used to describe the motion of events; the motion of events which in our world is determined entirely by physical laws. Some people have suggested the possibility of a physics in which time is not fundamental, in which some events exist only for the briefest of periods and then cease to exist, and others (for example, Hugh Everett) have suggested that time itself is an illusion which we cannot even imagine. But it does not really make sense from the point of view of most other physical theories of physics, which are based on the existence of time and have time as a fundamental component.</p><br><p>Our own world has a few constants that have been observed, which are the only things in existence besides space\xe2\x80\x94mass and energy, and time itself, of course. There may be other things that have not yet been observed, things that do exist, such as "potential" and "flow." We cannot test this by experiment, because the laws of physics, and the laws of our own universe, make it impossible to travel faster-than-light. But that does not mean that potential and flow never exist.</p><br><p>From the point of view where time is a fundamental ingredient\xe2\x80\x94the point of view from within physics\xe2\x80\x94it is not surprising that time seems continuous. It is not surprising if we are considering the laws of physics themselves, because those laws have never once changed in the history of the universe, that we will ever observe to see, that has ever existed. It is not the laws of physics that make time itself seem continuous, but time itself is part of the laws of physics as they are found in our world. The laws of physics give rise to the appearance of continuity, rather than seeming to give rise to continuity.</p><br><p>From outside physics as well, it is not surprising that a time <em>seeming</em> continuous happens to appear continuous from within physics, unless the outside view implies that physics must be incomplete\xe2\x80\x94that it must include an additional ingredient beyond mass and energy that is missing from all observation.</p><br><p>There may be a discontinuity in reality inside physics, which we cannot even see, and which we cannot ever even suspect that we might see. If our own universe is a 4dimensional blob within some higher-dimensional space, our 4 dimensions may be what we call "mass", "energy", etc., while the other dimensions could be called "physics", "potential", and "flow." But this is an anthropic hypothesis, invented to explain why things are the way they are. It is not a physical law, but explains our observation of physics.</p><br><p>From within physics, time looks continuous simply because it is what physics <em>is</em>. Time is fundamental in physics; all the objects in physics, from quarks to galaxies, have their time as part of their existence. Time has never changed, in the history of time that the laws of physics have permitted.</p><br><p>But from outside physics as well as from within physics, it may be that the laws of time have changed beyond what we know. The future may have turned out to have been something else, if time had not continued existing as it has within physics. This may be as the question itself suggests: could this question be asked, and the future answer would be different? This is the question of subjective immortality, which may not even exist: what would it mean for a copy of me to have existed in the future, if the copy is no longer me?</p><br><p>If the answer to the question of subjective immorality has been negative, there is at least one way out. I might have gone to sleep in the future; then all the copies in that future\xe2\x80\x94who are currently me, or that I have created or created in other ways\xe2\x80\x94would have been me. That means I would have been a future copy of myself, so the question of subjective permanence of me would have applied to me; and not to a copy from a previous me, who would lack memory of being me. In the past, I wouldn't have thought of this possibility, when I was considering time as a continuous variable; but the same physical laws that make time itself continuous, also make the question of whether this thought had occurred to me in the past, or would occur to me in the future, irrelevant.</p><br><p>This is another way of explaining the apparent continuity of what we have called time, as an emergent property of physics\xe2\x80\x94of time itself, if there is some additional physics beyond energy. I cannot see it, and may not have thought of it; but to the physicists, my observations were the same in both worlds.</p><br><p>From my perspective as someone outside physics, time now and I, now both exist in the now; yet we also both exist as copies, or potentials, or flows that will never occur. Therefore, from outside time and the particular laws of physics that describe and regulate it, I can conclude that even though our physical histories now appear to be continuous, there is no reason why this should be the case, and we may have access to evidence that shows time to be discontinuous.</p><br><p>Perhaps there is evidence of time being discontinuous, yet it has not yet occurred to us to look for it. Perhaps we have never tried. Or perhaps there is no such thing.</p><br><p>Answers to such questions are likely to be subjective; thus they cannot be scientific. Yet they may be interesting.</p><br><p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Reply to Luke Muehlhauser: </strong></p><br><p>Yes in this particular case. And I'm curious about other examples.</p><br><p>For example, I can imagine that in the future we may get information about time from a different dimension. Perhaps it happens to have a structure compatible with our intuitions about time. That way we wouldn't have to assume the existence of physics. But then we're still left with the question of why it is compatible with our experience, and that would be subjectivity.</p><br><p>Also, this approach relies on a particular notion of time. Perhaps there exists some notion of time with all the right properties, that is compatible with physics; but such a notion could not be used subjectively, nor could we derive it from anything else, not even from the notion of time.</p><br><p>Also related is the question of what determines the value on this question. If the answer is subjective, then that means it depends on my subjective experience of that thing. So the answer depends, not on something I can know directly, but on how I decide to define that thing.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
