(Or look at the dust specks, or the way your fingers smell right after they've touched dirt\xe2\x80\x94you may not want to look.)</p><br><p>Because you've kept that door closed most of your life ("it makes me feel private..."), you don't remember how your brain looked when it was open.</p><br><p>For two years while you were learning to program you would do your programming in those basement rooms, and you would walk up to your computer for the bathroom, back down to the cellar door, and step into the light.</p><br><p>Now the cellar is an automatic reflex, and walking up to the computer isn't.</p><br><p>When your brain saw <em>all</em> those rooms stacked with boxes in the dark, it didn't have cognitive access to a picture of the contents of those boxes. So it didn't know how <em>private</em> it felt each time it opened its eyes in the darkness.</p><br><p>The cognitive science of the human brain isn't exactly settled, it may very well be that it's possible for a human\xe2\x80\x94especially a human raised in a <em>completely</em> non-visual sense\xe2\x80\x94that their <em>entire</em> vision of a room is just a picture of a room's <em>contents.</em> The room's colorless boxes might just be a real picture of the room's contents.</p><br><p>The brain goes on doing things that it can't see.  "Can't see" is a relative term; your eyes go on staring at that same cellar door, over and over, for years. The human brain cannot actually <em>fail</em> to see something for the first time. Your brain is just <em>refusing</em> to process it for the first time, because it doesn't see a reason to.</p><br><p>So in one sense your brain's <em>entire</em> visual field is not <em>consciously</em> available to you. But in another sense the <em>entire</em> contents of the box you're carrying up from the cellar, are <em>available inside you</em>, to the brain's "perception."</p><br><p>Your brain is operating inside the cellar, and visualizing its own operation. If the cellar door has an image on its flat surface\xe2\x80\x94a picture of, say, a door that swings open\xe2\x80\x94then your brain may not know, until you open the cellar door and see the picture on the picture. But the brain can see pictures in its own visual field. And it is more than plausible that, in order to conceive that some visual scene is real, as opposed to imaginary, the brain may not <em>actually _need to form an _explicit</em> visual image. The brain may just need to form a <em>visual mental image</em> of itself looking at reality, such that the brain's cognitive system imagines itself seeing it.1</p><br><p>This is the difference between what you <em>see yourself</em> doing, and what you <em>believe</em> yourself to be thinking about yourself.</p><br><p>For example: If you believe that you are doing cognitive science, what you are really doing is visualizing yourself doing cognitive science. You have an image of yourself in front of the camera, looking at the screen on which it displays cognitive science, and you have an image of it writing its own program (and remembering how it wrote it). But your brain does not consciously recognize that it is in fact the <em>screen</em> that it seems to look at.</p><br><p>So that's another difference between what you think your <em>imagination</em> is doing, and what reality calls your <em>perception:</em> the <em>imaginative picture</em> forms in your head where you would see the physical screen.</p><br><p>But it would still be an error to conclude that your brain is doing only <em>imagination. _You have an _imagined picture of yourself in front</em> of an <em>imagined screen</em>, in the <em>mind. 2 _You perceive it that way because it seems to be what's going on, not because the _physical reality</em> is like that.</p><br><p>So if you can understand this, you'll understand that evolution can form a belief like "2+2=4" in your brain by changing the brain's visualizations to match <em>physical reality</em>... which you wouldn't <em>actually</em> visualize in the physical world, so that your brain wouldn't _actually _know about this.</p><br><p>And you say "But I <em>imagine</em> a tree growing inside an empty cellar, and a visual image of it."  Do you really <em>imagine</em> it that way in your mind, or do you visualize the real thing that your eyes are seeing?</p><br><p>1In a sense, all the contents of your visual field are available to you all the time\xe2\x80\x94at least in your imagination. If you could form explicit visual images in your imagination, your visual field would become conscious in a very real sense. It is very likely that the contents and format of visual imagination differ from the way that our visual experience <em>is,</em> to some extent. But the difference only matters in a relatively minor sense.</p><br><p>2The distinction between "imagination" and "perception" is a matter of human convention\xe2\x80\x94one that, as an adult, I've consciously chosen to adopt, just because it seems like a useful thing to do. You may form different beliefs about what it means to ask whether you "imagine" an apple falling, if you haven't decided the question for yourself\xe2\x80\x94if you can form any <em>particular</em> belief about it\xe2\x80\x94in contrast to <em>describing</em> your brain's internal mental processes.</p><br><p>And by hypothesis, it seems like it <em>might be</em> possible to convince yourself that 2+2 really is 5, just by believing so firmly enough that you don't <em>know</em> what reality looks like except from inside the belief. I'm working with <em>extremely</em> simplified assumptions here.</p><br><p>It may be that the ability to convince one's self that 2+2 is equal to 5, is a necessary requirement for the ability to <em>imagine</em> that 2+2 might really be 4 or something...</p><br><p>Or if you're doing "logical" deductive reasoning, you may be able to visualize the steps leading to the conclusion, where in your visualization the logical steps appear to be valid. You may be able to <em>visualize</em> the way reality <em>seems</em> to be\xe2\x80\x94but not the <em>logical way reality really is</em>. Or maybe you can't <em>actually</em> picture that either.</p><br><p>But at least it may be possible to <em>feel</em> what reality <em>actually does\xe2\x80\x94_to visualize what it _actually looks like _internally, whether you can do it by _imagining</em> it, or by <em>imagining</em> yourself imagining it.</p><br><p>Imagine the brain does some of this "believing true things"\xe2\x80\x94then you may have a visual mental image of a brain that believes true things. But it seems <em>plausible</em> to me, for this type of process to happen, that what you have in mind, when you form this belief, is indeed a visual image inside your mind: a belief created by belief. This would just be another kind of belief about the state of reality, like any other. It would be a belief about the <em>shape or content</em> of the belief which you formed about reality, not reality itself.</p><br><p>It's entirely possible, then, to form beliefs such as "2+2 equals 5."  The same brain that processes sensory input (in its non-conscious visual imagination) could conceivably just <em>imagine _beliefs about the _shape</em> and <em>content</em> of beliefs, in its imaginary visual field, rather than <em>believing</em> in the shape and content of any one belief.</p><br><p>3See "Imagination and Willpower" for a longer discussion.</p><br><p>4One way to imagine changing the visualizations to match reality, would be to _visualize _the internal mental states which caused the belief, and then visualize the corresponding real-world result of them.</p><br><p>In the future, you might be able to use "logic visualization" to visualize the result of "2+2" actually being "5", in conjunction with your explicit belief or knowledge or explicit visual perception of the result. By carefully and consciously visualizing it the way the math or logic is supposed to go, you can ensure it <em>does</em> go that way in your visualization.</p><br><p>It certainly seems possible to <em>visualize yourself</em> believing something, especially when trying to consciously direct your brain. But visualizing it can only go so far.</p><br><p>When we deliberately direct our thoughts, we do it by <em>changing our intentions</em> about what we're looking at. And changing your brain's intentions can only affect the visualizations which you have visualized in your <em>own</em> visual imagination.</p><br><p>4The visualization and imagination which we use by default, in forming beliefs and decisions, won't be very <em>specific</em>. This is because beliefs and decisions are too <em>abstract;</em> you can't put in all the details. It's too hard to _imagine the real thing, _when you're having to visualize that thing in your imagination.</p><br><p>So, for example, you can visualize a human being to be black, if you want to form a belief about that: but you couldn't _imagine the colorlessness _of a blackness that wasn't in your visual visualization.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
