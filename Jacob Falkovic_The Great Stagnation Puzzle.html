This is a short post about my blog writing.</p><br><p>Since 2008 Robin Hanson proposed the Great Stagnation idea, which posits "a dramatic slowdown of human progress over the past ~40 years". For example, he estimates that the economy has grown at a rate of ~5% per year since 1960, but now has stagnated at about 1.6% per year.</p><br><p>The phrase has now gone from Robin to "the Great Stagnation". A quick look at Google says that most "Great Stagnation" mentions of the blog come from a few articles claiming the reverse. The post here is not at all at odds with those claims.</p><br><p>The Great Stagnation is often claimed to be the reason for rising inequality, immigration, and cultural disintegration in the developed world. The implication is that we are stalling at an inadequate level, and things won't get better without radical action. But are there really so many people who are unhappy with the world as it is?</p><br><p>The following is an edited excerpt from the latest edition of Putanumonitri, one-hundred sixty-fifth piece of writing.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Some people believe stagnation. Some people believe that human affairs are good enough and should continue to be. I believe that both groups understand very little about history, human nature, and technological progress. And I worry that people take the wrong lesson from history: that progress must continue for better or worse; that stagnation is bad and can get worse; that, unless you fight it, we should expect more of it in the future.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This post is not about how to fight stagnation, but how to understand it.</p><br><p>The two-thousand-year journey to the Industrial Revolution was not an especially slow one; it was more like a sprint. By 1700, humanity was pulling in 100% of the power from the universe into its own hands.</p><br><p>And it wasn't due to a lack of technological innovation either:</p><br><p>I think that people who claim to think about innovation like this, think about innovation like an explorer thinks about mountain passes. There are exciting peaks ahead, and the first impulse to be drawn to them is to jump into the front seat of an exciting new technology. But the front seat of a car is a narrow and dangerous place to be. It's not a place for everyone. And so, people who have that impulse keep moving up, toward the more and more promising front seats.</p><br><p>But, as more and more people are pulled from the back seats into the front ones, suddenly we get a traffic jam. And it hasn't been broken by any particular technological innovation, but just by the gradual diffusion of a single technology.</p><br><p>So, when people describe the Great Stagnations they have in mind, they don't actually say that it was "stuck". What they mean is that the "technology that will break the great stagnation" has still not been invented.</p><br><p>The first great Stagnation was the Roman Empire, the Industrial Revolution isn't anywhere near over.</p><br><p>The Industrial Revolution took humanity from having 0-100% of the world's productive resources within its control to having 60%+ of the planet's. This transition was not "stuck", it happened, and it took centuries.</p><br><p>(We do have a number of technologies that are now part of the Industrial Revolution, such as machines, clocks, and communications. However, I think that all of those technologies were around in Europe well before the Industrial Revolution, and they contributed a lot to European society's development, including the development of the Industrial Revolution.)</p><br><p>I expect there to be two more great Stagnations \xe2\x80\x93 one after the next. And I think that, before the next one, we should be doing all in our power to push the frontier of human knowledge forward, especially knowledge of human nature. And in case that fails, we should be creating radical new technologies.</p><br><p>And if all else fails, the question of whether human societies can survive the onslaught of new inventions and trends is the one that my generation and our children's generation will need to answer.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
