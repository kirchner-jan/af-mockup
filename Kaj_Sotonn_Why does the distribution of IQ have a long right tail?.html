He was very intelligent, and had a PhD in theoretical computer science at age 30. He liked sports, reading, cooking, and playing chess. The only things he didn't really care for were politics and religion.</p><br><p>My mother was religious. She was extremely devout. She would spend hours a day in church, go to prayer meetings, and make sure to have time to spend with her kids. She was a great cook, she loved sports, reading, and chess, went on walks every morning with my sister, and really enjoyed her three year old. She often referred me to my father if my grades were below average, or if I asked my sister about how to walk home safely without her. She also spent a lot of time making sure to be a good father.</p><br><p>On the surface, everything about my upbringing and development is normal; I don't see an outstanding potential for abuse or anything. What I want to know is what the distribution of IQ actually looks like. The reason I am raising this question is because I read a while back a post on "the secret of intelligence" which asserted that the distribution of IQ in the United States is unusually uniform; and in support of this claim, cited the work of psychologist Charles Murray.</p><br><p>Murray's research was published in the form of The Bell Curve in 1969, at a time when IQ tests were fairly new. There were many reasons to suspect his research might be flawed, but he gathered some interesting data that he felt was indicative of an unusual distribution for the IQ population. To me at least, his empirical claims seemed to be well supported. There was an overwhelming consensus among intellectuals at the time that the average American's IQ tended to be at least as high as 125.</p><br><p>In fact, there's been little or no movement in this direction since then. The average level of IQ in the US seems to have remained about 115 for the last 50 years. I have not, to the best of my knowledge, seen any other researchers look at the empirical situation in any detail since Murray, and find that the trend is basically the same except it goes higher\xe2\x80\x94in fact, in the past 50 years the mean has remained around 125.</p><br><p>Looking again at the sources in question I can't find any sign that the situation has changed. The source which most often cites Murray's research is Intelligence. A Very Short Introduction, by Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein. It was Murray's work that persuaded David Riesman that Charles Murray's research was relevant. Wikipedia refers to Riesman's work as:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>An extended report entitled <em>The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure</em> was released in 1979 by David Riesman, professor at the Harvard Department of Economics, and Daniel Kestenholz.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>But Riesman is not a cognitive sciences researcher. The only thing Kestenholza does, in the paper he cites Riesman as having written, is use IQ as a category for further study. There's no mention of Murray's research, and no clear indication that Riesman would have known of it or read it. He's not exactly an impartial source, either.</p><br><p>As far as I can tell, <em>The Bell Curve</em> wasn't just a one-off study or a small investigation of Murray's work, and wasn't mentioned by anyone as having a decisive or even even significant impact on the field of IQ research. Apparently intelligence researchers and the mainstream media took Murray and Riesman's findings about the US distribution of IQ at face value.</p><br><p>It seems incredibly implausible, and very hard to believe that it could have gone through this long. I don't see any obvious flaw in what Riesman and Murray found, or where they went wrong. Why didn't anyone in the field point out that Murray's claim was wrong, and that Riesman's and Herrnstein's claims about the distribution of IQ couldn't possibly be true?</p><br><p>How have so many intellectual elites been so wrong so many times, on such an important question? What have they been doing when they think about "the secret of high intelligence"? How many people in their field just don't pay attention to anything that doesn't have a large impact on their beliefs about human intelligence?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
