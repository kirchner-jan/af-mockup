What I think most rationalists would agree on is their desire to be rational when it comes to forming true beliefs. However, they can go a different extreme in forming their value, by being extremely rigorous in the rational pursuit of making themselves smarter and more self-aware. The Less Wrong community is extremely anti-indoctrination, and wants to keep its members, and the people it interacts with, from having their beliefs and values polluted by outside influences. It seems to me that their approach to that problem can also lead to a rather extreme anti-indoctornation, in which it is considered inappropriate to have children who do not have exposure to what some would consider <em>indoctrination</em> (ie, exposure to other-optimizing beliefs and values). I have two points:</p><br><ul>
<li>Rationalists should be wary of <em>indoctrinating</em> high school students – particularly with beliefs that will directly effect things like their personality.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In my view, high school students do not have the mental capacity to handle the vast amounts of misinformation in the world, and also do not have the ability to form the internalized habits necessary to avoid "self-indoctorination". I do not believe their goals are served by keeping them from the internet, and especially from a "bad" social media.</li>
</ul><br><p>I was inspired to write this post because of the fact that a high school math teacher and student are under investigation for sexual assault, because of the number of teenagers who are obsessed with YouTube videos or celebrities who are accused of sexual assault, and because of my own research on narcissism and the youth. I did not know how to form the evidence to address many of these issues, so I've chosen what I think are the most difficult areas to discuss. These points do not address the broader question of whether it is in fact a good idea to keep kids from learning about sexuality, race, or even the more extreme conspiracy theories. I believe most people would agree with keeping them away from that stuff. The issue I am mostly addressing is the specific issue of being anti-indoctructing high school students by keeping them away from social media, YouTube, celebrity sex scandals, and conspiracy theories.</p><br><p>There may be a generalization here, but when I tried to think through the general idea I found myself having a hard time coming up with something more general that would still address the issue of whether teenage girls and boys need to be exposed to an unusually high level of misinformation to prepare them for their adult life. Please give me some feedback if you know of something I missed.</p><br><p>The first point is that I expect a high percentage of teenagers who read this post not to read it. After reading the title of the post, it seems pretty clear that I am recommending that high school students be allowed to be exposed to the "good" internet, ie, the web that leads them to rationality and the things which will help them become a better person. There would be nothing wrong with an adult getting them into the "bad" internet. But the rational thing is to try to get them to the "good", rather than the "bad" part.</p><br><p>With regards to an adult getting a child into the "good" side, I expect it to go quite badly. It is not hard to argue, given the rational and anti-indoctorsnation nature of the LW group, that if children want to use a web to promote an ideology (even if they don't get indoctrinated) that is probably a bad idea. But I think a better solution is just to raise them to be rational. I think this does happen somewhat when parents and teachers promote the idea of being rational. I would say they "self-indoctorate" them, but I'm not sure if that's the right word. So I think if the same child came across rational memes from an outside source (which was very likely given the LW network) the parents would be the one who was responsible for spreading misinformation. As far as I can tell there is no group of people who would have much success at raising rational children in such a way that I would consider the children not susceptible (i.e. they are not being indoctored) to ideas that would get them to do bad things later.</p><br><p>What's the worst thing that can happen as a result of being exposed to the "bad" side of the web? Well that depends on the child. One obvious possibility is that it could turn the child into a "creep" or sexual predator. This would be due to the "bad", sex related, meme that would be spread by the "bad" website. A less obvious possibility is narcissism, which I think could be caused by the "bad", narcissism related meme.</p><br><p>The most important thing is to be sure this information doesn't change a child's basic, underlying personality. I think rationality is what we know best about human psychology, and rationality has been proven to have very few drawbacks. An important implication of this is that a child _can't _become a narcissist if it's not already one. It is not a necessary result of rationality. So any change in this child's personality must be due to exposure to the "bad internet". If parents can ensure that the child has not been exposed to the "wrong" information, then it's easy to see how a child would be safe. Any "change" that happens is not due to rationality, it's due to the influence of the "wrong" site. If a child is able to keep themselves away from the "wrong" web site, and still become the same child, all the more rational they would appear to be.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
