"You mean like we have rituals in our community? You have rites and rituals?"<em>A brief pause.</em>  "We have <em>brazaras,</em> yes..."</p><br><p><em>Oh-oh, _thought David Graeber's common sense; _you know, things like, "We have this really complex and confusing ceremony where the high priest's brother plays the drums, and there's one thing where you take away a chicken and stuff, and you shout at the sky, and we do this thing where you stand on top of this pyramid and we take turns chanting things at each other."</em></p><br><p>There is a long tradition of people trying to get an inside look at their religions.</p><br><p>You can say you're trying to understand your own religion, but I don't think you ever truly understood how religion works unless you realized that the priests are following orders that they've received from their priests, and the same process is followed every time the high priest prays in his private apartment on his private rooftop and offers his sacred animal sacrifice to Yahweh and all the other gods, there's a little tape recorder somewhere inside the prayer's head, and the priests who've been trained by their priestly predecessors to believe that that's what religions are are faithfully reciting back what they hear the tape recorder say.</p><br><p>I don't know if the Mayan priests could actually <em>see</em> the tape recorder inside their own heads. I guess a sufficiently advanced artificial intelligence could "see" all that sort of thing, and would be able to play a part in, say, the ritual that leads the entire Mayan civilization down into its watery grave...</p><br><pre><code>  -- David Graeber
</code></pre><br><p><em>-- "Meditations on Moloch: Religion's Claim to be Non-Disprovable"</em></p><br><p>When I first decided to embark upon a long endeavor of rationality\xe2\x80\x94a series of posts which might be called a sequence or some similar-sounding phrase, but I prefer the name "rationality" to match the meaning I have in mind, for the sake of convenience\xe2\x80\x94</p><br><p><em>-- then one of the posts I initially intended to write was a "How to Actually Change Your Mind."</em></p><br><p>I'm <em>not</em> going to actually change my "beliefs."  I know too much about how human minds process thoughts to even have hope of changing them; I'm a self-help guru, I work with the same human minds I would otherwise try to improve.</p><br><p>Nonetheless...</p><br><p>You can see what I'm getting at if you try to visualize the difference between <em>The All-Important Art</em> of rationality\xe2\x80\x94"The Way of Bayescraft that lets you think clearly, to win"\xe2\x80\x94_versus_ "How to Actually Fix Your Mind: Pick One Thing You Want to Achieve and Actually Do It."  It's <em>important</em>, and it might even be worth mentioning the word "rationality" and "winning," but in the end, you still want to actually <em>achieve</em> something.</p><br><p>So... </p><br><p>If you're reading this blog, I'm confident you're at least <em>somewhat</em> capable of taking the time to learn a <em>new skill</em> which you can then apply to a <em>real-world</em> problem. We've already talked about the importance of trying to make <em>your</em> rationality <em>transmissible</em>, without making <em>my</em> rationality <em>transmissive</em>. But this can still be useful:  It matters on <em>some</em> level that you've really <em>learned</em> how to turn knowledge into rationality. If you're capable of taking time to learn rationality, I expect your friends to start saying, "Hey, did you hear the one about so-and-so?" and you smile, and say, "Oh yes, that one."</p><br><p>It really is important to learn how to do it yourself. And just as it takes an awful lot of time to become competent in a domain like math, you really <em>should</em> try to learn how to use rationality as if it were a new skill\xe2\x80\x94because actually learning it <em>is</em> a new skill.</p><br><p>I'm beginning to suspect that it is easier to <em>demonstrate</em> one's skills than to <em>learn</em> them\xe2\x80\x94maybe everyone knows the difference, and that the art really is passed down among humans.</p><br><p>Which leaves only one alternative:  You have to actually learn how to use your craft, not just read something nice about it and think it must have been easy...</p><br><p>...because you <em>can</em> make your craft genuinely your own. You can even do so by studying just the one book, <em>How to Actually Change your Mind</em>, which I hope you have now purchased to add to your bookshelves.</p><br><p><em>Note:  I'm still planning to write an "Open-Ended" sequence, but it would happen after the "How to Actually Achieve" sequence.</em></p><br><p>If you've got a sense that there's an "art" there, which you have failed to acquire, and are reading this blog to remind yourself what that art is, then you will be especially interested in my next post, "An Art of Rationality," which will appear after I've outlined what rationality is, and some techniques of rationality.</p><br><pre><code>Next post: "An Art of Winning at Life"
