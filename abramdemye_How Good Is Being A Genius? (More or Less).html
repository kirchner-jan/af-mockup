<li>How smart are people and other factors? </li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>How smart is a really <strong>really</strong> smart person or are those few left in the world rare outliers? </li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>How does intelligence and other factors combine? Are there different types of intelligence or just two very different kinds of genius, the extremely intelligent and the extremely creative? Are there even more possibilities than that? Or does there seem to be one type of intelligence that goes with one type of genius?  </li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>How smart do good geniuses get in the best cases? Are there any people with extraordinary high intelligence in general? </li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>What happens when people mix a really smart person with good ideas or even a "normal" competent high IQ person with good ideas and is it more effective than a person who works hard by themselves and makes an effort? What happens to people with the most talent in combination with the smartest and more experienced, but not super genius? </li>
</ol><br><p>What all of this has to do with Less Wrong's attempts towards rationality and self improvement </p><br><p><em>A note: I have done some research, or done other research on the Internet that was very similar in nature to the question that I asked. I won't try to give an overview of what I did here, for that I feel would be a rather large task, and that I don't feel a big need to do that yet, but I _will</em> be interested to hear the feedback of this Less Wrong community about it. This was done before I started reading Less Wrong, but it certainly would not have happened without that blog! _</p><br><p>How smart are people?</p><br><p>Here is a graph of the IQ test scores of people who took that test:  </p><br><p>There has been some controversy over the results. To a standard of 1 standard deviation, how smart a person actually is, given all that the graph above shows, can vary from 100 to 160. However, I am going to use the average IQ value of 110 for the purposes of this discussion since that's what Robin Hanson cited as the average IQ.</p><br><p>I decided to use that value by two reasons. One is to make sure I'm not talking about something that shouldn't be an IQ test. It is an IQ test because it correlates (and to a lesser extent, predicts) quite well to certain areas outside of IQ, such as education and intelligence, but no more, but that isn't why I used it.</p><br><p>The other reason is that since people who are not highly intelligent sometimes have this IQ value, it could even be that the people at the very bottom are smarter, simply because they cannot follow and express themselves in a given survey of a test. I think the idea is that the smartest people will be able to get to the higher part of the curve and most people of all should be able to see some way of expressing themselves and answer correctly to questions there. But it might also be that even people at the very extreme bottom of an IQ distribution might not have difficulty following along such a curve, but just have low average intelligence.</p><br><p>Anyhow, an average IQ of 110 correlates (to first order approximation) approximately with someone being able to:</p><br><ul>
<li>Hold down a job.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Hold down a relationship.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Hold a conversation.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Finish high school.</li>
</ul><br><p>I want to break this down, because I know smartness is very important in many other endeavors.  </p><br><p>How smart is a good Genius?</p><br><p>If someone is particularly good at a wide variety of tasks, are they really good at all of them (as one might assume?), or just good at one?</p><br><p>For example, if someone is good at chess, does that mean they were good at chess their entire life? Or would that just mean that they started playing chess when they were 10? Or better yet, when they were 10 and their parents were going to play chess with them and the parents made the mistake of putting a chess board somewhere the kid couldn't reach?</p><br><p>Or is it better to use a measure which is in some ways more objective? Like the IQ test? </p><br><p>My suspicion is that good chess players are <em>really good at chess</em>, in that they just get way better when they have the time. But that a very small number of very smart people become masters of a field of study, then get off of that "learning curve" and get stuck on that "chess level" of intelligence forever.</p><br><p>Or, if it is a general intelligence, and being smarter in a particular field doesn't make you smarter in any other fields (it shouldn't or it wouldn't be a general intelligence), then there are very few people with a broad range of intelligence, but a rather narrow ability of intelligence.</p><br><p>I am actually fairly uncertain about this, because I know very little about the world of chess and don't have any intelligent people to test this theory on, but I will offer some evidence for and against this theory just to get a conversation going.</p><br><p>Also, I'll try to find some research and find out about how smart and not so smart people do in other occupations.</p><br><p>How intelligent are good people versus average geniuses? </p><br><p>Some things that might be important factors:</p><br><ul>
<li>The type of work that a person engages in is related to intelligence, but I don't have any idea of how this translates to genius.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How much "time was spent on particular activities such as reading as a child".</li>
</ul><br><p>Another question, as people who are really smart know that IQ isn't the most important factor in one's success, but it is a little more complicated than that. </p><br><p>If somebody is really smart, does that mean that they are really hard working as well as smart or does being smart just mean that you don't need to work as hard as the person who doesn't have extra time but is really intelligent (which makes sense that they could be really intelligent, but not so intelligent that they are able to work harder than others)? </p><br><p>If a person is working really hard, is that evidence for being smart? And if a person is not working hard, but is rather "passing by a good job", is that evidence of being smart?</p><br><p>Also, does that mean a smart person without time to engage in activities is not smart or is just smart in a particular way and it is actually <em>more</em> possible than that to be smart without engaging in activities?</p><br><p>How effective are good genii at getting good jobs and how effective is it to get to that point if you are just smart, but working hard?</p><br><p>Are there any geniuses in the world left over? Or do the people with the most intellectual potential just not manage to become highly intelligent enough to use that intellectual potential to accomplish good things, and they get stuck in their jobs like the rest of us?  </p><br><p>And when it comes to high skill jobs like math, writing and programming, is intelligence such that being smart enough to read everything on the Internet does not make you smart enough to be an amazing writer and amazing programmer? And are these jobs the only ones a sufficiently smart person can do on the Internet (or what if you can read everything on the internet)? </p><br><p>Is there a trade off?</p><br><p>I am tempted to say there is, because if you are super smart, you are going to spend less time on certain activities. But the question is if you are smart enough to not take the time to read, but are still smart enough to succeed in something you should be smart enough to find the right job.</p><br><p>Alternatively, maybe the trade off is that if you read, you learn, and you are smart enough and work hard enough, and you do the right things, then you may even be able to get yourself to the point where you work hard at something on the Internet. And again, if you are still reading lots of stuff here, I wonder if you shouldn't be really smart so that you can do better.</p><br><p>But this trade off is also something that I have been thinking about, and I have decided not to buy the whole "a genius is someone who is stupid in the traditional sense" theory for now since I don't know the answer to the question yet.  I will continue researching it, but for now this post is already getting too long and I feel like I am still left with some good questions to discuss (some of which I am having trouble pinning down yet. Like why do IQ tests still exist?). </p><br><p>But when I try to think about it more, maybe there is something there. Maybe you are getting better at your specific tasks as you study and get better at everything else, but you are never going to be the type of super genius who is good at everything.</p><br><p>And yet if there is one thing that the best chess players have and they were the type of people who would become chess players instead of a couple of good teachers or whatever, I would bet that they would get super good at chess.  </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
