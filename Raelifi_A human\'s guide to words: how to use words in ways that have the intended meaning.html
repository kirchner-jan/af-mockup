A _meaning _is the purpose for which a person created a word.</p><br><p>What people who insist the <em>meaning</em> of words is different from the <em>letter-and-spaces</em> inside their skull misunderstand is that they're trying to read into the word meanings the structure, order, and purpose of the words themselves.</p><br><p>They're reading "the meaning of" and "in what sense can" as though they were the nouns in a sentence and are to be found in the subject. It's not because they want to give their interpretations of the meanings of words, or use them to argue from semantics to metasemantics, but because they think that meanings are somehow more _meaningful _than the meanings are.</p><br><p>And the reason that they think that is because the letters and spaces of a word are immutable, whereas the meaning isn't. They believe they can change a word by, I don't know, adding a word or swapping out a letter\xe2\x80\x94some strange, weird belief they carry around for <em>just that reason,</em> <em>because</em> <em>meaning's supposed to be mutable but not letter-and-space.</em></p><br><p>But words are really just made of letters and spaces, like any other sequence of letters and spaces. If I type the letters "mean" you have now received the word "mean". This is the same thing as typing "bog" and getting out "bog". If that letter that just showed up wasn't there, I can't be "out of the bog".</p><br><p>The only difference is that meanings are more like a <em>determined purpose</em> as words are. Like a word meaning is a <em>purpose</em> as a bog is a determined amount of water.</p><br><p>And word-meanings, purposes, are not like the internal state they are created in. Meaning-permanence is not like the impermanence of internal states because even permanency is a determined purpose just as purposefulness is by definition.</p><br><p>To understand the word meaning as being created by the particular purpose for which the word is used in is the root of the problem with them. If they _don't know _their words don't _mean _anything _specific _then what's the point of trying to use them instead of a dictionary?</p><br><p>To explain why dictionary definitions fail to satisfy this purpose I'll first need to talk about the process by which I came to that realization.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
