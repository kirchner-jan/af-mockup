If you haven't already read the "Politics and the English Language" sequence, do so now before reading this. Also skip any discussion of specific candidates, and read it in that order. You should also know that I am in favor of open source in general, and of all three main political organizations in the Sequences._)</p><br><p><strong>I.</strong></p><br><p>There is an old joke that "I love you, but I don't love you yet" is a prerequisite for love.</p><br><p>It's true: people who say those words out loud to each other tend to get married later in life. Someone who feels like saying "I love you" to a potential mate is more likely to say "I love you but I don't think you're serious enough about me to be my wife/\xe2\x80\x8bex-wife/\xe2\x80\x8bpartners in a polyamorous relationship/\xe2\x80\x8bromantic interest." They are less likely to say "Oh sure, sure. Of course I love you, but maybe one day I'll change my mind, and not love you any more".</p><br><p>If you don't tell someone you love them while you're still in the middle of saying "no", on the other hand, they can't feel loved (or at least, they can only feel loved for a short time before being inundated with proposals from hopeful suitors). The saying "I love, but" is an artifice of polite society. It is constructed like this because it is useful: to give people an out for not wanting the hassle of a proposal and the responsibility and financial strain of saying "I love but" in a "serious" relationship. If someone says "I love,but I'd love to marry this guy instead" then you're free to say "okay, sure, I'm happy to talk about it" but if they say "yes, I love" you can just pass.</p><br><p>I don't mean to say "but": "I love you a lot". "I love you to pieces and pieces". Saying "love" in that tone of voice is a big commitment. I would rather go down to breakfast with friends and not be tempted away by the prospect of marrying this guy, but since I do want to marry him eventually, but I doni want to commit now and I'd rather wait a few years and explore the world first, I will commit now in the spirit that commitment.</p><br><p>In the same way as committing to not be jealous if you want someone to fall in love with you, committing to not be in love but to say "I've lost interest in you after X date" gives your relationship a chance to grow and flourish while you still have your "interest" in the other person. In the same way, "I love" means that you are giving something up rather than putting it on and off at your will.</p><br><p>It has also given me a way to talk to girls I like who think I'm weird for not being in love.</p><br><p>"Oh I love you but I would be a huge idiot to fall crazy in love with someone as random as myself", I can say. "I'm sure there's someone out there for me. I just haven't met them yet".</p><br><p>It's a great defense. And with this tactic I've landed a few friends and acquaintances, and managed to get out of several relationship. The girl I'm right now with is the one I was talking to last time. I've lost interest, but I'm not in love. This is a huge relief; I never thought I could have a "friends and acquaintances" relationship because I've always wanted a "LDR" (long-distance relationship).</p><br><p>This was a big part of how I stayed single for so long. I've always wanted to be in love, but I've always been too afraid of being a huge idiot to even <em>seek</em> that kind of relationship. The way this plays out is that I can't have one, so I don't go looking, and I'll never be in love.</p><br><p>Now, I will always be free to be happy with the people I do have relationships with, and I'm sure I can always find someone better than the people I'm currently dating but for some reason the lack of a long-distance relationship just makes me miserable.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>So, on the one hand, rationalists are often associated with the phrase "open source movement" because of the famous Less Wrong code forked from OpenStreetMap.</p><br><p>Rationalists use that phrase because they want to keep their identity separate from the community of "rationalists", to be free of the peer pressure of the wider rationality community. On the other hand they often seem to <em>be</em> the community of "reasonable" people, and the more extreme members of that community they view with condescension.</p><br><p>In <em>The Map and the Territory</em> Eliezer makes the case that there is one big set of beliefs out there, and that "rationalist" or "EA" stand-in for "rationalist/\xe2\x80\x8begalitarian" or even for "person in a certain reference frame". On the other hand, much of Less Wrong seems to him to come from a tendency to have different reference frames for similar concepts, and to see how you can apply each set of reference frames to a particular thing in order to prove it was a "rational" thing to do or a "good" thing to do.</p><br><p>The OpenStreetMap fork is a perfect example of this. The original OpenStreetMap project was an experiment, just a project by one group to see if they could crowd-source a really useful mapping project. Less Wrong was a result, not a purpose. So if someone takes the OpenStreetMap code and runs with it, this is not an act of defiance by the LW community, but the most natural thing in the world.</p><br><p>But if someone with an activist attitude looks at an OpenStreetMap fork, it's one more reason to dismiss the project as a rationalist one.</p><br><p>When was the last time you thought about why you were making a conscious decision to support or oppose something? I'll wager you never did. Not like this\xe2\x80\x94you didn't even notice.</p><br><p>But these are the kinds of decisions you can make if you're aware what you're doing. You can be genuinely curious about the benefits and drawbacks of a movement. You can be mindful of who you're talking to, and how your actions affect the person, and the world around them. You can look at the real world and see if there are any obvious consequences, and then look at the predictions you make based on these consequences and see if they're right. You can make decisions in the spirit of doing what you need to do to get out of the woods as quickly as possible, instead of the spirit of helping someone or changing the world.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
