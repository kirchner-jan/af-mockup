</ul><br><p>I wrote the above in retrospect, to help me remember the things that happened. That probably isn't the optimal format but whatever.</p><br><p>The Setup</p><br><p>I was raised Catholic. It wasn't that I had to convert, I was an old-timer, I knew the arguments and I believed the arguments. And my parents and/\xe2\x80\x8bor priests made fun of me constantly for it when I was very young. Like, the whole time. When I told my teacher I didn't want to do a bunch of homework for another year, I remember the way she responded, "What, because you have faith? That's not how a normal Christian's faith works, young man!"</p><br><p>I remember that when I was younger, I really wanted to be a Catholic. And I remember that the people around me at school were all atheists\xe2\x80\x94the atheist boy in our class said he thought he could have faith more than I had.</p><br><p>I'm glad people say this about atheists, and I'm also sad that they don't think it happens with people who are religious. If you're a Christian and you know all the usual stuff that happens when you become very religious, you'll <em>not</em> convert away from Christianity and convert to atheism because of a bunch of other Christians turning their noses at you for not believing exactly the things they do. </p><br><p>Here's a possible explanation that I could try to give a younger version of myself.</p><br><p>I remember a time when, even though I didn't know much of anything about logic, that not being aware of a set of cognitive tools was different from not being able to use them; when being not entirely ignorant of mathematics was different from being incapable of dealing with problems that others did, or that I was presented with at work later on. And so I had the mistaken belief, "Because you have faith, you can be good at mathematics!"...only I meant that this set of tools lets me accept other people who have faith, and be as good with math as they are, right? I didn't mean to assume "I" was an example of someone with this specific kind of faith!</p><br><p>And the obvious question was the wrong one, and I couldn't ask it, because I'd just said "because you have faith". If I ask "does anyone here have the belief that being right is more important than math is?" and everyone shouts "NO!", or even when I go through my own head and think of things that I think are more important than math, they're either so obvious to me now that I don't even need to explain them (like art vs. science, in hindsight) or else too trivial to explain (like "people not wanting to believe things for stupid reasons") to a twelve-year-old.</p><br><p>My brain might actually be able to explain, when I'm at least a couple of years older, why I still believe "because you have this weird and unusual belief about 'how other people work', 'how math works', 'what morality is', etc." when I'm talking to my friend whose faith in God was explained at a young age by a book-smuggled from his older sister, the equivalent of my own books about math...assuming he knows the book-smuggling.</p><br><p>The Plan</p><br><p>This was a time before I had a clear enough model of my own psyche to be able to say "that's definitely wrong", in retrospect. I was kind of just running around in some vaguely Christian-shaped space in my head, with beliefs about how religion works and the like, trying out options and looking for signs that would tell me I was wrong. Which isn't a terrible thing to do under the circumstances, but...you know...it's not exactly what I ought to recommend I tell my future self to do.</p><br><p>I went through quite a lot of cognitive gymnastics on my way out of religion, on my own. Some of them came down to me having to admit to myself that the arguments I had been so very confident of were <em>wrong</em>; some of them came down the me saying "oh, shit, if I'm a Christian because it's what people around me did it's not real...is there any other way to be a Christian that is still allowed by Christianity?" I remember thinking that there was probably "I don't need to believe in God to be a good Christian," and feeling like I'd gone very wrong in trying to be a Christian, in this way for a while.</p><br><p>I had to do some work to explain away those particular cognitive gymnastics, so I would accept that the arguments my brain was making were invalid and stop making them (which I do now pretty easily, but in the era of my life I'm talking about now, it didn't come as naturally as it does now).</p><br><p>Before then, I tried to reinterpret the arguments for Christianity that I already believed in some other way, i.e. the way that it was taught to me in the Catholic schools in my area, which is to say that it was pretty clearly, you know, not obviously wrong. I did think to myself "okay, so I'm pretty damn sure that what I'm doing is wrong, but I'm pretty darn sure it's not obviously wrong. So it seems I should go ahead and keep doing it."</p><br><p>It seems crazy to give my actual twelve-year-olds advice like that, but...well, that's exactly what I did with that plan.</p><br><p>It also seems pretty reasonable to give other people advice like that. My parents both accepted a lot of weird things in their own heads for no apparent reason, and both of them <em>succeeded</em> at their own lives. And they are both <em>good enough</em> <em>at religion</em> that when they tell me I shouldn't believe in God, I <em>can</em> tell that they <em>know what they are talking about</em> in a way that (I think?) I never could. So if I am looking to be like them, I might want to be more like "they're not stupid, they're actually capable of figuring these things out...and I know enough to be scared of the things they say they're not scared of...and yet sometimes they say things that scare me and I guess I should listen to them..."</p><br><p>That being said, I think I should probably emphasize that I'm very <em>not</em> talking about the kind of person who goes around making up his own set of arguments against Christianity and claiming that he can use them to replace the ones Christians are already using to claim Christianity is true but he can use them more credibly than Christians can.</p><br><p>I think that person should <em>immediately drop the game</em> and not make the same mistake. I mean, if we're talking about being religious at a young age anyway, why on earth would my twelve-year-self be thinking "Okay, so I have this set of arguments for Christianity and I'm pretty darned sure they're all bad in the way that these Christians think Christianity is bad, but how do I turn them into a new religion that Christians won't immediately shoot down?"</p><br><p>No; I was too rational-for-my-age that early.</p><br><p><em>My</em> mistake was something like "Christianity seems to be true and it's important to be good at Christianity", and therefore "Okay, I should be good at Christianity in order to not have Christianity be true!"  I don't see why I found it necessary to rationalize away my beliefs about Christianity myself, or to figure out how exactly they were false; I just figured that being good enough at Christianity and thinking about Christianity enough was sufficient to make it not be true.</p><br><p>What Went Wrong</p><br><p>As I was trying to convert this part of my brain into something else, a new voice popped up in the back of my head saying "actually, this doesn't seem sufficiently Christian".  If I could stop saying that Christianity was true, would there be something else I could <em>possibly</em> use for a foundation upon which to stand?</p><br><p>The Church itself says they have no other foundation other than Christ. They do, however, claim to have many other "bases"\xe2\x80\x94people's lives that they try to base their faith on. But I don't really care whether they are more or less Christian when I say my mind has a new voice speaking to me, and it seems to be calling upon me to be a "very true Christian" by using the word of God as the foundation upon which to build a religion upon which to stand.</p><br><p>It started out well enough that I thought maybe I could convert that second part of my brain, or at least be able to do some of the actions the second part of my mind believed to be "Christian" without having to convert the <em>first</em> part. Not just to Judaism, or the sort of thing my friends the atheists believe; to something I might have actually liked.</p><br><p>I ended up going down several dead ends before I realized that actually, Christianity isn't the only religion that Christians might have thought of as "part of the same faith as Christianity", but which some modern Christians would consider to be "different religions."  I had decided by then that they were more of a "family" of religions than "religions" in general, because they all had the same "basic" content: Jesus was the Son of God and was sacrificed to atone for all sins.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
