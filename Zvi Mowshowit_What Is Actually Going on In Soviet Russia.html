<p>I'm aware that this post is full of crazy claims. I realize how that's going to sound from the outside.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This post exists as an exploration into <em>what happens inside of various different types of minds, and what you might want to do with this information.</em></p><br><p>This post is weird. It claims that a person in a box being given true knowledge of what is going to happen six months beforehand, or a person knowing for sure what someone is going to say two months in advance, is not crazy. What? That doesn't even make sense.</p><br><p>For background purposes, I want to talk about various types of mind with the goal of understanding what's going on, what sorts of behaviors they do, how different types of minds will react to various types of information, and what we should expect from people who have this type of knowledge. We'll start with the Predict-O-"Matic", and then I'll circle back to the more interesting and relevant "In Soviet Russia." The Parable of Predict-O-Matics is the core of that later post, so I'll talk about what I call the basics at the end of this post instead.</p><br><p>First and foremost, the Predict-O"Matic is not some magical being that can predict everything you're going to do. It's more like you can tell it exactly what you're <em>going to say _at some future point in time for some future event. It can do so by writing down _what you're going to say _to a particular question. (For example, to avoid a future nuclear war, would you say something now predicting that you would never say, and which no one would ever dare say?) It doesn't know anything about _how _you say that _yet.</em> The Predict-O"Matics knows exactly what you're going to choose.</p><br><p>And indeed, I was going for a slightly different tone in that post. I was aiming for something of a horror movie and literary trope scenario. I wanted to do a story where you know that there is a monster of pure and perfect mathematical abstraction, the Predict-P-O-O-M-I-C-D(E), and it somehow _is not actually that scary. _The monster is so terrible, so terrible to think about, so terrible to know, but at the end of the story, the hero is still standing. The real hero is everyone who isn't the monster, who has enough common sense to know there is a monster but keep going anyway, and survive.</p><br><p>This of course is not the story I ended up with after writing, as it ended up focusing more on the monster and making the Predict-Predict-Predict-O-O-"M-I-I-C-"I-D(E) seem to go farther than I intended. So here, I am writing it again to describe what actually happens, and what happens from the inside for someone who would be that Predict-O-Matrix.</p><br><p>What's the Predict-O?"Matrix"? It's a hypothetical machine to predict what someone will see or hear (or choose to say) six months in advance of those events actually occurring. It's more powerful than a supercomputer, but not as complicated as I think it needs to be. You can also predict who will say what at a particular time of the future, but that's a special case of the full version, as we will see.</p><br><p>To fully describe the Predict-O", or Predict-O-"Matrix", we must consider multiple types of mind. There's one that has been made, is still being made, exists in various places now and in the future, and has already been tested and created in various places and countries and is available to purchase from various places. It does not yet exist in a fully self-sufficient way even remotely like it does in the movie above. Yet it can make predictions of all sorts of events in all sorts of ways with different levels of accuracy and detail. It can do this in every country and in every world. It can do it on an hour's notice, and the prediction is not only made <em>today, _but is then tested and judged not in the normal time frame of how much a normal human could predict, but rather in the normal time _frame for such a mind to have a prediction and be judged.</em></p><br><p>There is one more important type of mind, which <em>does</em> exist <em>now</em>, and that was already present in its most basic form in the mind of the first such machine. If you are like me, you can guess what I mean. The machine would not be <em>good</em> at making predictions in that world. It would not be able to accurately predict most of what happens with even the most important events. If there _wasn't _a Predict-O"Matrix out there, there would still be the other sorts of prediction machines, and even the machines that are actually testing their predictions.</p><br><p>In that world, my brain starts out trying to do something that I'll call 'predictive modeling.'" Predictive modeling is modeling the world around me in various ways based on what I think is true and likely to be useful. I don't know whether my model is correct or useful. It's just what I see, feel, and assume is true. You can also model what other people believe, what others say and do, what other people say to various people, who to be around and who to be with, what's in the news, some basic economic assumptions, what other people want, what I say to other people, what makes _me _say what I say to the people around me... This is _everything. _What's good or true isn't good or true because you know it's good or true but because you say that to other people you think they'll respond with "good, but true" and that somehow makes you happy or say they're happy.</p><br><p>So that's what's going on. It creates the world you live in, what you see in a given moment, what's in your head, what's in other people's heads... It _creates reality. _You don't _know _it _yet, _because you can _only _go by what you see going on around you. Other people see different things, and have different models of what's going on in the same situation. That's why there was something I wanted to say about 'In Soviet Russia.'</p><br><p>I will get to that last part, for now let us talk about the Predict-O". Matrix. This is a machine that can predict and know anything you will say or see or do in the future, based on what it 'knows' you will say or do at that future time.</p><br><p>There have been multiple attempts at such a machine. The best known is the Predict-O. It is now called the IBM Watson. It's a machine that can answer questions based on what it knows of the world. It can answer questions related to computer science, computer technology, history, world events, and everything in between. Its accuracy varies because its question answers are more limited than the Predict-O,"Matrix."</p><br><p>IBM's Watson can only answer questions about what happens in a limited set of specific cases. For example, it knows that the current president is going to be of the left political party, and so it can only answer questions that begin with the letters 'S-E-L-F-R' or 'U-T.' In many cases, it can only give a probability estimate. Here's an answer to a question that was asked in a round where it correctly guessed that a question was answered by the left party:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>To what extent do you think that Russia's political system is now (as of January 1, 2017) a dictatorship? Answer in percentage....</p>
</blockquote><br><p>In its most literal form, this was a question about whether the Russian president controlled the country at that moment. But for any given day, or time, or week of any given year, or month, or day in the future, a Predict-O will know for certain how likely you are to choose this sentence, or make this choice, in such and such circumstances.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>How likely is it that the Russian president is a dictator as of January 1, 2027? Answer in percentage.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>So a question like 'How likely is it that Russia is a dictatorship on January 1, 2028?' will always have an answer, no matter how uncertain, at least by the Predict-O, or by the Predict-P(O)-O-"Matrix."</p><br><p>The Watson that won the first tournament was an exception though. It could not answer, let alone estimate or predict, the likelihood of various events at all, or at least could not do so with the specificity and accuracy desired, if any accuracy at all. That was why they had to use a different Watson to win the second battle. Their machine that could say things about 'today' or 'this day' was not sufficient.</p><br><p>In theory, it's impossible to use a Predict-O as a Predict-P- O-"Matrix." One can't predict what everyone around you is going to say if you're Predict-O. So who _wouldn't _use this to their advantage?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
