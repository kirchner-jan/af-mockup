</ul><br><p>In March of 2019, I started an ambitious project: figure out what I'm missing when it comes to being more strategic, improving my productivity, living a happier life. The post I wrote for LW was the first step I took. And then a month or so later, an old idea came up that helped me better understand what I'm missing here. The second step is to make good use of those insights.</p><br><p>In the next couple of posts, I'll walk through examples of the "problem" I identified, how I could have been using those insights in the first place, and what I decided to do different. But before I do that, it's worth asking an obvious question: why did I decide to make this project a priority in the first place? Why all of this time and attention?</p><br><p>I don't know. It felt important. It was fun because learning new things always is, so I figured that's probably enough to get started. I probably wasn't the right person to take this on\xe2\x80\x94maybe I should take on fewer projects like this, since there's a much higher chance I'll fail than succeed. But I think I'm going to move forward with this project.</p><br><p>This post is also cross-posted on my personal blog.</p><br><p>My hope is that by explaining what I did wrong, and how I fixed it, you'll find yourself more effective in your own lives too.</p><br><p>In conclusion</p><br><p>"When my alarm goes...</p><br><ul>
<li>First, at 4 AM, I make an appointment with my doctor to go back to her office that same day at 6 AM.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Then at 4:15 AM, even though my alarm hasn't actually gone off, I put on some socks and grab my phone, hoping to text my wife or check messages. The actual alarm goes off at 4:45 AM, but by then whatever tasks need to be done have already been done.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I get on the train at 5:15, and am at my appointment by 5:45. So that's my alarm and my wife's alarm going off, and everything's just on schedule."</li>
</ul><br><p>(Source: This LW comment by ChrisHallquist)</p><br><p>"__"When my alarm went off at 5:30 in the morning, I made sure to set the alarm for another 30 minutes, and then took the first thing I could think to turn on the radio to play something while I was getting ready for the day.</p><br><p>"__"I have lots of habits, as you'll see later in the post, that have nothing to do with productivity. But I think they're useful habits to have so there was something rational behind them starting out, even if they were kind of arbitrary. Once I started thinking of each one as an arbitrary habit, I was like, "I should probably just take all the good habits and only let bad habits creep in, but I'm having too much fun right now!""</p><br><p>"<strong>"This is one of the most productive things I do each day, when I can manage to stick to it. I use it to stay focussed for hours."</strong></p><br><p>The idea is simple. Every week, choose one of the following actions to increase your productivity (i.e. exercise, do creative writing, finish projects, work on your dissertation). The purpose of this post is to explain how I came up with this idea, what habits worked out, and how I think about and implement these actions in my own daily life. I hope they'll help you to make better use of your own time too.</p><br><p>By the end of this post, you'll have enough research to say "I can't really see what value _I'm _missing by doing these actions", but hopefully at least one of the actions you chose to take will make enough sense to you that you _can _say "Well, sure, I can't see this as actually being an effective use of my time, but I just can't think of a way to avoid doing it."</p><br><p><strong>"I can't see how research could be relevant to this particular problem..."?</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>"Well, maybe it's just a bad use of your time and effort. In which case, I just can't figure out how it might be a good use of my time and effort."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"Well yeah. I never actually ask myself that question. And my calendar is full, so I'm never going to get it done now anyway."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"Yeah, I guess when I finally do look through my calendar to see if it's actually true that I need to do this right now, it seems like I usually already spend a bunch of time doing it? Maybe some small chunk of time from now might be a good time to try to do it"</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>My (failed) search for research that might help me, and what I discovered</strong></p><br><p>"A couple of the things I already know..."</p><br><ul>
<li>To get more done in the same chunk of time, do lots of the same thing repeatedly. So for instance, it might be useful to walk to the gym each morning instead of waiting for the shower first.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>"The value of being wrong for 20 years..."</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>Make a bunch of stuff, notice problems, try to figure out why the problems exist. As opposed to trying to make one thing at a time, and running into problems immediately when you try to apply it.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>The problem with this is that research is slow.</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>To make use of my time to increase productivity, I will need to figure out what research might help me. That typically involves a) a lot of time spent reading /\xe2\x80\x8b skimming old blog posts, academic papers, and Google Scholar papers by other people; b) a lot of brainstorming, which is a lot like making things up and then seeing if there's some sort of thing. And c) time spent asking myself, "is there a way to make things more efficient here than x, y, z?" </li>
</ul><br><p><strong>"When my morning routine goes right, I end up exercising, writing, and showering before I get to work."</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>If it feels right to get up and do something that helps me stay focused, then I will naturally want to do something like that. So I might try writing or exercising or showering <em>on different days</em>.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>"I think I have quite a high level of productivity..."</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>This is a strong claim. So I should be skeptical. I think it's probably the case that even if I don't ask myself the question "What can you do today to increase your _current _intellectual productivity?" it's still pretty likely that some way the research I do for this blog project can be applied to my problem-solving in my day-to-day life.</li>
</ul><br><p>"<strong>"You can't make plans on day X... </strong></p><br><ul>
<li>If my schedule is still full tomorrow, I can't make any plans for tomorrow.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>... unless it's for research...</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>One thing I've tried to do this year is try to do research with an open ended project where there's no clear stopping point of the project\xe2\x80\x94I either succeed or I don't. And this was helpful for a couple of weeks, but it's now become clear that once I'm writing things down and brainstorming solutions and trying to think of things that have potential value, that's where things are at the end of the day.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>My time here is spent waiting on Google to resolve the question "is the most effective way to spend my time reading academic papers on things like personal productivity?".  </strong></p><br><ul>
<li>So the best place to put that research time would be doing something else. But there's something about the value of not having to go through that process myself that makes it worthwhile to just ask it of Google. Because at the end of it all, Google's likely going to tell you a whole lot more about personal productivity than you want to know.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>"...from day X \xe2\x88\x92 1"</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>When I notice something that my research agenda does not capture, then that's usually a sign that my agenda might be better if it were to start earlier. Because there's something I'm missing.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>"My task list is full up to day X-1, and now that I've found a better way to break it down into smaller chunks, it'll only take me a couple hours."</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>I have a pretty good amount of time in a day and don't often feel like I don't have time to do something. The fact that task X feels overwhelming is usually a sign that task X is better broken into more pieces or into more parts and that those parts will probably fit into a short amount of time.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>"I don't see... </strong></p><br><ul>
<li>The value of taking any action in isolation, where I don't have any idea if it will help me or not. I might be missing some important step here that only shows up after a bunch of research or experimentation.</li>
