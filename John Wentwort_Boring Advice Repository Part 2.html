First, I'm going to outline my takeaways, then list the advice I saw, then include a link to each article in the order I looked through it (sorted roughly by how recently I found it).</p><br><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><br><p>If someone tells you to "be more empathetic" or "be more altruistic", check if they're actually referring to something you <em>do</em> already do. Try to give concrete, concrete examples; when I try this, the most "in-the-box" examples I can think of are "Be empathetic to people in the same position as me" or "Be altruistic towards poor people" which might be vague but are at least <em>defined</em>. If someone tells you to be "more altruistic", be more specific: "more specifically towards poor people" or "more specifically towards the Third World", or "more specifically, and in more detail...", and so on. If you find a vague "be more altruist" and can still think of specific examples (in your head), I bet <em>most</em> of the "altruism" advice is actually just being more altruistic.</p><br><p>When someone tells you "you don't have to worry about being liked by people, they're wrong", they probably want you to worry <em>even more</em> about whether somebody might feel <em>even more</em> compelled to dislike you.</p><br><p>If someone says "you never have to try hard", check whether they actually wanted you to "always try hard", or just "try hard enough"/\xe2\x80\x8b"not have to worry about it much".</p><br><p>If somebody says "you shouldn't focus too much on your own desires", check whether they want you to "give up your own preferences" in favour of other people's (in which case consider whether it's worth it).</p><br><p>If somebody says you can "stop listening to other voices in your head" or "do whatever you want for now", check if they actually want to "stop doing what you want", or whether they just want you to take their advice because they can't think of anything better.</p><br><p>If you feel you're too "self-centered", consider if they're just <em>wishing</em> you were more self-centered or if they actually have suggestions for how you could (and should) do that.</p><br><p>If somebody tells you to "try to learn from everyone else", check whether they just want to "learn what other people thought" or want you to actually do something useful with that information.</p><br><p>If somebody says that people are hypocrites, consider what sort of hypocrisy they're talking about. Be wary of people who claim that they're trying to be truthful when they do (or when they suggest doing) things that seem dishonest or manipulative. And also be wary of people who tell you to ignore the fact that people you consider "the enemy" are actually doing things for your own benefit.</p><br><p>If someone tells us to "be more self-reliant", then check whether they're actually referring just to "not depend on external sources of money" or whether they may also want us to be less interdependent with others. If they're just saying that, think less of them.</p><br><p>If somebody advises us to "think more about the bigger picture", we might assume that they want us to "think less about ourselves" to the point of thinking about a small number of things without really learning anything new, but I suspect they're actually just trying to tell us to <em>think more broadly</em>.</p><br><p><strong>The Advice</strong></p><br><p>So far, "boring" has been a catch-all term that means "actually useful but not obvious"\xe2\x80\x94what follows are some examples, by no means necessarily from any one person in particular.</p><br><p><strong>Advice I Listened To, But Didn't Take</strong></p><br><p>If someone says, "You're not alone!" or "Don't feel the need to keep any other voice in your head"</p><br><p><strong>Advice Given by Several People</strong></p><br><p>A lot of LW-esque advice is <em>very</em> similar\xe2\x80\x94the distinction is that each of the authors in some cases go further with specific examples, in some cases suggest specific things one can do to put advice into practice, and in some cases suggest ways that people could get more accurate ideas of what they "should" be doing.</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>A note on LW culture</strong>\xe2\x80\x94If you're the sort of person who would keep a "should" in your head, try to figure out what it actually means. If they want you to think about the "big picture", check if it has a specific example in mind. If someone wants you to "stop listening to your own voices in your head", consider whether they want you "to hear someone else's (more accurate) voice in your head". If someone tells you "everybody wants you to care about other people", ask whether they really just want you to care about people in the same situations you do, or actually care about <em>other</em> people.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>If you want to be more altruistic/\xe2\x80\x8bempathetic/\xe2\x80\x8baltruistic/\xe2\x80\x8bself-reliant...</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>If being "less self-centered" means forgetting your own preferences (at least sometimes) or giving up on your own happiness (at least sometimes)...</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Try to learn from the people around you, if you're able to.</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Consider that the default assumption is that if you ask a teacher something, the teacher will try to give you a good answer... but that probably doesn't mean asking people about your own preferences is a waste of their time.</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Sometimes "try to learn more about the people around you" really means "don't listen to anyone else's ideas about what your preferences should be\xe2\x80\x94just try to learn enough about other people so that you have some idea what your options are". If not, the most specific advice I can come up with for that is "ask your teacher."</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>...more broadly,</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>There are many places where self-centeredness can be harmful...</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If someone tells you, "you can't do that, you'll fail in your next quest to be more self-centered"</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If your self-centeredness <em>does</em> let you figure out that the thing they're suggesting <em>does</em> work in context</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you assume that if someone tells you X is a good idea, X must also be a good idea</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Try really hard to listen to other voices in the room.</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>And of course, "listen more, think more" is the sort of thing that sounds obvious as an aphorism but might be something that somebody explicitly or implicitly didn't think of to tell you, in which case it's almost certainly worth asking for more detail.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>This might not always be possible, of course...</strong> - But if you're asking someone for advice and they say "you can't listen to other people" in response, at least try to <em>understand the thing they're saying</em>. It might be the best concrete answer you can get.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>And if they say "you'll fail at life, at least at first" in response, remember:</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'm not saying that's a <em>good</em> reason to be more self centered</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I'm actually saying that's pretty strong evidence</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><br><p>While you should probably be willing to dismiss "boring advice"\xe2\x80\x94which for some people means dismissing actual useful advice that was presented in as obvious, non-consequentialist way\xe2\x80\x94I at <em>least</em> recommend <strong>taking the time to be as specific as you can</strong> when someone offers you advice.</p><br><p>And while we're here, I'll say right now:</p><br><p>If I want to be altruistic, it's probably not enough for me to say that I "want to be altruistic so I can feel better about myself". I should also go out and give someone $50 and think some good thoughts after that.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
