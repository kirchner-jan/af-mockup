<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul><br><p>Previously:  Betting Is An Engine of Growth</p><br><p>Previously, Robin Hanson wrote:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Robin would like it to be easier to build prediction markets. This may not be the central way to solve this problem\xe2\x80\x94or it may. But it _is _a possible way to get better predictions. And if it's good enough, we should do it.</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>If you are an insider and know how one of these problems could be resolved now, please do share your ideas.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>But it is also interesting to imagine a version of the current prediction markets that one could conceivably build using current technology, that would be a good market that we'd be happy to use...</p><br><p>The idea that Robin is putting forward is that there should exist a system where insider information can not predictably produce profits for those who know. This is good in ways Robin would approve of.</p><br><p>This is more concretely stated: Robin points out, that the system is currently broken in ways that make its existence valuable and its use difficult. In particular, Robin says he can't see how to resolve the central points. As an example, here's a prediction market in case this one of the examples isn't already clear:</p><br><p>There were many questions on Nate Silver's election prediction page: Who will be president? Who will be the Vice President? Who will be governor of Pennsylvania? And so on. Those who know the answers to these questions but not to the rest have an edge, and thus can make money by <em>betting.</em> The system currently being used is broken in multiple ways to prevent this from happening.</p><br><p>There is something else that needs to be said about prediction markets being a problem in the first place. While they certainly provide value, their existence and use also tends to encourage and spread confusion. You have the option of betting on politics and the rest of the world, and the media provides coverage to spread the news. It's hard not to start thinking that's where our democracy is. When it's all there is to think about, you can get bogged down in details.</p><br><p>Those who can and choose ignore the details can find something valuable in the system. Those who must go deep into the details and try to find them value can get bogged if we make sure to not talk about them. I've seen a lot of people on the Rationalist website complain about this.</p><br><p>I have some ideas for creating or improving the prediction market at the top level, along with a general sense of what can change at every other level. But I'm going to describe things in advance, so I can give a sense of what might change and how, and I can go back to the original question.</p><br><p>What I Can See</p><br><p>There is a central prediction market in the top level called The Good Judgment Project. This is designed to see how accurate people can be at forecasting events, from a neutral point of view. It gives several different tasks that people can be asked to complete, so you can see how capable they are at these tasks individually, and learn about the range of abilities. The central goal for that market is to give a good sense for how well people are doing, without making a specific prediction one way or the other.</p><br><p>There's a way to view a lot of the results of past events from a neutral point. If we look at the results of past superforecaster tournaments, we see that one player won an impressive 25% of the time, in a variety of cases.</p><br><p>That player was Nate Silver. Nate Silver famously runs FiveThirtyEight and won major prizes from other prediction markets. He also, by the results of his superforecasts, appears to have done a great job predicting the outcomes of past events. We see very few cases of the "skeptical theism" response. As far as I can tell, the Skeptical Theist is a correct guess in roughly 40-60% of cases. I would presume that this is an exaggeration but not an understatement by any means, since the people making the judgement are well aware that it's a correct guess on average.</p><br><p>One must also note that the general population is capable of guessing a great deal more often than this. Most people in the right place at the right time will guess well from time to time.</p><br><p>I'm not going to get into details here of the specific methods that have been used to forecast the events, but I can see them and I agree with the general conclusion. The skeptical theism is a good guess, on average over time. It's better than chance, but the prediction markets haven't done exceptionally well so far, so it's not impressive.</p><br><p>Of course this isn't exactly on the same level as what superforecasters have seen. These systems need to be run for a long time to have good data.</p><br><p>It's also not clear what we are looking at here. We are looking at a player who is a well-known expert in forecasting. If you look at their track record, you can find some good predictions, but so can a random person. If they get into a position where they can affect the event, how big a deal do we give that? Why would that be something important, but someone else not having a role in the scenario not important or not big?</p><br><p>If Nate Silver thinks that the other candidates have a good chance, will he still be in a position to win, if they don't win the election? If you think the answer to that question is "not really", that's a huge change of perspective. How can we account for and quantify this? If I think the answer is "not too much", that seems like an almost guaranteed loss to me. It seems like a better metric would be the probability that I myself would guess correctly\xe2\x80\x94this is what I'm looking at in my previous posts.</p><br><p>This brings up another obvious problem. A superforecaster can't use their insight to make money unless that person has a financial interest in the situation, right? Nate Silver would either have to write a book about it or be a journalist. So this looks like a great way for the system not to work at higher levels, and indeed it does. At least, such superforecasters <em>can't</em> bet, because it might affect an official result, due to having information not seen by others.</p><br><p>I've seen it the opposite way, too. The people who said Trump was going to be president before the election, when the chance was only 2% or 10%, were <em>widely</em> disparaged and made fun of. They were accused of being "the guy who bet the election".</p><br><p>Here the superforecasters seem much more widely respected. Of course I can find a bunch of "here I am a stupid guy who bet the wrong way, please feel sorry for me" on Reddit somewhere, but I don't expect to find much at the same level of respect as we find among the superforecasters.</p><br><p>As for me, if I say the odds right now that Hillary wins are 60-50, that's a dumb, wrong and terrible bet. But the market does this, so I get points for honesty, but I also have to do other things to get those points. The result is I'm now looking at the prediction markets, and they have me at 99% or higher on Hillary winning.</p><br><p>So this is another way the system appears to be in a good place. It's hard to tell what if anything is wrong so far, because the results in the end have come true quite a bit. The system definitely does not like betting against the expert superforecaster. Of course someone who says "I'd still bet against the superforecaster even if they said 1%", that's a dumbass that can't admit they were wrong. In theory, it does look like the superforecasters are doing very well, but it's very hard to figure out how to measure that. And there are many very large factors in how those markets work that I lack knowledge about.</p><br><p>I get similar feedback from the discussion on other prediction markets. We often talk about how the market is a dumb market, in order to make it seem the market can be exploited, and then make dumb bets to exploit that exploit. It's a weird sense of status.</p><br><p>We can take a broader look. There is one general level of difficulty one can see, in this system and in other prediction systems:</p><br><ul>
<li>The question you need to be in a position for a market to occur is simple enough to be resolved by a professional election forecaster, and I would guess that they are quite good at that. So if a superforecaster wants to win, they need to know the result. This seems like a massive advantage for them, and one that superforecasters get a lot of credit for.</li>
