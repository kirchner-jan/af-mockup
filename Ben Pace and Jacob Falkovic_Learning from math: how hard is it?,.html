<p>Suppose I have a black box: a closed system which does a certain set of actions, and from which I can calculate some (arbitrarily complicated) output values. I want to take the output values, and I want to figure out what is inside that black box. (I don't have great intuitions for this part at all, so I'm really just saying "what do you think are inside the black box, and what do you think is the set that would cause that output value given that set of inputs.")How can I go about this? I know that I should be able to do some kind of math on these values\xe2\x80\x94maybe some algebraic manipulation, maybe some different kind of linear algebra. Or maybe something totally different. I also have some vague idea of what sort of input data is in the box.</p>

Good luck!</p><br><p>This post is also available as a PDF here.</p><br><p>Exercise Notes</p><br><ul>
<li>This post has the flavor of an extended homework assignment. I think it's useful to work on this for a couple of reasons: 1) it's useful in the process of learning something new. There are a lot of exercises, and it's important to know what to do with them. Working on many exercises at the same time means that I will remember all the exercises I've worked on. Sometimes new concepts come up in the context of solving exercise 8, and then I'll remember what they look like when seen in the context of exercise 8. (This is how I learned to solve both problems in the first place, and I found it useful as a hint for the solution of this new problem.) 2) It's helpful because when I work on this for an hour, it builds some habits for working on a similar assignment in the future, when and where I might need them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This exercise is a particularly extreme version of the task in Learning from Math. You are working with a black box which does some actions, you have some sense of what's inside that box, and you want to know the outputs of those actions after taking the input that's in the box.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This question is slightly trickier than the previous two questions because you are limited in time, but it's a nice problem nevertheless.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>For the previous two exercises, you are probably better off using the formalism of this section, rather than the more informal one above. You'd write out the function and its partial derivatives, and consider what the partial derivatives on the right hand side look like, and use that to figure out what's inside the box. (A more informal example: the set of all inputs {xn} for a computer program is a set of n points in R, and all outputs of that program are continuous functions of the program's previous inputs. Given these inputs and outputs, how many layers away are you, and what functions are you, if you are only allowed to use the most basic operations like addition, multiplication, and comparison and not memory? You'd have to figure out what the most basic operations in the box really look like first.)</li>
</ul><br><p>If you want to continue on this, and learn how to do this sort of thing, then you can go ahead and do so now, using this first set of exercises (in the next week or two), and then come back here and read this post from now on, whenever you have anything you need help with (or when the next set of exercises comes out). I will also be reteaching this material to some people working on AI in the following six months, and so I think that it's an effective way in general to try to convey math concepts to people, and help them build up empirical intuitions about particular areas of math.</p><br><p>But if you're trying to learn math from scratch and this doesn't interest you, or if you want to practice solving problems from the beginning as if you were trying to learn calculus for the first time but know how to solve differential equations, then read on!</p><br><p>(If this post seems hard for you, or you know someone who needs to know it faster than you, it may still be worthwhile to read on:)</p><br><p>Explanation</p><br><p>One of my main goals when I'm learning something, and I mean this both as a programmer and as a teacher is to come up with good tests. I think that teaching good tests is a very good way to tell whether someone knows what they're talking about from the beginning. They also provide a really natural way to assess progress, which seems quite important for a topic as confusing as math.</p><br><p>Of course, I only get an answer if someone takes the time to go through the question, so I need to be able to test whether they got the right answer. For exercises of the form "here's a black box, figure out what's in the box", we can't do this "test": we don't get to look inside the box as they're thinking about the problem. The only things we can do to test someone's knowledge are exercises of the form:</p><br><ul>
<li>Try to solve the problem yourself first; check if you understand the problem and what's in it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Solve the problem using the framework outlined above. Try to figure out where the parts of it resemble the parts of the problem. You might need to do some algebraic manipulation to get the answer, and that may be the right way to do it. (You may need to know that you can do it this way.)</li>
</ul><br><p>What I mostly did in these exercises is try to think of how to test whether I understand the problem or not. I tried to build up my intuitions about how a function-based box looks from the outside. What the notation really represents and what the symbols mean in different cases. I wanted to come up with something like the following:</p><br><p>It seems clear that if we take a point y=f(x) and a small enough interval around x =x0 we can get a lot away from that point. It's possible that f is differentiable in that interval, but given any y not too far from x0, f(x0) is unlikely to be differentiable in the specific way that will force a single function approximation to work well in the x=x0 case. But we have an expression for y, and we can check how that change in y affects any function based on that expression. Can we use that? Can we use some other trick?</p><br><p>Here's my first attempt: what do different x in this region have in common? Well, they're all within the same small interval of the same value, so by continuity (or maybe some less obvious technique) that interval has to be sufficiently small so that the x only depend on each other through the functions. So I imagine that f(x)|x\xe2\x88\x92x0 looks like a bunch of different functions, and so f(x) is continuous enough that a "very narrow" part of f(x) will look the same at a very different point x0. So, we're done! We don't need complicated derivatives. Just go back to our black box and look at it from the outside!</p><br><p>Of course, x-dependent functions don't really match up with their output that directly. They can be differentiable when the point x changes, and we're not looking at that. But we can think of them as some sort of limit of functions that don't depend on x at all. So, in the limit, the x-dependent parts of y should look basically the same as the y itself. Which means that since f(x) looks continuous as (x,y) changes, so should f\xe2\x80\xb2(x) (we use f because x-dependent parts are only a small part of f). So we can also do a different trick to figure out what f\xe2\x80\xb2(x0) means from the outside. But, if we just have an expression for f and f\xe2\x80\xb2, that's enough. Just remember to differentiate f and f (but not f\xe2\x88\x921) and then we should be able to figure out what it means.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
