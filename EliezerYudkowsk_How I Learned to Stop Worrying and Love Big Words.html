It's a fascinating story; but for now I must just ask whether the Command Line (as I'll abbreviate it from now on) is a <em>big</em> word, or a little word.</p><br><p>I can think of at least three reasons why the Command Line might be a big word:</p><br><p>The first is that it's an <em>easy</em> concept to understand. You don't need that many ideas to understand what a "command line" is. The word "command" sounds like a command (to obey it? to execute?)\xe2\x80\x94it's an easy, simple word to understand. Maybe I even understand what people mean when they use the word "command line", because I understand the concept of a <em>commander taking their soldiers' orders</em>. It might be hard to see a general in history who takes his soldiers' orders to attack, but it's easy to see a commander who gives his soldiers some job to do, like cleaning up a messy mess, and that's the whole concept that Eliezer Y-D-K got from his "command line". </p><br><p>Eliezer Y-Y-D-K may be right in that, since most people can see a commander just by looking at the soldiers, who are the ones executing the commands. Maybe the Command Line is a big word because most people can tell the difference between commanders and commies.</p><br><p>The second is that it seems like a "big word" would be useful to have, and it appears in lots of other concepts that Eliezer uses. For example, Eliezer says a lot about "algorithms" and "programs" that other people might understand, but it's not very likely that someone who hasn't read <em>In The Beginning</em> thinks of a thing exactly like a "command-prompt", as part of the concept of a "computer".  (I do <em>not</em>, myself, consider the term "computer" to have the correct "big" meaning, here.)</p><br><p>The third reason is that "big word" is how Eliezer describes an idea, which must be defined to make sense. When Eliezer says "algorithms", he means <em>programs that systematically search through possibilities, with a command line to control them</em>. It's a <em>big</em> concept, even though most readers can probably see what a "command-processor" is, because the word "processor" comes attached to a bunch of other things. It would be hard to describe a thing that searches through possibilities while staying exactly the same concept as a computer's "processor", unless it happened to include a lot of computer-specific concepts like "buses".  The Command Line (that I will abbreviate CL) is a concept that happens to include lots of things that are associated with "computer", but in many cases, without the "processor" attached.</p><br><p>Or to put it another way:  An idea whose <em>best</em> description would be a big word, usually <em>is</em> a big word; the <em>rest</em> of the times, "big-wordness" is determined by other things the idea <em>does</em> have in common with its neighboring ideas, apart from the "big" part. To go over a few of these characteristics: The "big" part of "big word" may be associated with the concept of a command-prompt or with "processors", depending on its neighbors. The "big" word may be defined by its neighbors. For every idea that isn't at all like a computer, its "big wordness" will be determined by what it lacks in common with neighboring concepts, rather than what has in common.</p><br><p>So if you <em>don't</em> know what a "command" line is, you won't be able to <em>invent</em> the Command Line, because you won't understand how the world would be different were its absence. You might invent different things that look quite like "command" lines, but they won't actually be.</p><br><p>In this way, "big wordness", which seems like a property, really isn't; it's a property of <em>description</em>. It may exist outside the world of things that actually <em>exist</em>, but the things that exist, and are actually found.</p><br><p>The third reason given above is the one I have in mind, when I say the Command Line gives Eliezer a new perspective on algorithms. A word like "algorithm", in the <em>best</em> description for that word, must involve "search through possibilities" at some point. Otherwise, any algorithm would be nothing like an "algorithm", because it would have to have some other defining characteristics. But Eliezer's definition of "algorithm" is the same, for him, as any definition would be for anyone who didn't exist.  (The concept has not acquired a particular place in the world of things; it exists elsewhere, but it is not here.)</p><br><p>This is related to the phenomenon of the "special term of art".  It's not the <em>same _thing as the special term of art; it's not an exact copy, in the world, of the special term of an art that may or may not exist. But it has some characteristics in common with the special term of the thing that's the conceptual cluster. For example, when we talk about a "processor" inside a computer, we might talk about a piece of metal in order to get at the idea of a piece of metal _without</em> the idea of a CPU. So the concept can sometimes be used in place of a technical term like "computer" or "processor" even though the corresponding thing doesn't yet exist, if people have already been using the concept in some other context.</p><br><p>I claim that one reason why the Command Line may be a big word is because it <em>gives a person a new perspective on software and the future</em>; or, more precisely, it gives one an idea of the nature of software engineering, which is a pretty big thing in the real world. I don't know if the Command Line is very important for Algorithms on Earth; perhaps it isn't very important. But if I'm to use the word "algorithm" at all, it's important for me to _define _this thing I call "algorithm" to include the Command Line. That way, my word "algorithm", if it has a real importance, will be able to have the same impact that Eliezer's original description had in changing one person's entire world image.</p><br><p>This is an example of why I call "big-wordliness" a property of description, rather than of <em>things</em>. Because if you have a new idea that describes many things, most people can tell which ones are the new things. It might still be a large, confusing cluster of concepts, but most people can figure out the big unknown one from the small known ones:  "Eliezer Yudkowski's new concept!"  When the concept is new, it seems to have a lot in common with everything else. But once you've <em>described</em> it\xe2\x80\x94which is a property possessed by <em>description</em>, not by the thing described\xe2\x80\x94there usually won't be anything else you can call it, not even a big word. Once the Command Line gives you a new set of ideas, most of the time the idea will <em>also</em> be a big word. It may still be confusing; it may not yet be clear how all the concepts are related. But the idea will always be <em>described</em>, in terms of its neighbors.</p><br><p>So "big wordness"\xe2\x80\x94as I use the term\xe2\x80\x94is a property of description; a property of <em>the thing of this thing</em>. The more important the concept is, the bigger its "big-word-ness".  The more it matters to you, the more you should worry about whether it has an exact meaning in the world of <em>things</em>\xe2\x80\x94even if the things themselves aren't around for you to check. And then again, if it matters to you to know exactly what you're talking about, this is a <em>description</em> property, not a thing-property. A big word is often a description with a built-in model of the territory, rather than a territory unto itself.</p><br><p>And that's how Eliezer got his big-word view of algorithms, and that's why I'm calling it "big-wordiness" and not "big-wordedness".  When you're just starting out, you may even <em>have</em> a model (an intuitions) of "How an algorithm would behave, if it were put into practice on a computer", and you might even <em>knowing _this, see the Command Line as an easy-to-understand explanation for how computers _would in fact</em> behave. Then you can wonder about other characteristics of algorithms, but the Command Line seems a clear, concise explanation and you don't even need to <em>see</em> a computer\xe2\x80\x94or, indeed, even to have any model of one\xe2\x80\x94"processor" or "CPU" to know what it was, even there. But if you already know how an algorithm works, then there's the Command Line to explain it. Like the difference between a map that has never been drawn, and a map that was explained to you, but you have to search around to find your own map.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
