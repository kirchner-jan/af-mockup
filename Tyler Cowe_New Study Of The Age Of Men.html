</ul><br><p><strong>Follow Up To:</strong> New Survey Finds Most People Can't Even Name The Four Horsemen Of Aging,  A Personal Account Of Longevity Escape Velocity</p><br><p>As usual, I'm not going to summarize the entire book because that is a book that demands summary, but as you can see from the quotes, it's a very interesting account of a very important subject, and one which I'd like to have more familiarity with. If you're not aware of the subject, this is a book on the role of DNA damage with a focus on cellular senescence and aging in humans. Basically aging is an attempt to reduce your DNA damage load.</p><br><p>What's New?</p><br><p>There is a paper coming out in the journal <em>Ageing and Ageing Letters</em>, a collection of the medical literature on a specific disease of aging, namely cellular senescence. It discusses a bunch of very specific results that I won't get into here, but the takeaway is, people who are very old have a high rate of cellular senescence in their body, and that increases with age. Also, the telomere lengths in their bodies shorten with age. The telomere is a section of the DNA that's specialized to stop enzymes from degrading the rest of the DNA, so when a cell replicates it's telomere may get shortened. If this happens frequently enough it could be problematic, especially since the telomere is usually measured at the end of the DNA piece that would be replicated anyway (and we can't change it).</p><br><p>This is an important discovery, because it tells you something which a lot of people know but don't really understand because it's hard to put together the components into actual facts. For instance, I had always thought that the way that aging happened was via genetic change in the DNA, and so the more I learned that cell senescence is a feature, not just of age, but of age-related cells, the less I thought aging was a <em>real</em> problem, because a new cell would just copy the older DNA, so if the older cells get senescence and die that's no news. This book makes clear that senescence is one of the mechanisms of aging and that age-related cell death is not the end of the story.</p><br><p>I'll also note, and this is what sets off my "Oh COUNT THE WAYS THIS IS NOT THE UNIVERSAL EXPLANATION FOR ALL AGE-RELATED CIRCULATORY THOUGHTS" alarm, that the telomere study also showed that <em>young</em> people had longer telomere lengths than older people in their tissues and blood, so the difference was driven entirely by the aging tissue, not the age tissues in general.</p><br><p>What'd the study find exactly? Well, to help you understand, here are some quotes from the book, that I've translated directly from the book.</p><br><p><strong>Telomere Loss And Cellular Senescence,</strong></p><br><p><strong>Cellular senescence is the main form of human aging, but because we don't understand how it causes cell loss, we still can't predict what diseases of aging will result from cellular defects. The accumulation of senescent cells is a hallmark of aging and of age-related disease. Cellular senescence is accompanied by chronic inflammation, a hallmark of most age-related disorders, including heart disease, hypertension, cancer, inflammation of the joint lining, and Alzheimer's disease.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Telomerase is critical for cellular senescence, and we know that expression of the active form of telomerase decreases as humans age. We also discovered that the telomerase gene is methylated in normal cells, and that the methylation is increased in senescent cells. In vitro experiments suggest that methylation could inhibit the expression of the gene. The hypothesis is that demethylation could reactivate telomerase and rejuvenate senescent cells. If true, demasking the telomerase promoter might be an effective therapy to delay or prevent the progression of aging and age-related disease in humans.</strong></p><br><p>In that final sentence I want to highlight what I regard as one of the big ideas here. Most of your problems, most of your cellular senescence are the result of the cell killing itself. Why couldn't we fight the problem? We have plenty of drugs that prevent cells from killing themselves. Why is suicide such a risk if we're trying to prevent it? We understand that cancer, that there are diseases that cause cells to die as part of their normal replication. We can already treat them with drugs, so why is aging different? And since the telomeres shorten with age anyway, why can't we get some of the benefits of telomere lengthening by treating old people. If we could lengthen their telomeres, then if they ever developed senescence the damage to their telomere lengths from senescence, would be much less since the senescent cells would just kill themselves, right?</p><br><p>There's just one problem, it turns out.</p><br><p>"The methylation of the telomerase (hTelO) gene could also increase cell proliferation by repressing endogenous inhibitory proteins of the cell cycle, specifically p16INK4a and p14ARF [p16 and p19 genes are involved in the senescence/cellular crisis signal]. Loss of p16INK4A and p14ARIF is one hallmark of senescence, although the cell cycle is never actually blocked. Indeed, senescent cells increase their rate of proliferation as part of their process of conversion to apoptosis."</p><br><p>In other words, we see that one of the first symptoms of senescence is an increased rate of cell division among senescent cells. This idea would be a perfect answer to the treatment of old age. What I want to know in the context of aging more generally is where this "means a cell would gain an advantage, maybe?" is coming from. I want to know what type of advantage. It seems to suggest that if we could make senescent cells die quickly enough then in all likelihood we would have nothing to worry about.</p><br><p>On the other hand the book doesn't seem to have discovered this "means we have to find some way to make senescent cells kill themselves?" in particular, even if we want to treat old age generally or just age-related diseases. At least not in so much as to do anything with the underlying problem instead. Also interesting is that it's a rather big question of why old cells senesce, why not old cells go around dividing faster? It seems like that might be related to this idea that cells gain an advantage by staying in senescence so as to prevent mutations from their replication. But not entirely so. The telomeres aren't actually important in the decision to stay senescence either.</p><br><p>There's also the question of why old age is an all too common age of disease and death in particular. If old ages are just long-lived senescent cells, then why do we see this increased rate of death at that age, all of a sudden? Why not at 40? It seems like they're having some kind of effect in that age range, but I don't know what.</p><br><p>What <em>is</em> this effect? If senescent cells kill young cells by making them too small, then that'll slow evolution, right? Well it turns out, we know exactly how this can happen: apoptosis. I don't know if apoptosis is normally active in a cell early during replication if it doesn't want to replicate, or something. Maybe, maybe not. But if replicating at higher rate means less replication, this is exactly what I'd expect. (Another thought I'll also bring up in later articles: That old cells can gain an advantage via a similar mechanism by turning into stem cells and then regenerating themselves, so if senescent cells do that they'll get a head start on new cells. I'd certainly love to see more on that.)</p><br><p>But it's still a little bit weird, I thought? "A lot of what's wrong with old age, is that they're senescent and old!" What's the alternative? Cells that are young in an old body are going to be just as senescent as the cells of a young body, so there's no way to stop that. That doesn't sound like the kind of benefit it was talking about, right? I feel like it would be a real improvement to have an intervention that doesn't just slow down the clock, but actually improves the condition! Why did we have to wait 40 years to find the answer? I hope it wasn't because of my impatience. I'm feeling my own age in this regard.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
