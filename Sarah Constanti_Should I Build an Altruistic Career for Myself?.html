It's especially hard to build a good career without having a "career capital". Career capital is money, skills, domain knowledge, and relationships that others may pay you to leverage for their own benefit. It's not as simple as "paying enough to get a good job." If you have good career capital, you can usually make more money without a raise, or get a higher-paying job without quitting your current salary low-income job.</p><br><p>Many people lack career capital. (I don't have to tell you this, since you're reading LessWrong. ) Career capital is especially valuable for people who might be good at their job, and need a better one to start building something else. If you're in a high-risk industry (programmers, scientists, startup founders), this might apply to you whether or not your job is intrinsically risky. The same is true if someone else has leverage on you, and will make you jump through hoops to convince you to apply for another job.</p><br><p>However, even if you don't have career capital, or have less than you want, it is possible to build more career capital. The most common ways I've seen people build career capital are:</p><br><ul>
<li>Get good grades in school (or at least learn to get good grades).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Do a lot of volunteer work with non-profit organizations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Work a bunch of jobs for non-profits you've heard of. (As opposed to starting your own startup, which is a lot more risky and a bad plan.)</li>
</ul><br><p>All of these methods work, and are easy to quantify, so I should talk about them. You can even quantify them using Google scholar, though I won't do that here.</p><br><p><strong>1. Good grades in school.</strong></p><br><p>Getting a good grade in school is pretty obvious. If a grade is good, you'll get more points than if you had to work extra hard and do something difficult. If the system is good, it won't bother you much. It's also easier to make it into a "good" system than to work hard or do something difficult for a year.</p><br><p>What should you expect? A good grade, given the information available to teachers, will usually come out to about 65%. (I know because I got an "A" in 6th grade Spanish, and my Spanish teacher at the time believed about 60% I knew it because I'd read and talked about it in class.) That means of course, that it takes effort to get a good mark; you can get a bad mark from having nothing left to teach. But it's usually not difficult, and it's usually not too costly to get a good grade, even though school may seem very hard.</p><br><p>The main cost is probably getting in the habit of doing things you don't want to do, and not doing the things you actually do want to do. You want to use this time to play, explore, develop friendships, improve your life, learn other stuff, etc. Also, the value of spending time at this age is not very good by comparison; one of the most useful things you can learn in childhood is how to do it better later on. It is also one of the more useful skills you'll develop at this time if you get lots of practice doing it well.</p><br><p>I think the major positive effect of a "good" school grade comes from the social pressure that comes with getting good grades. Getting a good grade is a major status win for a lot of people; it makes your ego swell, gives you a feeling of being a responsible adult, and encourages you to do what it takes to get it. Getting a good school grade even though you only got it by cheating takes it a step further. It might be especially motivating if you see the teacher or principal looking stern at you. If you cheat, you get all these benefits while doing something you don't want or can't do anyway, and without the social cost of having the cheat caught and you being blamed for it. It definitely makes the cheat more comfortable, which is the sort of thing you want to make more of.</p><br><p>(I'm assuming here that you learn the material or at least try. It would be a negative experience if you just passively studied and never wanted to learn anything.)</p><br><p>The social benefits are the most important reason to do this; as a student, if you have a good habit of getting good grades, and are not at risk of having your grades challenged later on, then the social benefits may end up being significant. But even without social benefits, if you <em>like</em> school and feel more competent, happier, fulfilled, or successful if you are good at it, then that can be one of the best things you'll ever do in your whole life. It's not even close.</p><br><p>An added benefit of good grades is that they give you some domain knowledge (which can be useful if you do something with that domain) and some social skills. If you do this activity every week, your grades will probably improve at least to the point where you can get those benefits without cheating, and you'd get the social benefits from those grades regardless.</p><br><p><strong>2. Lots of volunteer work with a non-profit.</strong></p><br><p>Volunteer work is another common way to build career capital. If you work at your non-profit every weekend, that gives you a lot of additional domain knowledge, and is good to give you friends, and also provides credibility as someone you might make more money with if you go into business. Non-profits may also offer you a chance to practice in the skills of the organization.</p><br><p>The negative effect of volunteer work is that you get burned out. This probably depends on whether you get stuck on one particular task or project, or tend to keep switching between projects for a while. But it's not something non-profits want you to take, if they can avoid it. Working on one thing for longer than expected can be a sign you either need a break, or just haven't spent enough time volunteering in your time slot. So you won't get the social benefits of job stability that you would with a business.</p><br><p>A bigger negative is that even if you feel good at your job, working with non-profits can be a negative on your self-esteem even if you donit feel you are doing it badly. I have a friend who volunteered for a political party for four years, because she thought it would be a good social experience and gave it some credibility. It may have felt good, but it also made her feel terrible about herself, like a loser who wanted to show off.</p><br><p>A big negative negative to volunteering is the possibility of getting fired, which can make you feel like a terrible person for a time, and can set you up to feel burned out later on.</p><br><p>On top of all that, non-profits often make their positions tenuously held, and can give people bad incentives. Sometimes they pay little or no money (because they don't make enough money to merit a paycheque) and other times they expect immediate results, or don't care much about that.</p><br><p>All in all, I think that volunteering is a good career move if you can find one good enough to give you skills and contacts that will help you make more money if you do so later, but a bad one for a rationalist who knows what they are doing and wants to make more money with less risk.</p><br><p><strong>3. Lots of jobs with non-profits you have heard of.</strong></p><br><p>The reason this is a good idea is that non-profits typically accept pretty bad employees. This is what's important and you will need to figure that out to know whether you'll want to work there. But most non-profits don't give you a good test of whether you're qualified or how good you would be. A much better test is whether someone else you know has heard of them and wants you to work for them. Since you need someone who already knows about the organization, this means that if you have a friend who would have a problem hiring you if you didn't have this social capital, and if you are good, this could be a good source of job offers.</p><br><p>Another way to build career-capital is to make a lot of friends and meet people around school and church. That generally works too, although less well. The main failure mode there is you don't have much of an idea of what skills they want you for until they know what job title you want.</p><br><p>The problem with this, of course, is that any job you apply to will have people applying to too. (I am an engineer and will interview at most 10 jobs per year, whereas there are at least 100 engineers out there.)</p><br><p><strong>4. Starting your own venture.</strong></p><br><p>As a counterpoint, some people do find starting their own venture to be a good career move; they don't rely as much on the job security of their current employer, and are better positioned to try and succeed without social and financial constraints.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
