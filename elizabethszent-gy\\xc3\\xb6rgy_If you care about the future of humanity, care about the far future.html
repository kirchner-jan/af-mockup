I knew almost immediately that it wasn't the right plan, so I ended up doing minimal work on it and decided to forget about it. It's now been over a month since I first became interested in long-term thinking.</p><br><p>In the past month or so, I've been trying to convince myself to make the plan that was proposed in my "to do list". (It's been a few months since I found the "to do list" document with its plan, and a few months since the plan is to do all of it in an hour or so).</p><br><p>But I'm almost having trouble believing I'll actually do it before my next review (in January) and I'm only a month in, so it's hard to think that this is going to actually work for me. And yet I can't think of a better option (at this point) than just putting this thing off.</p><br><p>So I have a dilemma. I believe that not having acted upon my idea will cause the future of humanity to be worse off by at least an order of magnitude (probably more). And yet I won't do anything now. So why do I believe the future of humanity will be worse off by an order of magnitude? It's hard to explain this, I will try:</p><br><ul>
<li>If I do anything now (even the smallest amount of), it will probably cause my life to turn into a series of "ifs, buts and maybes". I will probably still find a way to procrastinate on my own plan\xe2\x80\x94why should I believe that it won't influence my life in some other way?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If I don't act upon my idea now, the future of humanity might very well be worse off by a greater amount than if I had just wasted two years on this. So I should put off acting upon my idea.</li>
</ul><br><p>Which side do I choose? I believe that the future of humanity (and perhaps all life) would be drastically worse off if I chose the "procrastinate on my idea" option. So I should do the opposite of that.</p><br><p>Maybe there's no good answer. I mean, I can't procrastinate on the question because I don't know how the future of humanity really is. And there's no good reason to believe that I have thought of everything that needs to be thought of. But it's also not really an opportunity to make a decision. So I go with the "do it now" strategy!</p><br><p>What do other people do about this dilemma? This would be useful to know. Or perhaps this question is a silly one! :)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
