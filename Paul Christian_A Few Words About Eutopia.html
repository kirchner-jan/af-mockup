He doesn't have time to respond to every comment, but he wants to thank Nick Beckstead for a discussion of similar ideas that influenced this one.)</p><br><p>Why Eutopia?</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"If I had to give a short definition of eutopia, I'd say that it's a world free of scarcity, inefficiency, and injustice. The only scarcity that exists is the scarcity of information that's needed to pursue your values. The only inefficiency is any physical, social, or psychological obstacle to people making use of whatever it is they most value." \xe2\x80\x95_Predictably Irrational_</p>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>"Eutopia is a vision of what life <em>could</em> be if the world were run in accordance with the values of human beings." \xe2\x80\x95_The Machine in the Ghost House_</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Eutopia is something people have talked about for a long, long time: the ideal place of humanity. It's one of the most appealing things to imagine: an egalitarian society that values equality, fairness, or the good life itself. But there are lots of versions of Eutopia that people are also just as attracted to, and none are obviously better. You could have a future where everyone has to work, but they all get paid the same for it, where there's no unemployment, and no one has to do work they don't care about. But there's also the case for a future filled with wealth and abundance for everyone; you just have to spend all your wealth to help others. You could also have a more authoritarian society where everyone follows arbitrary rules, but doesn't have to tolerate the existence of the bad ones\xe2\x80\x94and has the rule of law enforced. It can be tempting to imagine yourself in the world that appeals to you most, but it's important to remember that you're imagining what an ideal society <em>would</em> be like, not what it <em>is</em> like. </p><br><p><strong>Defining Eutopia</strong></p><br><p>Eutopian society need not look like this. For example, you could imagine societies filled with freedom, choice, or variety. Some people have even thought about the possibility of societies so filled with happiness that people would happily work a lot more just so that their lives weren't so unfulfilling. I don't know enough to make a positive or negative prediction about these ideas, but I'm sure that you can find lots of people who are interested in the idea. </p><br><p>Eutopia isn't a binary society. It can be any society that contains people who aren't stuck in zero-sum conflicts, but are instead on their way to a better future. It may even include a long-term future as part of the Eutopia.</p><br><p>Eutopian scenarios are often about inequality. I tend to imagine a world where people are wealthier by and large but not necessarily better off; it's really an open-ended question whether these societies are better off today. So if you imagine an egalitarian society with no inequality, for me that's not what Eutopia is about.</p><br><p>Most Eutopian societies probably wouldn't be utopia in the strict sense of the word. For example, suppose you were given the opportunity to do something really stupid with your life (that would be really terrible by today's standards) for some reason that you won't really be able to reverse. Do you still do it? If instead you just got to retire at the age of 20 and lived out your remaining days in a luxury palace, would this be a better life? Would it have to be? Is "eutopia" defined by the absence of inequality? If we're going to talk about eutopia, we may want to talk about society that contains people with a reasonable life, <em>but is it a better life because there aren't any inequalities?</em></p><br><p>It's hard to make decisions about what an ideal society would look like without knowing what its values are. I'm skeptical that we have values yet: we're so used to being born, and living, into the same socioecnomic circumstances that thousands of generations have lived in before us, that we don't know what we really want. This has led to all sorts of conflict between cultures and civilizations, which are great for showing humanity's folly but aren't much help in imagining Utopia.</p><br><p>But even if we could figure out what values we actually have, I claim that the world in which I have those values is not a world of equality. It's a world where there's inequality, but it's a world I'm okay with, even though I'm not a victim of it (or someone else is).</p><br><p>Given people's tendency to think of Eutopia as an inequality-free society, Eutopia can be quite confusing to people who like equality. What does equality even mean in a society designed by the values of human-created abstractions like freedom or fairness? (In the end, you can't even define a theory of generalizability through a set of values like freedom, equality, and autonomy\xe2\x80\x94because the values themselves, and which abstractions define them, are in need of justification.)</p><br><p>It may be best to think of Etopia as a future people actually want, where the differences between Eutopia and today's world are based on people's values and values don't depend on one's circumstances. Maybe this will make more sense once people have gotten some practice telling one story about the future and trying to figure out whether the stories they told themselves about the future actually happened.</p><br><p>Eetopia as the default <strong>future</strong>?</p><br><p>Suppose you believe that our values are really simple and that we value equality and autonomy in particular just about everyone, and that we've already managed to use our values to create a very good human life. So it can feel like eutopia would be just an easy step after that (though note that equality doesn't imply autonomy for everyone).</p><br><p>(And if you believe that human values and well-being are complex, I'd argue that Eutopia would not be the end of the process of human civilization, but the end of a "short" portion of the process.)</p><br><p>My main objection to this perspective is that, for all I know, the process of creating Utopia is much more complex than the simple value of egalitarianism. If our values are complex, and so are the processes by which we create good futures, then the process of creating good futures may not be much like the process of trying to reach Eutopia. It's possible that the process of creating a good future will involve hard choices, and conflict, and arbitrary tradeoffs.</p><br><p>But the main objection here is just that, for all we know, the process may be as simple as defining a value like equality, and then having our minds do the rest of the work. For all we know, if our values are anything like as complicated as I think they are, then equality isn't enough, or some other value has to come in and do the work.</p><br><p>If one doesn't believe this, then the Eutopian scenario is not very attractive because it leads to a future we hate, where everyone is stuck in zero-gain conflicts, and none of them really feels good. Or perhaps it would feel so bad that no one worked towards a future they actually were excited about. And maybe some people would even find that a world with zero-sum conflict in the pursuit of shortsighted values they aren't willing to tolerate is actually a world they like a lot, if their values don't take them anywhere else.</p><br><p>(That's what I believe; I've thought about these issues for a while, with lots of conversations with people who disagree with me, so I can't be sure that I'm wrong. I've also been wrong before; but not nearly so many times.)</p><br><p>Why focus on Eutopian scenarios?</p><br><p>In order to get a better idea of what Eutopia would be like, it's most useful to make a number of strong beliefs as assumptions, and see which one leads to the weakest beliefs. The more assumptions you are willing to make, the more information you can get about Eutopia (in general and compared to other possible futures).</p><br><p>The second key assumption is that our values will eventually turn out to be simple. Values are usually thought to be complex because they depend on the complex facts about the world, and not because they're an arbitrary human fabrication. So if you believe values are complex, it's probably because they depend on facts about the world that other people haven't discovered yet. (These facts may not actually be very simple; one important point of disagreement is that of simplicity in the theory of mind, and we'll get to that.) But if you believe values <em>can get simpler</em> as humanity makes better discoveries, then the further people are from discovering those facts, the more likely it is that we're not as advanced as we think, and that Eutopia isn't so simple.</p><br><p>So our other assumptions are:<strong>Eutopia is achievable, in a relatively short history of humans.</strong></p><br><p>__There isn't any conflict. __The people of Eutopia have a reasonable shot at cooperating, so the only conflicts are either ones created by a lack of cooperation, and ones caused by other things.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
