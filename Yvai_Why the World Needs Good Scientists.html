</ul><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p>In the course of this yearlong investigation into how academics make research progress, I learned a number of interesting things about the world of research. That's good, because I've always wanted to know. For example, how much of a salary increase in a specific profession is a result of inflation versus the increasing difficulty of the job? Do people with better skills actually get paid more? How much more?</p><br><p>I also asked myself this: Why do our institutions care about academia as opposed to any other industry?</p><br><p>This post is the first step in an attempt at answering the above questions and more. This post explores: How do research scientists earn the sort of money that lets them support a family or afford private college tuition? Do some people actually make more money than others? What is it that makes them different? Are the most well-paid researchers also the most intellectually productive?</p><br><p>To make good on <em>that</em> question, we first should make better sense of research. How do scientists actually do their work? How does it affect their lives? What research gets funded, and how often?</p><br><p>To make sense of these questions, we must first understand economics. It turns out there's no reason to think that other professions make much more money than academia. Even if you accept the existence of professional licensing as a way to stop people without credentials from competing for the same jobs, it has no effect on what the highest-paying professions are. I'm pretty confident that people in finance and consulting are more lucrative than people in research.</p><br><p>Of course, people in different professions may be more similar to each other than they seem. But I think I understand how to think about this: Each profession has a level of abstraction that's easier for outsiders to understand, and that causes outsiders to treat its employees as a homogenous group, to explain their salaries by reference to what percentage of their pay is a result of effort, and so on. "There must be a big difference between the kind of effort finance people put in, and the same effort research people put in!"</p><br><p>So we'll start asking questions about how much people earn.</p><br><p>How Good Scientists Make Good <em>Money</em></p><br><p>In <em>The Elephant in the Brain</em>, the author claims that "the most well-paid scientists are also among those who make the greatest scientific contributions." I strongly agree with this: It's not just a random accident.</p><br><p>How to Measure Anything is about some of the best-known methods of research: The replication crisis, the problem of p-values, the effect of publication bias, and so on\xe2\x80\x94that is, we understand the problems caused by these methods. To the extent that these problems occur due to problems with research funding, this is where the money goes.</p><br><p>If I understand the author correctly, she is talking about research papers, as opposed to research institutions. The argument goes: If a person can make a lot of money by writing good science papers about things that are important, then it makes sense to pay them to do that.</p><br><p>I disagree: Research institutions make a lot more money than average, and the average research paper doesn't make anyone rich.</p><br><p>First, let's have a close look at that statement about research institutions "paying people to do research": "They do that by hiring people and then by giving people a comfortable life." That's why I want to focus on individuals, and see how individual scientists perform in comparison to the market norms.</p><br><p>Second: What is "research"? The author is making a specific comparison here: "people who are paid to make theories, then test those theories, and publish their findings online." This is a common story: A scientist writes a theory describing some interesting phenomenon, tests it through experiments, and publishes the results. However, this is just a part of how researchers work. And even if we accept the common understanding that this is how research works\xe2\x80\x94though it's definitely not the only way\xe2\x80\x94it doesn't mean that the average scientist makes <em>all</em> their income from research.</p><br><p>Third: Just as any company pays <em>at least</em> their best employees, and <em>at most</em> the minimum (in this case salary), any university pays its best researchers at this minimum. The average researcher <em>usually</em> makes more money than the minimum, but they probably still make less than the market would offer.</p><br><p>Fourth: The idea that scientists make more than the market would allow is also mistaken.</p><br><p>Let's go back to the statement from the start of the post: "The most well-paid scientist <em>is also</em> among those who make a groundbreaking discovery. Some of the most successful research papers come from people making a lower salary than the average. It's all connected."</p><br><p>It's true that there are at least some science papers by people with more money who contribute more, and maybe a couple examples of this can be found. Those examples were about things like physics. But even when they are about physics, the basic problem remains: they are about physics that would be funded by physics funding agencies. Physics is not the only science that does research. Other sciences do research too, and the fact that, as far as I know, many are struggling to make their living standards more comparable to that of physicists does not mean that, in general, good science makes more money than bad science does.</p><br><p>How about computer science, where there are very few, if any, research funding agencies, and where the average researcher makes a great deal of money? Sure, many computer scientists have made important discoveries through research, but this is because they were paid to do research, in-part-by the computer companies who paid for it. That's fine! Research is great. The main problem is that researchers do a lot <em>more</em> research than average, which means that there's very little available for those who are paid just to do research, and a lot of people with more money than that don't do research at all!</p><br><p>What about research aimed at practical applications, for private companies? Again, some important research gets funded, but the funding comes in the form of venture capital or large corporations. These are entities that exist in other types of industries like tech or energy. And while I don't know of any examples of them funding research in, say, neuroscience, that in turn results in medical treatments for the same diseases.</p><br><p>This is not to say that these other industries are <em>wrong</em> for doing research on the basis that it benefits them. They are just different.</p><br><p>The author's implication is that science, which focuses on the most abstract ideas, makes the most money. I do not think that is necessarily the case.</p><br><p>If Good Science Requires a <em>Lot</em> of Money, Science <em>IS</em> for You</p><br><p>What if you live a life full of practical concerns, and just want to do science anyway? How much of your money are you losing by doing science instead of practicing medicine? How much would you have to sacrifice to do science and then actually <em>turn</em> that money into personal consumption afterwards?</p><br><p>In many cases, the answer is probably very little. Maybe you make about twice as much as a practicing doctor in your given specialty, and you are willing to do that. Maybe you aren't. The only part of earning a research doctorate that is clearly not a practical concern is time. There are some people who make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year running clinical trials, and that number is higher than the salaries of some doctors. So, if you aren't at the top of the game, and you care about doing science instead of medicine, there aren't that many sacrifices that you need to make. There may be, just like with physics above, some people who get more funding than they need, but that's it.</p><br><p><strong>There are cases, though, that science is too expensive per result, and some scientists have to choose between being a scientist and having a family, or worse: being a scientist without a position at the institution that hired you.</strong></p><br><p>If you want a lot of money and you don't want to compromise, then science is for you. Why choose medicine over science?</p><br><p>The same is true for <em>every</em> profession. We've already covered some of these. Why choose finance or consulting over research? Because these industries pay more, and because you can do better at those industries than at research. In particular, research usually requires you to do a lot of grunt work (writing papers, submitting papers, peer-review), and that you are paid a salary for, which means that you need to work more hours than you can fit in. Even if you are making money for those hours, you might need to compromise a bit.</p><br><p>Why Choose Research Over Other Jobs?</p><br><p>There's reason to think that this isn't some unique property of research, either.</p><br><p>How To Actually Change Your <em>Mind</em></p><br><p>One of the things I learned about how to think about the world is the difference between a position, and a belief. The question, "What is a position?" is like asking "What is a proposition?". We know the answers for both. A position is a particular place in our map of the world, that reflects how we relate to the situation. A proposition is the object that our map has, that we associate with the location on the map.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
