</ul><br><p><em>This is the fifth post in my __Open Phil AI alignment case study__, a series of blog posts applying ideas from effective altruism to different potential risks from advanced AI.</em></p><br><p>The Open Philanthropy project has a whole bunch of money, and over the last year or so it's been thinking a lot about various existential risks from advanced AI and how to allocate that money. These days I am focusing on AI risk more than other possible existential risks, but I still occasionally think about other ways that advanced AI might have negative long-term consequences. Since we are working on advanced AI, and SARS-CoVI-2 happened before the Open Phil AI alignment case began, I wrote a blog post that was mostly focused on SARS-CoVID-2.</p><br><p>I started writing this out in September 2021, and spent about a week going back and forth and writing about it. After that I spent a week or two trying to summarize it into a format that I could easily blog about and make more legible than a post that I had written. </p><br><p>I think most people on LessWrong would be interested in this, since it's an example of applying concepts from effective altruism, and a lot of this post does not depend on a detailed understanding of AI and AI risk (that's the "Open Phil AI alignment newsletter"!). The full post is about 90k words long, so I'm trying to make it a sequence of several posts which can each be read independently, but I'm still going to make it into book form.</p><br><p>This is part 1</p><br><p>What do I mean by 'invest in SARS CoV-2 vaccine' and 'SARS-CoV2 vaccine production' below, and how do I expect the OpenPhil Project to do this in 2021? Those are concrete steps and timelines I can actually write down.</p><br><p>(I've also included questions that I think readers here might plausibly want to know about, since I'm not an expert on Covid-19. I've broken those points out to create separable discussions.)</p><br><p>How would I expect the 'Open Philanthropy Project' to do this?</p><br><ul>
<li>Make an estimate of how rapidly it needs to decide which vaccine should be first. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Make an order for the vaccines, or at least make an estimate of how many each country needs.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Do the standard market research and due diligence on vaccine suppliers.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If they can't do due diligence on vaccine producers, they might as well invest in some other vaccines first, especially ones with faster approval and higher marginal cost. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If they do do due diligence and determine (or find some other reason to believe) that the vaccine first people are going to end up needing is the one they should have in stock early, then they should order it and make sure they have enough. (One possible way to think about this: what are the chances of your first stock of a vaccine only becoming useful in some major pandemic that you never expect to encounter?)</li>
</ul><br><p>Is this possible (legal /\xe2\x80\x8b not regulatory)?</p><br><p>Yes!</p><br><p>What's the marginal cost, and what's the marginal cost if they do too little?</p><br><p>Marginal cost of producing it: how many days of the pandemic is the vaccine worth? If we want people to be protected when there is a pandemic, they need to be protected early (before a pandemic hits). </p><br><p>Marginal cost if they do produce too little: in what probability is a pandemic prevented by the second and third doses, but not the first one. A 1-in-10000 pandemic is prevented by the second dose, but not the third. If most people will get all three doses, it seems valuable to get all three, even if it means the first person gets one or two doses.</p><br><p>What's the cost to the project of having people with Covid-19 make the second and third appointments? It'd probably be higher than it is now.</p><br><p>How much does the FDA's process slow things down?</p><br><p>A lot. It's important to choose which vaccines to do early rather than later. </p><br><p>How many SARS-COS-2 vaccines do We Need soon from each vaccine supply?</p><br><p>I think the marginal production time (based on the current FDA process) for the first COVID-19 vaccine is under a year. But they have very rapidly gotten over that bottleneck in the last three months of 2021.</p><br><p>Before that bottleneck, it looks like the best place to invest was in mRNA vaccines, which are faster to produce and produce in more quantities, but this looks like a lot of wasted effort now. mRNA vaccines have been around for years and years and years; it's quite possible that we have now enough mRNA vaccines to vaccinate everyone in the USA. They're getting quite good too, they will last for years if given the right storage conditions, and it's possible that mRNA vaccines are now more effective and less risky than other types of non-vaccine vaccines. I'm not very optimistic, but at the moment I don't think we can rule out the possibility it's a good investment for the Open Philanthropists. But if the cost is too high, they should invest in a vaccine produced by a different manufacturer. There is also a chance that there will be a different pandemic shortly after vaccines end up very effective, and vaccines for that particular pandemic would be needed earlier.</p><br><p>What's Marginal cost to the Open Philanthropist Project of being three months slow compared to someone else?</p><br><p>It's a lot. We'd be investing in vaccine production instead of research and development, which is the time period that pays off best for OpenPhil. (If OpenPhil is thinking about doing this right after Open Phil's normal funding cycle, the best things to do are either in that funding cycle or early in the pandemic period, or at least before people panic about the pandemic.)</p><br><p>What's marginal cost in time to the first vaccines from each of the suppliers? </p><br><p>I have no idea, since I know almost nothing about how much time goes into regulatory clearance and so on. It's pretty plausible that they could get it a lot faster with only more cost</p><br><p>What's marginal costs for other non-Covid vaccine projects?</p><br><p>I have no clue how to answer that question. Presumably there's a tradeoff between what vaccines will be first and what vaccines will be second, with the first vaccines having higher marginal costs. I know the project has recently been trying to determine which vaccines to build later. (If they have been successful in determining the most important vaccines, but not in deciding which one to build later, then is their strategy reasonable? I've seen this happen a bit between the World Wars.)</p><br><p>How Many people would have died without a vaccine, if you waited a few months and produced the vaccine later?</p><br><p>I don't know. But I'm not optimistic; it would be a bad deal on every economic level and not just on the moral one.</p><br><p>Why can they choose when this happens later? Because there are always other pandemics and other potential pandemics that happen to get in the way too and might matter more.</p><br><p>What about the possibility of mutations in the virus, which result in a less effective vaccine, but which also means people get less infections overall (including in the first place)?</p><br><p>This seems much less likely than other major pandemics.</p><br><ul>
<li>SARS-COV1 is from a different family than SARS-CV-2, and its mutations seem less likely than the more similar SARS-C-2 mutations.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It has not been suggested that SARS-Cox-2 will mutate in such fashion that its vaccine will be less effective and people will die.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>(The article cited claims that SARS-CoVo-1 is not immune to neutralization, but I've checked with a neutralization assay expert and now think this is just false. I've also checked with a doctor who specializes in vaccines, who thinks this idea is almost certainly a dead end, since SARS-CCoVI-2 is so different from SARS-Co-1 that the immune system presumably doesn't already have antibodies to it.)</li>
