</ul><br><p>I recently started reading a book about the topic of humility. This post is based on a chapter I read, describing the proper use of humility and trying to explain what I've understood. Also it is cross-posted to main LW.</p><br><p>This chapter was written by Paul Graham, one of the people who I think is the most humble person I know. This book is highly recommended and worth reading in my opinion.  </p><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p>Some people think that arrogance (claiming to be great) is proper\xe2\x80\x94when I was at primary school, I would try to defend this statement with some clever argument. And this habit has become ingrained in me: I assume that such arguments can show my superiority, regardless what others may think.</p><br><p>Graham sees this as a waste, and he's right.</p><br><p>Humility, on the other hand, is a virtue\xe2\x80\x94and not only is arrogance unvirtuous, it is a sign of weakness. Graham defines the virtue of humility this way:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own errors; to confess your fallibility and then do the best you can.</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>And I agree with the second half: we have to be humble and admit our fallibility in order to do our best, since the best we can is always something which is not the result of overconfidence.</p><br><p>But the question is, "why does it matter that we confess and admit our fallibilism?" Graham's answer is that it makes us stronger:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>By acknowledging our fallibility, we demonstrate that we are not self-deceived. Since we know we can't be perfect, we make ourselves vulnerable. To admit your weakness makes you stronger; to deny it makes you weaker.</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>So the only reason we should think of humility as a virtue is because it provides a benefit to the individual doing so: <em>I may fall, so I better stop</em>; <em>I can't win, so I better not play</em>.</p><br><p>What does "pessimism of modesty" means? It is a belief that we should never act in certain ways, or that we cannot attain the best results in all circumstances. And the most important reason why we should believe this is our inability <em>to see reality clearly</em>. In other words, it is our self-deception\xe2\x80\x94the belief that we can't be wrong.</p><br><p>And the real question we have to ask is, "Where is the evidence?", and the best defense of modesty is that we are too modest to be so self-defeating. As Graham has said, if a lack of modesty would make us stronger, then why are we not seeing people in all domains of life doing just that?</p><br><p>Now, let's dive into what Graham calls the "basic form of humility" which is the most common mistake of arrogance, and how to combat it.</p><br><p>How should we use humility?:</p><br><p>I don't remember how long this dialogue took, but the basic form of humility is something like: <em>You may be right, but I have more relevant knowledge than you probably think</em>. It is a form of argument that attempts to establish its superior knowledge by comparing to something it is less related to, and saying that your knowledge is more specialized and better. Or, more seriously, that we are <em>better</em> (in a technical sense) than others: that we have a greater level of understanding[1].</p><br><p>The error here is to look at the most relevant expertise, or knowledge, that we are related to our conversation partner, and compare it with those of our conversation partner's. Our argument should not be about the level of different knowledge the two of us have, but about the benefits and burdens of knowledge possessed by one of the two parties[2].</p><br><p>And this is <em>not</em> always a good idea, which I will soon explain in details.</p><br><p>How can we do this?:</p><br><p>If we don't know something <em>already</em>, we can look it up in Google, Wikipedia or similar. This part is <em>simple</em>.</p><br><p>If we have already learned a topic, and want to make an argument, we can look for evidence in textbooks and similar works.</p><br><p>For most people, knowledge is easier to gather than knowledge is to process and use. It is a question of <em>time</em> rather than <em>expertise</em>. So, the important part is to process the knowledge you already understand, and put it in the form that is usable to both of you.</p><br><p>If you have a lot of knowledge in one topic, you can easily transfer it to another one.</p><br><p>Should we always avoid "Losing face"?</p><br><p>Graham points out that our actions need not always be influenced by our beliefs about ourselves, and our intentions\xe2\x80\x94as long as we do the right thing:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>In fact, there are times when people act a certain way whether or not it is virtuous to believe themselves superior to others.</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>For example, when making a large donation for charity, and you ask a friend which one it is (because you think two charities which do different things can be better than one) and they choose the one you don't care about; the friend has no motive to lie, their actions show what they think of your beliefs, and there is no social cost to them if they say "you're wrong here" instead of "you're wrong because the other charity does something better."</p><br><p>But, of course, the social costs for doing something different <em>should</em> matter. In that particular case, I would not only "lose face", but I'll have to convince a significant part of the community that I'm wrong, which can be problematic if, let's say, my charity is very well accepted among the people in the community, and I want people to continue supporting it after the donation.</p><br><p>How to avoid these problems? I can't give a general advice, but here goes a partial solution that applies in some of the worst-case scenarios above:</p><br><blockquote>
<p><em>If you don't think you have time to process all the evidence you have, don't process anything</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p>What if I can't find the relevant evidence? Then you are right, but you shouldn't be arrogant. You should update your beliefs, and try to gather the best possible evidence. This is a mistake for the simple reason that most of us don't know of all that's relevant right now, and because gathering more evidence won't change your mind. And if you do choose to gather evidence, you are welcome to share it among people who don't already think they're superior.</p><br><p>As Graham also says, we know ourselves best, and he quotes that as a reason against arrogance. What he omits is that this is a general principle: <em>if you want to avoid arrogance, you could try to know yourself best.</em> This way, if you look for something and can't find it, you are right\xe2\x80\x94but you don't have to tell anyone that. And to do that, you don't have have to compare yourself to anyone else[3].</p><br><p>How can I develop a habitual instinct of humility?</p><br><p>If you want to become the type of person who thinks humility is a virtue, there are three possible ways:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>Think that you probably are wrong and can learn more.</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>Think that, when you learn more, you probably will become less arrogant. That is, while we know there will be exceptions (for example, people with dementia), we could say that we have some decent evidence that in general, we are right (not only in this instance) and our estimate of our own superiority increases the more we learn.</p><br><ul>
<li>"Self-knowledge of fallibility" would then be the key term which describes this second phenomenon.</li>
</ul><br><p>And some more personal advice:</p><br><p><strong>Get into the habit of <em>listening and understanding</em> other points of view.</strong> It is a very important habit, and one of best ways to become more humble.</p><br><p><strong>Be humble and open-minded</strong> towards others' knowledge and arguments, <em>as long as</em> they demonstrate that they know what they believe and know the support for it. This is why it helps to remember that someone could understand you easily, and this can be true. But that doesn't mean they have to agree with you.</p><br><p><strong>Do not allow yourself to be arrogant, <em>regardless of</em> the other person's attitude.</strong> The error is thinking that you, or the people around you, are automatically obliged to believe your opinions and arguments if enough evidence is presented. But when there is no evidence, the burden of proof is still on the person who claims superiority.</p><br><p><strong>Think that others are probably more rational than you.</strong> Graham says this is the most important fact to remember, but I think it is also the most important fact not to forget. If you are convinced your arguments show your superiority, but others might be unconvinced, then you are likely to underestimate the other party\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to the point of having a <em>wrong belief</em> about your beliefs being wrong. (Here the error is not about the truth in your belief, but about your estimate.) So, if you have to change your beliefs in that case, you should change them in the direction of the other person's\xe2\x80\x94after all, your belief was wrong.</p><br><p>Conclusion</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
