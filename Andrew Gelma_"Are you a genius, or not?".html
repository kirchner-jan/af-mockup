I'm no longer actively involved in the collaboration, so I haven't fully vetted the post; I'll probably continue to do so as the discussion continues]</em></p><br><p><em>This post grew out of discussions with Michael Li about whether there's a lot of variation in intelligence (or genius), and out of discussions with Robert Smith on the role that genetics play in intelligence. They were both helpful discussions, and I appreciate both Michael's and Robert's participation.]</em></p><br><p>As I think about the question of whether there's a very large effect of genetics on intelligence, it seems to me that the best approach is to try and decompose the question into some specific sub-questions\xe2\x80\x94how strongly do genes influence cognition and/\xe2\x80\x8bor intelligence, how do they do it, and how might this vary across populations.</p><br><p>This post lays out some background thoughts and examples, with some thoughts on the importance of genetics. Below we discuss three ways in which genetics may come up in discussions of intelligence variation, and conclude by noting that genetic variation explains a substantial fraction of the observed differences in intelligence across populations (including across species).</p><br><p><em>This was supported by a grant from the Long-Term Future Fund; however, opinions do not necessarily reflect those of the fund. Cross-posted to the EA forum.</em></p><br><p>The importance of genetics in intelligence</p><br><p>The nature of human genetic variation and its importance seems generally agreed on in the science and science-writing communities, but the extent of this genetic variation, and whether different variation between individuals, between groups, between evolutionarily distinct species etc., is debated. Intelligence is one of the most clearly defined aspects of human biology, and it's difficult not to come across as some combination of an attempt to generalize a little too much about variation into humans, or as an attempt to generalizate a little too much from other species, to the case of humans.</p><br><p>While it's true that no one would deny that there is variation in general intelligence between humans, there is little doubt about whether this variation is mostly genetic and whether this largely determines our individual differences in intelligence, both in terms of variance within any given individual and differences between individuals. For instance, most of the variance in general intelligence (as measured by standardized tests, for instance) between nations is genetic: for example, intelligence is still a reasonably good predictor of national performance even when controlling for genes, which suggests that intelligence has remained reasonably heritable over time.</p><br><p>However, in the other direction, it doesn't seem very likely that the variation seen between individuals is the result of environmental factors, such as the effects of childhood diet, education, and health on cognition. We know that there can be large effects of nutrition on cognition: for an instructive look at the data, see e.g., this review by a nutritionist in the Washington Post, which summarizes the research in this way:</p><br><p><em>Overall, the most robust findings show that the bulk of variation in intelligence that we see across individuals is the result (at least in part) of genetics. This is because we can control for age, sex, race, nutrition, education, socioeconomic status, and a host of other environmental factors known to influence cognitive performance, and thus can isolate genetics as the most influential cause of this variation in cognitive performance. And we now know that most variation in brain anatomy, brain function and behavior is the result of genetics.</em></p><br><p>In the other direction, the idea that environment could be important also seems rather strange. To the extent that it does matter, we can imagine that we could reduce the impact of environmental variation by investing in early intervention, or by reducing environmental variation among the relevant populations that would be needed to replicate these studies. To the extent the environment does matter, there are a lot of different ways that environment can matter. For children, nutrition obviously matters. So does genetics (see below). For adults, it often seems the right thing to do is to invest in education, not because these things will ultimately lead to better life outcomes (which may be true) but because they will increase the odds of having and raising children who will improve the long-term environment for those who will later take into it the fruits of intelligence, as opposed to investing in raising a child who will make their parents suffer the long-term impacts of caring for them. For older individuals in particular, our understanding of the genetics of many diseases and risk factors suggest that investing in health and treating disease before they become severe can be a very effective heuristic in decreasing overall risk of death.</p><br><p>It seems quite clear that the environment can have a large effect on who we are as individuals. Genetic effects are certainly a major component in how many things we care about the world around us, and how we live our lives. For instance, it seems to be the case that genetic variation is a major component of variation in height (the average body height by country is above here), even if the same environmental factors are operating in multiple populations. So, if we think that genetics largely accounts for the variation in intelligence between individuals, it makes sense to focus on the genetic differences underlying intelligence.</p><br><p>(It's worth emphasizing that variation in intelligence is often considered a sign of genetic disorder. While such variation definitely is genetic in origin, intelligence is not typically a major cause of serious illnesses or death in and of itself, so those who care about such causes often see intelligence as a source of genetic variation in outcomes. Also, the genetic and environmental components of variation in intelligence matter in different ways for different people. For instance, being smart in general matters much less for the outcomes that matter the most to each individual. So, given these differences, it's not surprising that many people don't want to identify as "gifted" or do anything more than what's "normal" and "natural" in order to get through life.)</p><br><p>Genetics, IQ, and human performance</p><br><p>Since intelligence arguably matters most for an individual's life outcomes, if intelligence is, to the large extent, determined by genetics then we should expect genetics to be highly correlated with life outcomes. This seems clear enough in the case of intelligence: for instance, if you were going to draw a correlation between national wealth and its average annual intelligence per person, it would be more correlated with national wealth than it would be with IQ as measured by the international standardized math test on which intelligence is often measured, which in turn is higher correlated with IQ than with IQ as estimated by some IQ tests. The same pattern can usually be seen, with a few exceptions (including some animals), in other aspects of human biology as well. For instance, height is generally much more highly correlated with outcomes in adults than in children.</p><br><p>What of the relation between genes and human outcomes in general? It seems the picture here is more complicated. As with many issues in the genetics of life outcomes, intelligence seems to be particularly well-suited to a geneticist's study. The best overviews, in my view, can often be found in a series of papers and papers on intelligence that began in the 1980s with the publication of a paper by Lynn et al, reviewing more than a decade of research by multiple teams, in which they found that heritability ranged from about 30% to 80%, with the most typical value being about 55%, suggesting that genetics explained about half of the variation in performance in an average population of children and adults. (This is in fact one of the first studies that found such estimates of heritability; others would soon find them with about the same level of reliability. In the intervening years, these estimates have improved considerably, due in part to the large, modern (or sometimes "mega") sample sizes of populations.)</p><br><p>In other aspects of human genetics, the picture has been much more complex than one might initially think. For example, one of the first reports of a "polygenic index," a set of scores measuring the number of alleles with an effect on your individual intelligence, found that intelligence might be more strongly influenced by genes than previously thought. Another report of this type came soon after, and found that these results from genetics of individual variation are strongly influenced by the sample set. Later, it was reported that these were "statistically significant" and "replicated" results. The term "statistically significant," or "significant" for short, is important when assessing a statistical result because it's usually the case that if the result was truly significant it would have appeared in any reasonable sample, so it's easy to come across as a weak result simply by chance. Replication attempts to solve this\xe2\x80\x94for instance, taking samples from the same population and repeating the study will often result in different but statistically significant results. That's why many scientists say you can't "replicate" a result until someone else has obtained the same result. Replication can take a number of different forms. Some of the most advanced forms, such as GWAS (genome-wide association study) or exome scan studies, attempt to find the exact genes that are causing genetic effects in the population, and use this knowledge to assess the possibility of causal effects on specific traits.</p><br><p>As you might remember, most of the studies reporting an association between intelligence and genes have been small in dimension, typically hundreds of individuals. This is good news for geneticists who hope to study rarer and less-obvious causes of variance, but not a very impressive finding in and of itself.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
