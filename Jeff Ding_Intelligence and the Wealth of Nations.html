<li>Summary</li>
</ul><br><p>Wei Dai recently posted a discussion about an "intelligence explosion" in which a high-level machine intelligence created improved technological and organizational tools which led to a recursively self-improving machine intelligence.</p><br><p>While I don't know enough about this scenario to really speak on it, I think its potential importance is enough to warrant a bit of inquiry. </p><br><p>I'm not planning to post anything more on this matter, but since I've said most of what I wanted to say here anyway, with a bit of a different emphasis, here's my take on the topic.</p><br><p>A Short and Simple Introduction </p><br><p>Intelligence has improved steadily throughout the last few centuries. For example, per the Wikipedia page on the Flynn Effect:</p><br><ul>
<li>The average person of today can read more quickly and remember more vocabulary and other words than an average person of 50 years ago; the standard deviation has been getting narrower as well.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The average IQ score for American military personnel increased by 6 points over the period from 1940 to 2002. </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Since 1940, the average US adult reading grade has gone from C-C-C to C-D-C, reflecting an increase in how much effort and how much testing has gone into improving grades for students.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In 1960, the average American could read fewer than half of grade-level reading passages; in 2000 that was down to around 30%.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The median time for high school students to get a diploma improved from 9.0 years to 9.6 just from 1992-2012; from 2002-2012 the median was 8.6, also reflecting an improvement in the number of passes per student and how often students can afford to attend.</li>
</ul><br><p>More recent progress can be seen here: Cognitive Improvement in a Well-Functioning Normal Person and the Cognitive Benefits of Computer Use, and the discussion which follows them. As you might expect, it generally takes a few years or decades for people to see improvements on IQ tests after getting training, but there is definite improvement.</p><br><p>The data</p><br><p>Here's a table of IQ scores from the 1950s and from today:</p><br><p>(source)</p><br><p>Note the big difference. This is partially because these tests were created and have changed substantially since the 1950s, including being discontinued after the mid-1970s, but even if we take the trend from 1950 to 1980 or so, the discrepancy is substantial. The IQ of American adults has increased by something on the order of 8 points between 1950 and 2018; the IQ of high functioning normal adults increased by something on order of 4 points in that period.</p><br><p>I think there's some reason to believe these numbers are significantly lower than the real increase due to better tests, but let's just accept the claim that the average person today can read faster and remember more words than a person who was in middle school in 1950, and suppose the average IQ of a high functioning normal adult was around 125 (around average adult human).</p><br><p>If the difference between adults in 1950 and today is in the direction of lower scores, then we should be able to see this by comparing the mean scores to the percentile scores from the chart above. By chance, there's at least some chance that this is just a fluctuation in the data\xe2\x80\x94a noise in the measurement, especially if we consider how many people haven't had a chance to read and retake an IQ test in a while, people who had brain fog while they were taking the test, people who are doing other things in that time that improve IQ, and on and on. However, even if these are minor contributions most of which cancel out, the difference between the 80th and 95th percentiles here are quite large\xe2\x80\x94in the case that the difference is entirely because the measurement is noisy, we should see a difference between the 80 and 95 the percentiles of 10-15 points. The difference between the 50th and 60th percentiles? Between 5 and 7.</p><br><p>I haven't been able to find good statistics to calculate this, but I'm going to round this up to 20% for the difference between the 20th and 40th percentiles, which is around the 80th to 95th percentile levels.</p><br><p>IQ and Labor and Capital</p><br><p>Another way to get estimates of IQ and its importance in the production of wealth is to look at the impact of increases in IQ on production. Wei Dai pointed out a few studies on this subject which suggest things like:</p><br><ul>
<li>When you increase IQ by 1 point in an adult, you increase economic output by 0.15% (after controlling for labor supply and capital supply).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Increasing the labor supply by 5% raises economic productivity by 0.18%.</li>
</ul><br><p>The connection between economic productivity and intelligence is pretty obvious\xe2\x80\x94it takes a higher quality of labor to produce a lower cost product. And it seems pretty plausible that increasing intelligence makes the supply of labor more elastic (i.e. people are generally more willing to work at a higher wage). You can imagine the reverse happening as well\xe2\x80\x94more intelligent people might not be good at jobs, so you have to train them to get them up to speed. (Wei Dai doesn't mention this possibility, but he mentions more general things such as the increase in the standard deviation of IQ scores is an increase in intelligence which increases economic production, but does so more unevenly than other causes.) I want to focus on this one aspect of the increase in intelligence but I won't be able to do that.</p><br><p>Intelligence, Labor and Capital </p><br><p>However, there's another aspect of intelligence which can give us insight into the relationship between intelligence and wealth: <strong>the intelligence level that we see at the point of maximum labor productivity.</strong></p><br><p>This is not intelligence-at-work; at point of maximum output, labor productivity is related to _how smart _the person is, not how _well _they're working.</p><br><p>If it's true that increasing the labor supply by an additional 5% of the labor force increases the return to economic productivity, then increasing IQ by 5 points is also increasing economic productivity by 0%5%*0.18%=$0.032% (if the increase in productivity is primarily due to elasticity of supply).</p><br><p>Let's be conservative and bump this down to 0.2% to deal with the possibility that I've missed something, and to get a lower bound on the return to intelligence in the form of economic production.</p><br><p>Now we have both how important increases in intelligence are, and how far they are away from an intelligence level that maximizes labor productivity.</p><br><p>The next question is where on this graph are we near maximum population productivity?</p><br><p>In the context of maximum economic production, what about our population? </p><br><p>I have a vague guess: we're between 40% and 60% of the population producing wealth in the US, which gives us a guess of between the 50th to 65th percentiles of IQ, from the 20th to 40th.</p><br><p>This is within the range of what I would consider to be the range of high-functioning normal adult human beings, so we're just looking at a bunch of normal adults here. This is pretty close to the IQ levels at which intelligence was maximized in adults in the 1950s, so let's consider those.</p><br><p>Intelligence and Labor in the US in the 1950s</p><br><p><em>C. J.
