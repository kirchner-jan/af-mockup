</ul><br><ul>
<li>What exactly is a technical explanation?</li>
</ul><br><p>What is technical explanation?A technical explanation is a way of  formally expressing an explanation as a step-by-step set of  steps. A  <em>technical  explanation</em> is one that can be formalized in such a  way. It captures what an 'explanation really is.' What good is a formalized explanation?<strong>How this can help  you explain things to other people.</strong> <strong>I think that something that is explainable can, from the outside, be understood and built on.    I think the more technical your explanation is, the more likely others  will be to follow it and build on it.</strong></p><br><p>I  think that something something technical explanation or formalization or  modeling is probably  something a lot  better than other kinds of explanations, and can probably  be better than explanation in the absence of some formalization.  'We' have done a lot of technical  explanations that we still use on a day-to-day level. I want to help people  understand the things we have done to explain.This seems interesting on the surface, but can  we do something like explain things to other things which are human?In other words __I want to understand things like how  humans  'explain things.' This would cover a lot of different  subjects, so I am going to talk about them in the order I am interested in.    First, though, we'll talk about 'explanations' and 'formalizations,  and then go on to explaining things in other fields, including human  cognition. The point of my first post will have already made itself clear: A technical explanation is one which captures the essence of the thing it expresses.A  <em>technical explanation</em>  is one that can formally express an explanation as a set of  steps, preferably in a computer. A  <em>formal  explanation</em> is a technical explanation that can be, if  needed, translated into a computer code with some effort made by a  programmer.   A  <em>theory</em>  is a formal explanation that is (optionally) expressed in a language such as set of axioms.    A formal theory might be:</p><br><p><em>1) The theory that an apple is a 'fruit'</em>.    _</p><br><p>or </p><br><p><em>2) The theory of integers, i.e. set of axiomatic statements in which any '__x__ is a member of some set of objects if and only if some axioms that say so, and axioms which say that anything in a set which isn't any of an axioms of integers, must be "false" or something."</em>      <em>In either case, a formal explanation of an apple would be something which produces some set of axiom statements. Or to be slightly less rigorous: a model/\xe2\x80\x8bmodel formalization/\xe2\x80\x8bcomputer program  of some apple, which expresses the same information as some apple,  or at least _something</em> of that sort. (We know a lot of mathematical structures and theories, like 'the theory of rationals', but these are mostly a bit more advanced than what we are interested in here with apples, and also a lot more formal.)In technical fields,  there are a lot of interesting ideas and models and theories in our  field. I am not going to list them out here (I already mentioned what I wanted to talk about above), simply because that would make this post too long (and people wouldn't have much time to engage).    However, they can express themselves as equations, or other computer programs that are of the form <em>...</em></p><br><p>_1\xe2\x80\xb2) The theory of __numbers.   _</p><br><p>_It is true that some number <strong>x</strong> is a <strong>real number</strong> if and only if it is the value of some <strong>real number </strong>. (where <strong>"__x</strong> is not the value of <strong>x </strong>"\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2 isn't an axiom of the theory of numbers, if it is in the axioms of some other field like physics, or in the axiomatic field of integers. The expression '<strong>x not equal the value of __y</strong>' is, at best, what it means for '<strong>x</strong>' to not be the'real value' or 'formal value' of '<strong>y</strong>'. To which another number can be assigned another axiom, or axiom statement, of the theory of <strong>nums</strong>.) _</p><br><p>... and there can be a lot of these axiom statements (there are  2  non-trivial integers (1 and 2), which are also non-terminating, but  we could do that anyway), or other programs that represent some notion in the theory.    One popular formalization/\xe2\x80\x8bmodel of a lot of numbers is'real numbers.'    In the next more advanced field, physics, you might have the'real numbers\xe2\x80\xb2 axiom </p><br><p>_ 2\xe2\x80\xb2) The theory that <strong>numbers</strong> are a useful model in certain areas, like physics and  the area sometimes called applied math, and their axiomatic structure is the basis of the  notion of '<strong>real number.   _  And you get a similar notion of real numbers in every field of math that  uses the axiomatic structure of '__numbers.</strong>' For instance, <strong>real Riemannian geometry</strong> (we think of the real numbers as special cases of the Riemannian real numbers when the metric g on '__Riemannian __manifold X' is defined to be the special case of an '__R __atan __like __metric' on the __real __numbers.)</p><br><p>... you get a model of Riemannian manifolds  and a theory of Riemann integrals of real functions (which is one reason to be interested in geometric integrals) - as well as the much more advanced versions of those, like '<strong>Feigenbaum integrals</strong>. You will want to go for, you know, things that are '<em>real</em>' or 'integral'.    Formalities might be represented in computer programs and models.    They can also be expressed as formal equations.   An equation is a formal statement of something (in mathematics, it is a computer program, but an equation is in another language, and computers only deal with mathematical statements in 'Math', which is what mathematicians call the code of these theories, not 'Math'), and '<strong>true</strong>' is a statement of some particular model in the theory-or maybe several models.   And in some cases (like '<strong>numbers are a useful model that is at least kinda true</strong>')  the model isn't a useful model in another field.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
