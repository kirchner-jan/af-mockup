The issue is whether we can reason about people who have different short-term preferences than us, and about what these preferences imply about them, or about how to treat these preferences. For some of these questions, it seems like the answer is straightforward \xe2\x80\x93 for example, if you have different short-temporal desires than I do, and I want to support you as far as I can, or at least do what I can to not force you into a suboptimal decision, then you're basically a prisoner's dilemma problem if there's no further information about what is optimal for you, other than what you'd prefer yourself.</p><br><p>Of course, there are further questions beyond your desires. The issue isn't that you've chosen a short-term preference and we're disagreeing on the right way to act. Rather, the issue is <em>how to treat different short term preferences</em>. This has consequences in cases of conflicts between agents with different short term preferences; for instance, cases like when someone who wants to donate 10% to charity X but not donate to charity Y is acting against his own short term interests.</p><br><p>Perhaps more relevant in the AI context, what should we make of the fact that if you build an agent, its short-term preferences will be the same as yours, but if you build an aligned superintelligence, its short-temporal preference will probably be different from yours, and thus might be more important to you than you'd think? It seems to me that the short-term preferences of an AI agent <em>and</em> the short-temporal and/\xe2\x80\x8bor long-term preferences of its owner may be somewhat different. My model of MIRI/\xe2\x80\x8bCFAR's views implies that the long-term preferences are somewhat more likely to have any effect on the world, at the cost of having a more contingent value.</p><br><p>I'd like to know what the most important EAs think about this problem, and how different their answers are. I'll note in advance that there are many considerations that I expect it would be hard to get a clear sense of from an audience of EAs, but whose value is in having one person write about them. What considerations would be most valuable to think about?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
