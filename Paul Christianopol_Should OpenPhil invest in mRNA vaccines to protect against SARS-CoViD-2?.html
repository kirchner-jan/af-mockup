</ul><br><p>A big question on LessWrong is whether it makes sense to be spending money on new developments, such as research, or on keeping things like open source software developed. I've made a spreadsheet I use for my own investments to help clarify my thoughts: https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bdocs.google.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bspreadsheets/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bd/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b1hXEZxRjJ6tF9RdX9Gv9iJT8y3rAo-3i5QWgW6Z3m-2F7uWtT1EoYg1-o-8BfW6nR3jD1zw/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bedit?usp=sharing </p><br><p>The sheet is made to easily be converted into an R Markdown file that you can import in order to play with the data yourself. As with all spreadsheet software, it's best used in read-only mode. In order to update the sheet, you have to copy the sheet and use your own formatting, which means manually cleaning up all of the formatting for the column and row.</p><br><p>I was talking to Will Newsome about this with Paul Christiano, also working on a vaccine spreadsheet, and Will noted that Paul's spreadsheet is probably better. I decided to take another look at it for myself. I can say that I'm still convinced (in spite of the potential side effects of immunization) that it makes sense for OpenPhil to invest in mRNA vaccines, especially if it takes them over the coming decade from "expensive if you want a very good vaccine" to "free, no matter how good the vaccine" and thus significantly impact the world in terms of deaths prevented. </p><br><p>The vaccines: Vaccines Still Works</p><br><p>From the table:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.openphilanthropy.org/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bproject/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bsars-cov-2-vaccines </p>
</blockquote><br><p>As you can see, Open Philanthropy seems to not be doing this right now. When I click on "Apply", I get this:</p><br><p>Vaccine projects are considered at the local level (e.g. at the FDA, universities, governments, and public health agencies), with the final decisions made at the top-level vaccine organizations. As a result, it's been a little bit hard to get a sense of the vaccine landscape as a whole, even though it is clearly quite important. Some vaccines (for example, mRNA vaccines) are approved at one step and so we would expect an Open Philanthropy role, whereas others (for example, J&amp;J's vaccine) appear to be only at a clinical trial stage. </p><br><p>But as you can see, this makes it more complex and time consuming. Thus, I would not personally be confident in recommending Open Phil to fund this project, unless we knew the role it would take and how well it would serve our mission of saving lives as effectively as possible. If Open Phil is in fact doing this, you can see at this link that Open Philanthropy is currently not yet doing so. It would make sense either way, but we certainly wouldn't want OpenPhil to be _de facto _the only ones doing this given the resources they have to spend at this point.</p><br><p>Advantages</p><br><ul>

</ul><br><ul>
<li>Cost per dose</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Cost per lives saved</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p><br><p>I think all factors other than cost are very strongly in favor of spending money on this vaccine.</p><br><ol>
<li>The vaccine is free money</li>
</ol><br><p>The vaccine is _free money. _This money could be spent on vaccines even if the current vaccine isn't an optimal use (in practice since Open Phil can't be in charge of literally all medical research) or would still get an increase later.</p><br><ol>
<li>There is room for more doses</li>
</ol><br><p>The vaccine still has many more doses available if people take them. I got my 1st shot in two days. And even if there is a bottleneck in production, since OpenPhil is the main source of free vaccines around, there is no reason to think production is bottlenecked by them.</p><br><p><strong>Safety &amp; Side effects</strong></p><br><p>If I had to personally take the vaccine, I plan on following the CDC's recommendation and waiting for my second shot (at least) </p><br><blockquote>
<p>https://\xe2\x80\x8bwww-ncbi-nlm.nih.gov/\xe2\x80\x8bpmc/\xe2\x80\x8barticles/\xe2\x80\x8bPMC5987606/\xe2\x80\x8b </p>
</blockquote><br><p>and not experiencing the possible side effects at the lowest dose listed (see the table above). I could take the shot without a pause if necessary, but I could also be at risk of the possible side effects of Covid-19, which are listed:</p><br><p>https://\xe2\x80\x8bwww.ncbi.nlm.nih/\xe2\x80\x8bpmc/\xe2\x80\x8bstudies/\xe2\x80\x8bPMC2986183/\xe2\x80\x8b </p><br><p>The benefits of this shot seem sufficiently great to justify the risk, since I expect that with my second shot, not only have I received the vaccine I needed, I likely have received it first than what most individuals would experience with other sources of vaccine as well. </p><br><p><strong>Dose optimization</strong></p><br><p>Again, I'm following CDC protocol. The most effective use of the vaccine is to administer the dose of vaccine that is needed to protect against Covid-19. This should in general allow doses to be optimally spaced for those seeking protection for a longer period of time.</p><br><p><strong>Cost estimation</strong></p><br><p>The cost to give out this vaccine in one shot is under $15. I estimate that if this would be the only vaccine source that people could rely on (and with a large amount of time to wait for the vaccine) that an additional 2-3 shots per year would be a reasonable cost for the vaccinated population.  </p><br><p>Thus, adding another 20 million people vaccinated each year from Open Phil would cost $35-50 billions, for under a 30%-75% increase in cumulative deaths from Covid-19 per year from Open Phil. This is under 5% of the cost to not-vaccinate a population of 200 million.</p><br><p>From a health care perspective, the question is whether or not this is worth the tradeoff of Covid-induced deaths in order to protect against Coviruses (other than the flu).  As I'm currently reading, the answer is it probably is. See these studies:</p><br><p>https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.sciencedirect.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bscience/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8barticle/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bpii/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bS088318X21002415?via%3Dihub </p><br><p>Here is how the study was set up:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>An exploratory study compared the costs and benefits of reducing the dose per course of whole-body influenza mRNA vector vaccination against COVID and influenza. A second exploratory study examined the cost-benefit of reducing the dose of mRNA-COVID vector vaccination to 0.5 and 0.1 mL, compared with 1.0 and 0.5 mL, respectively. </p>
</blockquote><br><p>The results of these studies are in line with the cost-benefit principle, which suggests that the costs of vaccination for both diseases are comparable given differences in the benefits. From this principle, a reduction in the dose of mRNA vaccine to 0.5 mL is likely to maximize the cost-benefit for COVID, with the cost-saving for influenza largely corresponding to reduction in the dose per course. Both the studies show that mRNA-COVID vaccination is cost-effective compared with the existing WHO standard of 1.0 mL for the annual COVID vaccination.  </p><br><p>The overall health cost per year resulting from vaccination with influenza DNA was estimated at approximately $17 and decreased to $6 after dose titration. From these estimates, COVID vaccination was deemed the dominant intervention (i.e., it was cost-effective relative to the existing WHO recommendation of annual influenza vaccination of $0.5 mL and $1.0 for high-risk individuals) across a wide range of values for COVID vaccine price.  </p><br><p>From this conclusion, we recommend a reduction in the annual mRNA-COVID dose size from 1.0 mL to 0.5-0.1 mL (equivalent to a 10-30% decrease in price). In contrast, influenza vaccines are more cost-effective than COVID vaccines and the WHO standard $1.0 mL dose is therefore preferred for individuals at high risk of infection from influenza. </p><br><p>From the study on costs of illness for COVID (note its very relevant conclusion at the bottom), we see that the risk of death for young healthy people is around 0.04% (compared with up to ~1% for influenza) so a 10% reduction in risk of death is around 0.02% reduction in COVID death rate, which is not sufficiently relevant to justify the costs of vaccination.     </p><br><p>I think it's worth thinking about what the COVID risk distribution might be like in a world where no one gets vaccinated but COVID gets contained. This is very hard to calculate. But it's clear that, for young healthy people, the risk here is much below any non-vaccination risks that could be prevented by this kind of vaccine. Again, a few billion dollars saved per year is much less than the cost of a few years of aging.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
