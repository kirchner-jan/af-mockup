This is not a trivial suggestion. Working memory is a central part of human and animal intellect. In the 1980s there was general interest in the working memory concept, but it hasn't been adequately measured. Many early researchers had no interest in measuring things and had nothing better to measure.</p><br><p>However, some interesting research was done in the 1990s by Stanislas Dehaene, who discovered that you can <em>control</em> your working memory by changing the <em>kind of things you're trying to remember</em>. If you're trying to recall an abstract object with no associated sensory stimulus, your working memory holds a few objects. If you're trying something visual and associative, it holds a single item. By consciously applying this heuristic to how many items you'll keep in mind you can radically improve your memory storage capacities.</p><br><p>A recent paper by Dehaene explores whether this process generalizes. To test this theory, he had subjects remember pairs of names and faces, but then had subjects guess whether faces were related to the names or vice versa using a picture/\xe2\x80\x8bstory test. Half the subjects were asked to name the face when they were looking at the face and vice versa. The other half were told to name the face whenever they could guess the name from the face. The second group did better at the image/\xe2\x80\x8bstory test, but not much better. Dehaene concluded that the second group used a strategy involving working memory of visual information.</p><br><p>It's an interesting observation that our brains store different kinds of information in our working memory in different ways. The more you consciously work with your working memory, the better you can improve it. Therefore, when you work with your working memories and consciously change what kind of working memory you're using, you can dramatically improve your short-term working memory of visual and associative information. This process can improve your performance on certain kinds of cognitive tests while you're not trying, although not as much. Dehaene calls this "the Leech Book of Working Memory".</p><br><p><strong>How to Babble and Primate!</strong></p><br><p>It's tempting to describe Primate thinking and Babble thinking in terms of the three kinds of information, but Dehaene and his collaborators have demonstrated that there's actually a lot of cross-domain transfer. The following is a short list of some cognitive tasks where it's useful to think in terms of Primate-style babble or Primate-style prune.</p><br><ol>
<li>Memorizing random letters. Babble on a blank piece of paper. Prune of memory storage by linking them to something in context. This allows the storage of hundreds or thousands of letters with minimal memory load.</li>

<li>Visual information</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Associative information with some associated sensory stimuli</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Working memory (aka memory palace, mnemonic, symbol memory, short-term memory, working memory, etc.)</li>
</ul><br><p>A lot of visual and associational information will be in working memory. A lot of other information isn't in working memory, but will become so if you're allowed time to think about it.</p><br><p><strong>Visual Babble</strong>: Your working memory holds a short clip of the kind of thing you're visualizing.</p><br><p><strong>Associative Babble:</strong> Your working memory holds the abstract idea plus a link to a sensory stimulus or a sound, the meaning of which is in your short-term memory.</p><br><p><strong>Working Memory Babble:</strong> Working memory holds a short string of letters and the link to another string of letters.</p><br><p><strong>Prune</strong>: This is done in a special way by linking them to items in your working memory. This allows the information to be stored without requiring you to wait until something happens in your working memory to bring it to your attention.</p><br><p><strong>Part Two\xe2\x80\x94Babble Babble and Prone Babble</strong></p><br><p><strong>Visual babble</strong> and working memory are often called Babble and Prane, and the same is true for associative babble and working memory. Note that Babble and Prine are all ways of moving around in your mind, and so are Prune and Prune.</p><br><p><strong>This is also part of the Babble and Prick:</strong></p><br><p><strong>Part Three\xe2\x80\x94Babble Prune Babble Prune</strong></p><br><p><strong>A Case Study____Babble BabBle, Babble, Prune____Prune BabBLE BabBLE Prune</strong></p><br>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
