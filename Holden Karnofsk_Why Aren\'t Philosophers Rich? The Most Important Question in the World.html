This post was originally written in 2012.</em></p><br><p>In his book "The Secret of Our Success", Steven Pinker argues (among other things) that the rise of life in the evolutionary world led to three important trends: increased tool use, cultural intelligence, and an explosion in the ability to think. In a sense, these trends are related: the capacity to culture allows you to build more efficient tools, which then enable more sophisticated cultural tools, which then enables <em>advance</em> cultural tools. On the other hand, more tool use and more sophisticated culture (as measured by brain-size in our primate cousins) are both thought to have preceded larger-brained humans\xe2\x80\x94suggesting a fairly direct route from the evolutionary world to the modern world.</p><br><p>I was surprised to find little systematic inquiry into the question of where life on Earth fits into this trend. This is particularly surprising since it's a basic question of anthropology: it's one that's usually answered by studying the distribution of animal species <em>and</em> their environments. I find the lack of answers surprising. After all, this is a question that was asked for thousands of years before Darwin's time by philosophers, such as Plato and Aristotle. </p><br><p>I've tried for a couple years now to fill in the blanks. The best I've come up with so far is a handful of plausible-seeming hypotheses, which have turned out to be difficult to test. I suspect I'm missing important things\xe2\x80\x94I suspect there are lots of strong views out there, and I haven't found them yet. (Not to imply that anyone's been ignoring them, just that I wasn't able to find them myself.) I'd appreciate any input on both the question I'm trying to answer and any other interesting questions that come to mind, both about human evolution and about the future of the world.</p><br><p>The three major axes I've considered so far:</p><br><ul>
<li>Brain size. For animals, the answer seems fairly simple: evolution selected for higher brain sizes not just because higher brain sizes gave you better thinking abilities, but also because they made you bigger targets for your prey. In humans, the answer is less clear\xe2\x80\x94did evolution select for (or, as has sometimes been argued [1], <em>cause</em>) higher brain sizes? I've found no convincing arguments either way. Brain size data are too scant to confirm my hunch, though I'll note that brains tend to grow in size in the later period of postreproductive age in humans. But the point remains that "intelligence" is basically about cognition (among other things), and <em>what</em> cognition is primarily selected for by evolution is hard to say. We have very little understanding of cognitive scaling laws, in fact. As a result, I find it highly plausible that our <em>current</em> higher cognitive abilities (such as our ability to do research) resulted from evolution "pressuring" our ancestors to become better researchers, rather than from direct selection for increased intelligence per se. See also the recent discussion here on LessWrong: How much IQ is genetic, and what can we do about it?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The emergence of the evolutionary world in particular. Steven Pinker makes the strong case that the evolution of hominins (cognitively enlarged humans like us) was driven by the evolution of the <em>other</em> primates (those which share with us a large number of similar features), which were by far the fastest-evolving species. Some (particularly the ones I talked with in 2012) have proposed that a key difference between the primates and us humans is that (a) the hominins didn't develop into "super-hominins" (as distinct from "hominins") but rather (b) we did, by acquiring an extremely important new cognitive ability. In this discussion I assume they are wrong, but I can't really prove it. It's unclear to me whether hominins were as capable, relative to other primates, of performing feats like walking, speech, or tools; it's unclear whether intelligence helped or hindered us in acquiring these traits; and it's unclear why hominins "failed" at most tasks in which other primates became competent. If other primates and hominins <em>did</em> differ in their intelligence and general mental ability by a comparable amount, and if our intelligence enabled us to acquire useful skills more easily and at a similar level to our nonhuman primate cousins, there would seem to be reason to treat "intelligence" as an important driver of human evolution. Still, it would be nice to have an independent line of evidence on the matter of whether chimpanzees and hominins were equally intelligent in 2012, as well as evidence about whether intelligence "drove" or "slowed" human evolution in other places.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>"Tool-users" vs "foragers". The other major axis I can find good evidence for is the question of what the evolutionary history of hominins was like, and whether or not they went "from foragers to tool-users". On balance, the evidence is suggestive neither way. On the one hand, if foragers became tool-users, that means that foragers already had a lot of mental ability: they just weren't very good at using it yet. This is evidence that having a high level of mental ability isn't required for the ability to become a forager (or at least it wasn't in the Pleistocene). However, "foraging-to-the-edge" is an ancient strategy that we can find in other animals\xe2\x80\x94e.g., among chimps it seems common and effective. So the issue seems unclear to me. In any case, the human story starts with foragers who are already "foraging-intelligent", so why should selection drive them towards foraging-to-extinction? On the other hand (and this is the argument this post focuses on), if foragers did become tool-users, it seems likely that evolution gave them something important to do with their lives: they needed food, and they needed to protect themselves against other foragers with whom they may have wanted resources. In other words, the very fact that our ancestors started to use tools would seem to be strongly indicative that they had already developed an intelligence sufficient for tool use. It's unlikely then that the intelligence which allowed our ancestors to be tool-users arose later, once foragers started using them. I haven't found a good overview of these debates but they don't seem to hinge on contentious philosophical questions. I would be very interested, though, to find out who's right on both questions.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Why focus on this question so much?</strong></p><br><p>Pinker's book is in large part driven by the following question: Why did the evolutionary world and its culture (as we know it today) emerge in such a short time? Given that some forager-to-forager interactions already required considerable intelligence, why did evolution not push people in that direction much <em>earlier</em>? I find this question very interesting on its own\xe2\x80\x94I find it an excellent example of how asking the wrong questions about the past can lead us to wrong conclusions about the future. There have been various attempts to answer this question, and to my mind all of them haven't really yielded fruit. This post is my attempt to try to dig a little bit deeper.</p><br><p><strong>The problem with saying that the hominins were selected for intelligence</strong></p><br><p>One way of thinking about this question is to ask: Why were humans selected for intelligence?</p><br><p>This is a fairly standard human-evolution-theory question, and if "intelligence" and "tool use" are tightly related, a number of standard theories have already been proposed (as previously discussed):</p><br><ul>
<li><em>S</em>-<em>R</em>: Intelligence increases the ability to take resources from others, which allows access to more food, which allows you to have children. Note that this includes "taking" resources from your fellow humans too. So far, <em>this</em> doesn't seem too controversial.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>Co-evolution</em>: I'd guess most readers here are aware of the view that intelligence (or at least increased intelligence) was selected <em>for</em> cultural intelligence rather than the other way around. While I won't discuss this here, the current best-guess view is that increased intelligence gave both greater success in competing with other foragers for scarce resources, but <em>also</em> opened the door for cultural intelligence (i.e., the ability to pass on cultural information to youroffs via the environment).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><em>Horses and chariots</em>: Tool use is in large part a direct result of our evolutionary past. It seems that our ancestor's need to communicate (in addition to the need for food) meant we were selecting for brains which could process and encode information. But this is more or less the same view on which horses and chariots were selected for: more efficient means of communication, more efficient means of moving around, etc.</li>
</ul><br><p>If these three theories explain all of it, what's left? I've personally been a bit of an advocate of a fourth theory, which I've outlined in recent posts but won't really summarize here:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
