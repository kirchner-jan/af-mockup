H. Eason and J. H. Chudley. The experiment was conducted at the University College London, and involved 498 people (two years only). People had to sit in a room with another person (a confederate) who was not aware that the experiment was going on. In many trials, the confederate either passed around a glass of water (contagious; cholera) or not (inoculation). </p><br><p>However, the two years weren't exactly the same, so the control and experiment groups are not quite the same people.</p><br><p>The first year of the experiment was done with a group of students.</p><br><p>The second was done with a professional group.</p><br><p>The third was done with volunteers.</p><br><p>The fourth was done over a series of several days with the same person repeatedly.</p><br><p>The fifth was done with several different confederates.</p><br><p>The results of that first year (first experiment), as well as the control experiment is that the majority of participants were able to catch the disease from the cholera.</p><br><p>This may seem surprising but in fact it isn't (at least from what I understand).  </p><br><p>In a control experiment people in the control group, who were deliberately chosen to act as control for the experiment, were mostly unable to catch the cholera on the day of the experiment. </p><br><p>In the actual experiment, there may have been a slight tendency to catch the chola in the cholera group but, when you consider the size of the sample, the difference was insignificant. </p><br><p>An interesting thing to note is the change of social behaviours.</p><br><p>With the students and the professional group, the cholera passed around in the same way as people would in a normal hospital. People acted the same as if they didn't know what cholera was and were immune from it.</p><br><p>However, with the volunteers, cholera passed round as if people didn't act like they didn't know it, as a social convention.</p><br><p>One surprising thing that the study found is that an inoculation against the cholera reduced the spread. </p><br><p>The researchers found that over 20 years after the experiment, almost 50% of the volunteers who had received the cholera were positive for antibodies against cholera, compared to only 13% of those who hadn't.</p><br><p>This is interesting that the more inoculated individuals did not get infected by cholera in the experiment, even though cholera was a social disease that was passed around the same in the experiment.</p><br><p>This experiment was replicated some years later by H. T. Low (1957) at McGill University, Canada (replication). The results were roughly the same as the original experiment. However, in the replication, cholera was passed around without use of gloves or masks, which may have affected the results.</p><br><p>The idea that cholera is a social disease that is passed around as a social convention is probably more important than the result. But there are other interesting things in the results.</p><br><p>Some conclusions: </p><br><ul>
<li>The cholera was not spread the same way as in the control experiment, where people acted as if they didnotknow it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>When a cholera vaccine was given to the volunteers, the cholara decreased from over 20% to 13%, which was significant by p= 0.0001</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some of the cholera vaccine recipients got the cholera and therefore could be considered positive controls. However, the results were not significantly different from the ones in the control experiment (p= 0.06).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People who had gotten in the cholara group had a larger average area of involvement in the experiment than people who hadn't, a likely indication of being positive controls in each experiment. </li>
</ul><br><p>The replication attempt found the cholara went from 13% to 42%, but this may just be methodological, as it is an indirect measure.</p><br><p>I also did further research on the replication to understand how the results of the replication differed from the original.</p><br><p>The results of the replication may also have been an artefact of the lack of masks and gloves in the replication and that it was a clinical trial rather than a natural experiment. </p><br><ul>
<li>This study may have been conducted in an unusual way.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This may be an old study, and so if we really want to replicate now, it may be better to conduct in a laboratory or another well-controlled setting.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The experiment was not designed to follow the rules of natural experiments.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>In an unusual way, many people chose to be controls, to make up for the lack of masking.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Also a few people volunteered as controls and then did not participate in the experiment.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Participants had been encouraged to go to sleep while the experimenter waited in the conference room to be sure they all got enough sleep.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Even if the replication had been able to rule out the effect of the experiment being clinical rather than natural experiment, I would have liked the replication to be conducted with the same protocol it was conducted with.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>I was surprised at how many different forms of information about the trial were leaked.</li>
</ul><br><p>For more information, here is a write up: "Do cholera social diseases spread just as fast as flu?". It covers most of my questions and thoughts on the replication.</p><br><p>Cross posted to less wrong</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
