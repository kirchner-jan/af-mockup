That is, we can never be sure a specific, verifiable explanation actually describes the universe. To be sure, it is impossible to do this at present; our available evidence may not allow such certainty. However, if our existing beliefs are wrong, we may be capable of being mistaken into believing something that isn't true.</p><br><p>I use a particular set of beliefs, as the following discussion illustrates, based on reading:</p><br><ul>
<li>The "Extensive Multiverses" paper by Douglas Everett and Frank Tipler (http://​​arxiv.org/​​abs/​​astro-ph/​​0309384), which suggests that most likely the universe is larger than we have been led to believe. See section 1.4.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The "Cosmic Perspective" by David Deutsch, which illustrates that we can make sense of even a large Universe on a human scale, not in terms of "small" and "large" quantities, but as a finite space of "large" quantities.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The book "The Big Picture" by Peter Atkins, which explains the size of the Universe rather than just how few times it has existed, so that it doesn't seem to be limited by the number of moments of creation, only the space available. And he demonstrates the relevance of this idea in human history.</li>
</ul><br><p>It's also worth thinking of what we know <em>before</em> we have evidence for the universe to be larger, such as the inflationary model of the Big Bang, which suggests that the Big Bang, rather than a moment of creation, was the creation, and all earlier events in the universe were like moments.</p><br><p><strong>1. Evidence for the Universe being Large</strong></p><br><p>One reason for thinking the universe might be large, is that it is difficult for us to imagine the Earth (or at least, humanity) without access to light that has travelled hundreds of millions of light years. And the very concept of such an enormous distance, or any kind of distance, is difficult for us. But there is more to the matter than our ignorance.</p><br><p>First is our ignorance of the absolute limit for the distance light can travel. This estimate is highly uncertain, and is dependent on several assumptions.</p><br><p>1A: The most accurate estimates for the age of the universe so far suggest a minimum age of 1 − 2 billion years, but this estimate is very noisy and subject to revision.</p><br><p>1B: There is an upper bound of around 70 billion years, based purely on physical limits</p><br><p>It was determined that the age of the Universe <em>in this light frame</em> is between 1 and 2 billion years. From this the upper bound can be deduced (given a conservative estimate for the accuracy of this number). From 1A it can be concluded that if all other assumptions are true, the upper bound should be very large. From 1B alone, the answer to question 1) is highly uncertain, so even with large errors in our estimates the most likely upper bound would still be around 70 billion years. This upper bound is much smaller than the numbers that have been commonly used in discussions of the universe being "very large".</p><br><p>Second is the uncertainty in the estimates for the age. Because the age of the earth is known precisely, we know that if we see the same pattern of life emerging that the human race has (i.e. the same complex machinery being used to create tools to create tools, and then developing to greater sophistication) at a certain age, say around 1 - 2 billion years, we can conclude that this pattern of evolution did not go on longer and further. The fact that we know the age of the Earth is crucial from this perspective, as the evolution of the universe can be traced back to just a few simple equations of physics.</p><br><p>So the first limit on distance is an estimated range of 1 to 70 billion years; however, the limit on our understanding is 1 − 2 billion, given that we have seen no further evolution in light of the complexity of our world. Secondly, even on the most generous assumptions about the limits of distance, they could still only reach up to 70 billion years rather than thousands. This would not make the universe large, unless humanity had existed a very long time. But there is another limit to distance that is much shorter:</p><br><p>2A: There are not significant limits on _future _events. The limits are on _past _events.</p><br><p>So if we could look back at the past light-speed limit to the extent that it can travel in both directions, we could verify that there is nothing new. But if there are no limits to the future (as it seems that we should assume there are none), then we can deduces that the Universe is in principle very large; in practice, though, this only suggests that the scale of the universe in light-speed terms might be much greater than the light-speed limit, and in turn, that the universe is very large in space, not in time.</p><br><p>However, it is likely that there are limits to the future as our current understanding allows them to exist, and we can't easily think about the far future, given that it is likely to be much longer than the current limits, and that we may be able to see it in full. So our current estimates, assuming the limit of infinity, is not a valid limit, and is only a useful estimate in a theoretical sense. This suggests that we are limited to calculating things in terms of only our present evidence.</p><br><p>So, if we cannot know how large the universe is in time, the only way to estimate the number of time-steps in space is by estimating how large humanity may be in the future.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
