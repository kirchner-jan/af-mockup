<li>Is there a way of getting from here to there, given only this information? What about from there to here? Or, if you have infinite information, what is the limit as we approach infinity?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How do we know that this formula gives the correct answer in the case where one of the assumptions is false?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is more, what kind of question is whether or not P!=NP? (Is P!=NP computable? Can P!=NP be proved or refuted?") Or, what does it mean to have some proof or decision algorithm or mathematical theory that behaves this way (or that)?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What is the limit of the probability that an intelligent agent assigns to some event A, when you use some mathematical theorem to prove A?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Can you know for sure when you have found a solution to some problem before?</li>
</ul><br><p>I have my own thoughts on these questions, however, and before I begin talking about them, I want to talk about a few principles.</p><br><ul>
<li>The only thing that counts as mathematics is formal systems (such as Peano Arithmetic), and <em>only</em> formally systems. You can talk about formal systems in terms of theorems and provable statements of those systems, but this is not 'probability'. In real life, even if both parties know something mathematical, it may be that I'm confident in my mathematical knowledge but not confident in your mathematical knowledge. This is often the case. Of course, we might still <em>try</em> to infer probabilities under uncertainty, given some reasonable conditions (such as, for example, some reasonable conditions on my prior knowledge of mathematical subjects.) But this has some problems.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>__I want to keep mathematics as an intellectual endeavor, rather than just a practical one.___</li>
</ul><br><p>For example, suppose there's a certain <em>moral imperative</em> that tells us to keep mathematics as a scientific subject, a topic to learn about in school, rather than a merely practical one. If you want to do a lot of science you should do math, right? So, we decide to go all the way down to the lowest levels of our physical universe, and I get to study physics while you study how to infer probabilities. If I ever run into a problem which isn't within the reach of modern physics, then I can ask you for a probability distribution over the outcomes of any possible physical experiment, and you can then study which experiments in fact do/\xe2\x80\x8bdo not occur (after making some assumptions and/\xe2\x80\x8bor giving up some degrees of freedom).</p><br><p>Now, consider a different case: Suppose I have already a certain amount of mathematical knowledge <em>which I can use in real life</em>. You have all of your own mathematical knowledge which is <em>so much more than I have</em>, that I think that it's <em>not even useful in real life</em> to use your mathematical knowledge to solve your real life problems as you know them. In this case, I can't even hope to build <em>inference strategies</em> that will infer a probability that I could eventually solve my real life problems using my own mathematical knowledge. I can't even ask you for a solution of these inference strategies (which I know how to build).</p><br><p>This principle has a lot of pragmatic advantages, but I also think there's an aesthetic appeal to mathematical subjectivism. We can say that mathematics is an intellectual pursuit <em>by definition</em>:</p><br><ul>
<li>Mathematics is what you use formally systems to prove.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There's no <em>a priori _knowledge that is justified in _practical</em> terms, and no _a prior _intellectual pursuit that is justified in practical terms.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Mathematical problems are just problems, to be solved.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It might be useful at times to have a certain amount of <em>practical _knowledge about a mathematical subject which gives us _some _amount of _practical</em> understanding of the subject, but this is just a practical question, and the reason we care about it is <em>justified in</em> practical terms.</li>
</ul><br><p>The problem is that these days, there's a lot of practical knowledge about math that could be useful in real life, and it _is _useful in real life. People use it for lots of things other than figuring out which questions are important enough to be worth taking seriously.</p><br><p>The upshot is that there are a lot of "problems" that are <em>actually problems</em>:</p><br><p>And there are also a lot of practical consequences that can't ever be calculated or predicted, because knowing the question doesn't tell you anything about the answer.</p><br><ul>
<li>I want to be able to talk about <em>mathematical truths</em>.</li>
</ul><br><p>If there's no object-level difference between the statement "this is a physical entity" and "this is a statement that I know how to prove is correct within formal systems P" then I don't really have a way to talk about a physical entity. If the physical entity doesn't have a "physical part", it might still have a "mathematical part": in particular, all real world physical entities have an ideal mathematical description. But if I'm talking about a mathematical object of type M, such as "this formula is provable under the Peano axioms", then all I really have is an <em>ideal _formula, which has a lot many "mathematical truths" associated with it. So my talk of a _mathematical truth</em> in the case of real world physical entities, requires <em>mathematical</em> <em>truths:</em> I have to look at the ideal formula, and figure out which formal systems P it's provable under. But real <em>physical</em> entities never have a _real _formula. Is there some way of talking about a physical entity that doesn't rely on talking about physical entities at all?</p><br><p>The only way I can see of talking about something that's not a physical entity at all is by relying on provability under mathematical systems. Of course, I could start talking about physical entities anyway, and make _some _use of logical information, but then I start asking questions like "where is the ideal formula embedded? What's the difference between mathematical proofs and real world physical proofs? What's the relationship between ideal mathematical objects and real world physical objects?" etc. I want to go back to asking questions that just have to do with the physical world, the same way I do when I'm not thinking particularly carefully about any particular model of the physical world (as we all do from time to time)</p><br><p>And the same with any other _practical _information I can actually use. Of course, if I want to know how to predict some particular real world physical phenomenon given some particular physical hypothesis, the idea is to actually _implement _that idea.</p><br><ul>
<li>Probability distributions are <em>about the world.</em></li>
</ul><br><p>It is <em>a fact about</em> the world that there's a certain amount of probability in a mathematical system. This fact is not part of the world, and trying to justify this fact in terms of physics risks violating the principles above. In particular, it often feels like I know this fact, that there's something about the way I see the world that tells me that my beliefs are justified (in terms of being in harmony with this physical reality, which has some particular "physical law" associated with it). But it's not true. The mathematical system is what justifies my belief, not some other part of the world.</p><br><p>A related point: We learn about the world on a number of different levels. Sometimes, we just learn the facts (eg, whether this apple is on the table). Other times, we also learn to _interpret _facts (eg, that I know the position and momentum of this apple). It may sometimes be useful to consider this process of interpreting facts together with the process of acquiring them from the environment, as two separate "learning process" which are happening at different levels of abstraction. When you learn the facts about this physical reality, you acquire some information about how to interpret them. And when you learn about how to interpret the facts, you acquire some degree of _mathematical _knowledge: you know that this physical interpretation obeys some sort of mathematical laws; you know that one thing implies another, etc. (On second thought, I just now realized that this second phrase was confused: I'm trying to say that the "facts" are just the mathematical laws.)</p><br><p>"A probability distribution is <em>about your observations</em>."</p><br><p>I like the idea of probability distributions being <em>about observations in particular</em>. That is to say, I <em>like</em> this equation (although I don't quite agree with it). This is why I like probabilities:</p><br><ul>
<li>You can calculate your expected utility.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>You can assign priors.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>You actually _have _evidence: if you look at some part of the physical world that was previously consistent with some alternative hypotheses, it'll seem to support those hypotheses more.</li>
