</ul><br><p>Summary</p><br><p>In part one, we look at the correlations between IQ and social class during the late premodern period. These correlations suggest that IQ does not reflect general ability but class background. But, from other historical sources, we learn that the upper class was more innovative and had greater intellectual interests. These early indications that IQ doesn't predict class background are consistent with the idea that class structure reflects IQ.</p><br><p>In part two, we examine how IQ developed in the twentieth century. We learn that it wasn't from the upper class but due to the lower class's educational opportunities. We also discover that the lower class benefited most from IQ tests because they measure general ability, while the middle and upper classes were primarily helped by their IQ tests measuring class background.</p><br><p>Introduction</p><br><p>This essay summarizes Charles Murray's 1994 book <em>Human Accomplishment</em>, the first in his proposed "sequence of monographs [exploring] the social history of the United States leading up to the present."</p><br><p>I decided to read and reread <em>Human Accomplimation</em> before continuing with the series, because the book is a treasure trove of original research on a host of intellectual subjects. The book also teaches you a lot about American society without telling you what you'll enjoy reading about.</p><br><p>The book is a bit academic and dry, although the writing is engagingly clear and concise. I found myself quickly turning to Wikipedia for confirmation because I had no other high-quality sources for these research topics. The only trouble is that Murray sometimes has trouble defining his terms for you.</p><br><p>I also found the book very useful for explaining my own interest in American intellectual history to my friends. I also learned something more specific about Charles Murray. He's <em>awesome</em>.</p><br><p>You can order a used copy or download a PDF of the book here.</p><br><p>Part One: Intelligence and <em>Class</em> Structure</p><br><p>The intelligence of some populations at some periods is correlated with the economic status of their members at that period, and we call this correlation "social status." To estimate how intelligent a modern population is relative to pre-scientific human intelligences, we use this data. Intelligence has been defined as "the ability to make successful use of one's opportunities in society."</p><br><p><strong>Summary</strong>: The upper class during early modernity was more innovative, but the correlation between its economic status and intelligence was weaker than other classes' with similar economic status.</p><br><p>In the first section we look at what we know about pre-industrial human intelligence. We start off with what we can infer from the few sources that exist from the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries. Then we turn to the data we have on people in pre-scientific societies.</p><br><p>We look at pre-industrial population IQ and social status by referring to data from societies before the Scientific Revolution. Data for this section comes largely from the work of Charles Murray.</p><br><p>Charles Murray's research on IQ led him to think that intelligence in general "was strongly correlated with life satisfaction and health."1 He also believed that IQ was positively correlated with "social welfare, including income, education, and job security."2</p><br><p>Social status is a different measure from intelligence. It is generally defined as power, dominance, recognition, and trust. People who rise in society through these means gain the respect of others, and by extension, gain more power generally. The intelligence of these individuals may be low, but the social status of these individuals is high because they act as enforcers of the structure of class structure.</p><br><p>We could say that intelligence is a subset of social status with the highest positive correlation. But we have some data to suggest that social status and intelligence are importantly different. We will show that this is consistent with what we know about the role of social status in modern times.</p><br><p>High social status appears to correlate more strongly with innovation than with other forms of intelligence. We have four sources of evidence for this conclusion.</p><br><p>First, the people who tend to become the most successful in modern society generally have high social status and low intelligence. Third-generation immigrants are very successful but often described as lacking cultural ties. Second-generation immigrants are at the very bottom of the economic ladder, and yet their children go on to graduate college, make more money, and live lives of great quality. Murray describes them as "the bright elite, the "super-assimilates," the upward-social entrepreneurs."3</p><br><p>Second, we see evidence for higher IQ being associated with higher social status from two sources. First, in the 1950s, the most famous and most successful people were generally known to have extremely high levels of social status, and generally low IQ. Second, there are "IQ tests" that have been found to be strongly correlated with social status. These tests are now called IQ tests and measure not intelligence generally but the "g" factor, "the broad, generalized cognitive ability as measured in the WAIS test."4 IQ tests were discovered by J.D. Flynn, and have their genesis in the intelligence wars of the 1950s.5</p><br><p>Third, we can use the data we have about pre-industrial societies to learn more about the role of class structure in intellectual capacity. In his first research study, Murray finds that the average social status in pre-industrial societies was more strongly or significantly correlated with the average IQ than was the average social status with those pre-industrial societies. So even in our pre-industrial era, the class structure and income had a stronger impact on intelligence than did social status. Third-generation immigrant children of immigrants tend to retain the intelligence and skills of their parents. So social status contributes to IQ even in a modern society where children can be selected for high social status without having been trained from birth and are not allowed to interact with the lower classes.6</p><br><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The upper class prior to the Scientific Revolution had higher levels of both intelligence and social status, and the correlation between the two was weaker than the high level of social and intelligence in people with equivalent economic status.</p><br><p>1 Giftedness and Genius: Two Factors of Human Potential, p. 21.

Again, we start off by investigating the historical data. In particular, we look at how pre-industrial IQ differs among pre-industrial classes. We look at the history of class structure in early modern society through the lens of IQ.</p><br><p>We turn to IQ tests. What do we know about them?</p><br><p>What Do IQ Tests Measure?</p><br><p>IQ tests measure intelligence, because they are based on tests created by scientists studying human intellectual performance. To administer these tests, psychologists usually use standard verbal, performance, or 'objective' measures such as a computer screen containing standardized images or a 'problem' for the test subject to solve, or tasks designed to measure certain abilities such as mathematical, verbal, or visual reasoning.7</p><br><p>When intelligence tests developed out of the tests created by scientists, what was being measured? The tests were designed so that they would be of the greatest use for diagnosing and remedial action, rather than for predicting which people <em>and specific activities</em> would be especially high-performing in general.</p><br><p>This is called 'task-based' tests that measures performance in a specific situation. A great deal of these tests had to do with measuring an <em>individual's _ability to solve problems posed by others. The person being tested is usually unaware of how they're being tested beforehand, and the problem is not always the same every time. A more important test, known as the 'closed-book' test, does not have this limitation, and requires you to write out a written problem in your own words from the instructions provided. The results from these tests might be combined to develop an _overall</em> estimate of the <em>average</em> of all people's individual level in the relevant aspects of intelligence.</p><br><p>Once an intelligence test has been put through rigorous tests or analysis, it comes'ready to use,' but only the raw results are useful, not the underlying metrics for assessing relative intelligence. IQ tests are useful for the job _because _some _average _of the test scores correlates with human and organizational performance. But 'average' results for the tests are not the results you need when you are in a decision making situation. For that you need another measure \xe2\x80\x93 a percentile \xe2\x80\x93 a percentile that takes into account both the average and the variance.</p><br><p>The average of a batch of 100 scores is higher than the 50th percentile among scores because the upper half of people had higher scores than the lower half. But the upper half also might have had higher scores because they are more intelligent while the lower half are less intelligent. So for a high ranking individual one must look at the _relative _scores to determine what percentile they are in. This is accomplished by comparing results to other people with similar test scores.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
