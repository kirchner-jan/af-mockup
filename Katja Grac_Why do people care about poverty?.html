<li>Human beings seem to care about a lot of things.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People (or other animals) often don't have enough resources.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Having enough things is often hard or impossible.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People sometimes feel that having enough things is a fundamental human right.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People are more likely to have access to poverty-related information when they are poor; they're more likely to be made aware of various poverty-related goods and services, and to be asked by poor people about what they think of them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People often care about things that other people don't care about.</li>
</ul><br><p>This post mostly doesn't address any of these reasons. I won't take a position on how much they matter; instead, I'm just going to flag they all matter.</p><br><p>Instead, I'm going to go with this one question which is my favourite to think about in this context: "If there were no poverty, how much would people here care about that?"</p><br><p>The main reason I focus on this question is that it's a straightforward one, and it tends to go better than most others, largely because it forces us to pin down what we're after. It also means that we can compare answers: if there are very big advantages we would still like everyone to have, and a lot of people are interested in poverty. If the opposite is true, we should think of the issue as less important. I think this question is the best tool I've found for that.</p><br><p>To be clear, I'm not saying we should agree or disagree on this question. It is also pretty hard for me to imagine how someone would have an opinion on it. It's more of a starting point \xe2\x80\x93 a starting reason to even wonder. I think it's very important to do so, because even though poverty is less salient (at least from the perspective of my brain) than most human experiences, it still matters. </p><br><p>This post contains the background. </p><br><p>Some contexts in which human beings seem to care very much about poverty:</p><br><ul>
<li>In poor places like Nigeria and Bangladesh, there is a lot of human suffering.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>At least some humans seem to not only have a strong moral concern for poverty, but a desire to help.</li>
</ul><br><p>I think what these examples imply is that one major reason human beings seem to have some interest in poverty, is that that concern can be easily leveraged into actions that help. And I think it is quite common for people to have some moral concern for poverty but for this concern not to end up in actions that help. As a simple example, many people I know care a lot about poverty, but seem to treat other things in this category as less important. As a more extreme example, consider people who care about starvation in the Third World, but not at all about hunger at home. </p><br><p>I believe that to a first approximation, any moral concern of yours can be leveraged into a moral concern for others; and even if not, you can build on it, in a way that creates value. The question then is how many times we already have this lever in hand. For now, I think I know people who care a lot about hunger (for example, most people at Effective Animal Activism), and those people are usually well aware of things around them that they care about that I don't know well about. So I'm pretty excited about the idea.</p><br><p>The second reason I think this question matters is because it seems to provide empirical information about what other people care about.</p><br><p>As I have argued in other contexts, we should have reason to be skeptical of theories which claim that people feel things in different ways from us. They might give weird answers, but they usually make weird statements about reality. This seems less true if instead you ask for people's answers (as I did here), rather than about what actions the answers imply. If most people in the world care very differently from each other, and very differently from the people in rich countries, this is some evidence against my claim above. This also makes my claim seem less bold: if everyone around the world cares the same way, maybe more broadly, then there's a wider range of things people feel bad about.</p><br><p>So in thinking about poverty, I'm mainly focusing on things like:</p><br><ul>
<li>What experiences do poor people have? How does that affect their level of wealth?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What do you see when you go to poor countries?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Can this concern in general be leveraged into something that could help many more people than usual?</li>
</ul><br><p>But there are two questions which are important to ask:</p><br><ul>
<li>If poverty were never a problem, how much more important would other efforts become?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If poverty was not a problem, what would different groups of people spend their time on?</li>
</ul><br><p>These questions come up a lot both when thinking about the overall state of a given issue (does poverty matter?), and when thinking about specific efforts people might try to make (what specific policies could help the most?).</p><br><p>In the next section I'll be asking the first question. And after that, I'll mostly focus on asking the second question.</p><br><p>Part 1: What is one's basic level of caring about poverty?</p><br><p>I've had some thoughts about this \xe2\x80\x93 how do other people feel about poverty? But I think the question is the right starting point, and I don't think I have any deep inside view. Instead, I'll be summarising some considerations from outside view before going on to question whether there can be leveraged actions.</p><br><p>In general I think a lot of people care pretty much the same amount about the world; more specifically, they care about how resources are managed.</p><br><p>I think there are some cases where people's basic level of concern is different. For example:</p><br><ul>
<li>There are rich people, and there are some poor people. There are enough rich people to be able to support the needs of all the poor people.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some people's basic level is that there are different amounts of rich and poor. They can mostly be supported by the rich, so are basically indifferent.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some people's feeling is that a given amount of rich is more justifiable than those of other people.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some think that rich/\xe2\x80\x8bpoor is unfair and that if there is inequality, the poorest should benefit more than the richest. This seems to have more of an "other people should be happy too" vibe to it, so that part's harder to find a good summary.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There are situations which seem obviously unequal, like a slave and a free-rider problem.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There are situations that seem equally unequal but in which the poor have access to more information and other opportunities than the rich.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some groups in society are more productive per person than others.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some groups in a given society care much more about certain aspects of human experience than others.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Most people are not in dire situations. Even if someone were, I think they would be less likely to be able to leverage their basic level of caring into a moral concern.</li>
</ul><br><p>This is why I started off by focusing on the first question. I think it is a good place to start thinking about questions like how bad different poverty is, and whether poverty could matter for anything else. I've found different people to agree on a first approximation; that is, a first estimate that one can use.</p><br><p>From this first approximation:</p><br><ul>
<li>Some people do consider other things important: health, education, the environment, economic equality, animals, and, among humans, personal connection and personal growth.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Some aspects of the first approximation matter less: for example, health, the environment, (and in particular, animals) and personal connection and personal development.</li>
</ul><br><p>These differences of basic value suggest three reasons why some issues (which we could call "human rights problems") seem to matter more than others:</p><br><ul>
<li>Issues which are more important in our personal lives.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Issues over which we have more control (this does not apply to health &amp; the environment, they are also important\xe2\x80\x94but they are also important to rich and well-off people).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Issues which seem more important to other people.</li>
</ul><br><p>My best guess on the order of importance goes like this:</p><br><p><strong>Human Rights Problems:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>People dying: especially deaths from disease.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People dying from being wronged</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>People not having enough things: from starvation, to homelessness, to being unable to earn a living in an exploitative way, to being abused, etc.</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Human Relationships Problems: </strong></p><br><ul>
<li>People not getting to know each other.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A lack of connection between people and the world around them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>A feeling of disconnection from others.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Not having enough things to hold on to, or knowing how to relate in a strong way to things.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Not getting to try or fail. I know some people consider this the most important thing in the world.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Not being able to be a strong, competent or confident person, for a variety of reasons.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Nature, the Environment, the Animals:</strong></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Being able to care about animals, and in particular, in a way which leverages a basic concern for others.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Being able or at least considering trying to help the less fortunate/\xe2\x80\x8bmore dependent.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Ability to make decisions about the natural world.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Ability (or at least interest) in learning about it.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Not doing these things due to lack of time, or of other resources.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Not just people dying\xe2\x80\x94the natural environment can go in various ways. </li>
