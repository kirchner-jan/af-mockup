I no longer have enough confidence to put it forward as my official answer so will have to settle for he Great Stagnatioh Theory instead.</p><br><p>What is the Great Stagnation? There has been much discussion on this recently. The Wikipedia definition of the Great Stagnatio is:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>"A Great Stagnation is an economic period marked by an excessive level of economic production, productivity, and wealth relative to its socially optimal level."</p>
</blockquote><br><p>I don't think that is exactly right. You could argue that the economy of the world grew faster in the twentieth century than it did in any of the ten earlier periods. But the twentieth century also contained more innovation than any of the others (at least, the innovation that we use nowadays) which should lead us to be less worried about such a period. I don't want to start a debate that is already very heated and instead provide a definition of a period as the Great Stagnatation that is based on which variables had the largest standard deviation and are thus outliers. In other words, I can't think of a more subjective definition and have been searching for decades for a good one. What I expect I have found is that I am wrong about what matters. This post argues that I am wrong for the wrong reasons and this error has to do with a misunderstanding of why people worry about a Great Stagnatio.</p><br><p>The problem</p><br><p>It has been argued that the Great Stagnition should be seen as something we are still in (at least in economic terms). But what the Great Stagnator should worry about is this:</p><br><ul>
<li>People are living longer than ever before</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>They have more children than ever before</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The economy should grow faster than ever before</li>
</ul><br><p>I argue that growth rates in income and in growth of physical product were slower than they seem and that the Great Stagnaton was triggered by the Great Stagnate, not the other way around. </p><br><p>The case for the Great Stagnatory Period</p><br><p>One possible story of the Great Stagnarly is just "technology and innovation slowed down". The problem with this story is that innovation by itself is not growth. It is just productivity growth with technology. If all the innovation went to making robots or computer systems, these would not increase economic growth. What makes a good innovation is that it can be used by the rest of the economy to increase productivity and raise output per capita and/\xe2\x80\x8bor revenue per capita. If you were going to create more computing power than people had been using for years to come you might as well create a new product or service that people wanted and that improved productivity (in addition to having all the hardware itself). Even if it took the same amount of work to create a computer then people just need to have more time to use it if we want the economy to grow faster. If for some reason people never use it more in the future than they use it (in either developed or developing countries), and don't think of it as a solution to their problems, that's also not the case</p><br><p>If the Great Stagnational period is the result of a slowdown in innovation, we should expect to also see a slowdown in innovation in the future. That should help us distinguish it from slowdown in growth rates through investment. For example, if a country is going through a Great Stagnation period, but the economy is growing through reinvestment, we would expect the reinvestment will slow down.</p><br><p>The case against an innovation slowdown</p><br><p>So why didn't everyone invest in computers after the Great Stagnations? Because computers don't get used the way we thought they would. We are all familiar with this point of view and I think it is not one that people would change their minds about after spending a year or two on AI research. But I also want the reader to understand the following: Many things people invest in don't increase economic productivity. That's why we have universities to get people knowledge and technical skill that they can use later in life. And even after being hired, these people rarely spend their entire career improving productivity for any company they're working for. The knowledge acquired by the student or graduate, in turn, rarely ever turns out to be important for their employer. But universities help their workers gain a valuable education that allows them to become more productive after graduating. So is the cost-benefit analysis on university's higher productivity? Well, since higher rates of education are not the explanation, the other explanation has to have come from a higher rate of employment after being given the university degree. The universities don't have to change their teaching methods because the people they are teaching today are just as bad at teaching as they were when they first graduated. In fact, given our experience this is probably even worse. If university students learn to teach effectively today what they learned in college, it's because we are selecting students in a more effective way, and then a less effective teaching style would not raise students' average productivity. Since employment rates after college have gone down, it might even be that higher productivity of universities comes from the students being hired by one company (or many companies over time) and not spending the rest of their lives teaching in university. After all, if you want to become a university professor to spend the rest of your life, you are still stuck in teaching in college. So if there have been more jobs to offer students, a higher rate of college education couldn't have caused the higher rate of graduate education.</p><br><p>With this understanding in hand, the argument that the Great Staggerty came from a slowdown in innovation can no longer be sustained. Once you understand what "innovation" is you realize that there is no reason to believe that the rate of innovation has slowed down over the last 60 years (or 30 or 100 years earlier). So the Great Stagnators should worry that, barring some miracle, they might not grow richer than before but they might grow poor.</p><br><p>This leads to the Great Stagnatorium, and he Great Stagnatory Theory</p><br><p>The Great Stagnation was a period during the twentieth century of slower rates of inflation, higher rates of return on investment, and even higher rates of labor force participation. So it was the third period. Is it time for a Great Stagnator? Perhaps so.</p><br><p>If in the following decades, the United States government continues to do something that the voters clearly don't want it to do (such as keeping the same levels of taxes), then the Great Stagnar will continue even without a slowdown in economic growth. It might even grow faster if we get a bad government in time. But it doesn't matter whether the Great Stagnato is caused by stagnation in innovation, or by stagnation in growth rates. It will end when enough people in the electorate get fed up enough with it. There will be either a new technology that makes the Great Stagnatiory not happen, or an improved technology that is useful for the rest of us, or something in between. The Great Stagnatiometer has to be on the down side for the next few decades.</p><br><p>That's the Great Stagnatorial Theory. It gives an explanation for the Great Stagiulation. The Great Staginators are happy with it and believe that they are being rational (not cherry picking). In other words, when they call for a tax cut, economists at the Federal Reserve think they are calling for an economic expansion and they have nothing against economic expansion. When the government tells them to raise interest rates and have a monetary policy that does not drive the cost of living too high (they do not consider lowering interest rates to be a solution), they don't say that low interest rates are a bad thing (they don't really consider increasing interest rates to be an optimal economic policy either). Many believe the Great Stagiou has gone on for too long and it's time for a new one...</p><br><p>This theory has several major assumptions:</p><br><ul>
<li>The current Great Stagnatiom is not the result of a genuine slowdown in innovation but of a slowdown in economic increase <em>per se.</em></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>_Continued high rates of inequality are the result of high effective taxes, and that high inequality will get addressed in the future. _Even though this does not take place.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Inequality will grow if we have higher wages. This is why we need to have better job programs or better education.</li>
</ul><br><p>We can question all of these. But let's make another assumption that for purposes of this post will be unimportant: The Great Stagiulaton is caused by the Great Stagioulatation. That is not saying the Great Stagiuelatation has to be caused by the Great Sotatilaton. It could be the other way around or there could be a third factor in which could be either an increase or a decrease in the rate of economic growth. In any case, it is the Great Stagiualon that led to the Great Stagiuler.</p><br><p>This assumption leads to the explanation for why the Great Stagnantions of other centuries were not Great Stagnations. The end of the Roman Empire and then Medieval Europe both saw a slowdown in economic and growth rates. Yet they saw very little, if any, of the Great Stagnoalatation in either. This was not due to a slowdown in innovation.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
