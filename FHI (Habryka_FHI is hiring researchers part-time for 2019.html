</ul><br><p><em>(Crossposted on the EA Forum)</em></p><br><p>FHI is looking for top talent to join our research team on long-term catastrophic risks, especially ones that may arise from AI systems. We are especially interested in applicants for whom work at FHI could be a good use of time, or who could make a good use of FHI as a place to do good research. </p><br><p>The deadline to apply is <strong>2021-03-02</strong>, 12:00 (PDT). But the earlier you send in an application, the sooner we will contact you. We think this is a fantastic opportunity that we need to make available, so please apply as soon as you can.</p><br><p>What is FHI? </p><br><p>FHI is a research institute located in the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford, within the University of Oxford's broader-based research programme for existential risk. Our goal is to identify, investigate, and make robustly good decisions how we can best reduce global catastrophic risk. </p><br><p>We are currently run by two Research Directors, Nick Bostrom and Anders Sandberg, with additional help from several researchers under other staff from around the world (US, UK, Russia, India, Sweden, etc). Our team is growing, and we have plans to grow significantly more over the next few years.  </p><br><p>For further information about FHI see our website https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b, and for a detailed list of research we've done since our launch in the beginning of 2018, see our research page on the website. </p><br><p>How do you apply if <strong>you are __an __academic?</strong></p><br><p>FHI is only interested in applicants who:</p><br><ul>
<li>Would have already accepted our standard Academic offer or are in the final stages of the process and are about to make their final decision, or</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are already in another organisation, or</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are already a PhD student or postdoc at Oxford or another institution that could be considered for collaboration with FHI.</li>
</ul><br><p>When you have decided you're interested in working for us, please fill out this form.</p><br><p>What is __a part-timer?____ __There is no strict rule about how often you should be part-time or full-time. You can spend some of your time working with us here at FHI (including a substantial portion of your time working on our part-time research projects) and some of your time on your own research outside of us. Depending on funding and how much you are able to help us in our projects and other stuff, we will often start out with you working at full-time. </p><br><p>__How much money do you __get?</p><br><p><strong>We have several different payment plans. </strong></p><br><p>If you are part-time and you work no more than 15 hours a week this means you will get $25k/\xe2\x80\x8bannum. If you are part- time for more than 15 hours of work per week, you will get $35k/\xe2\x80\x8bannum (taxes not included).  </p><br><p>If you are full-time and work no more than 80 hours a week this is $58k/\xe2\x80\x8bannum, with taxes not included (so $50k/\xe2\x80\x8byear in tax-free income). If you are full-Time for more than 80 hours, you will get no more than $85k/\xe2\x80\x8bannum - we just don't have room for that many extra researchers. However:</p><br><ul>
<li>Even in that case, if you work as little as half of your potential your yearly pay will still be $100k/\xe2\x80\x8byear (tax-free).  Or, if you get a full-time position elsewhere, you could ask about a contract swap to make the same money working a shorter season for FHI (or more, if you would prefer).  </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We are very interested in hearing whether your future career plans will take you into academic research in some way, so that we can ensure the highest quality applications we can to support your career plans.</li>
</ul><br><p>We have very flexible hours\xe2\x80\x94we usually give people the option to work from home. </p><br><p>In addition to salary (which you pay when you start working, and which can end earlier if we move to a different payment plan with different numbers for tax-free and taxed incomes) we generally offer a number of benefits:</p><br><ul>
<li>In general, if you want funding at the start of the year, you should apply in January.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you want to apply in October to get funding from the end of the year, or if you want two pay bands with different numbers for first and second year funding, you can use the application below (there will generally be some delay).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>You can still use either application, but it may take more than 30 days to hear back once you hit submit - we will generally aim to get back to you within about 10 days of receiving your application.__</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We are willing to take on more applicants for a year if you apply during January.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Please do apply even if that sounds too long term, there is no fixed deadline. We may still take you on as a part- timer this year.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>We are not actively searching for part-time employees at the moment, so we will probably only take you even if you are planning to do it part-time, as long as you are in the final steps of the application process (making your final decision about us, and filling out the application form in the last week before the deadline).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>However, there is usually a queue of people with very similar skills to you, so we may not be able to take all applicants we could possibly take if we fill all of them.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If that's the case, just let us know, and we'll try to make another slot available (either for you, or for somebody else).</li>
</ul><br><p>What kinds of work can <strong>you</strong> do?</p><br><p>Your role as a FHI researcher will fall somewhere on a continuum between the following:</p><br><ul>
<li>Working full-time on top-end research, e.g. working on big, cutting-edge papers</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Working as a research assistant for one of the Research Directors</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>If you intend to do more of this kind of research in the future, e.g., if your ultimate goal is to be a top researcher, we may want to see a lot of your work to know how useful you will be.</li>
</ul><br><p>Most likely, you will do a mix of these.</p><br><p>Who can <strong>do</strong> this?</p><br><p>Anyone who can perform at least 80 hours of useful work per week will be a good fit, but we will be especially interested in people who: </p><br><ul>
<li>Have a background in maths or CS,</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are reasonably good at working in an academic context, and</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Are able to contribute to top-end research</li>
</ul><br><p>The work you will be doing is a mix of:</p><br><ul>
<li>Writing grant proposals, researching grant applications, editing papers, and similar (with the main requirement being a good English accent and conversational abilities). </li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Why is this a great __opportunity?</strong>:__</p><br><p>FHI would like to do cutting-edge research on long-term anthropogenic catastrophic risks, especially those that may arise from the development of strong AI. These risks could include things like advanced bioweapons, bioterrorism, and nuclear war. We want to ensure that humanity is prepared for these risks, so that we are less likely to suffer irreversible damage, and/\xe2\x80\x8bor that there are warning shots or other chance to avert a disaster.</p><br><p>For this purpose, it is vital that we identify which specific risks matter most, by gathering and studying as much scientific evidence as we can, and making good decisions (using a wide variety of methods) about which risks are more likely than others to become a potential problem in the future. We need someone who can help us think clearly and rationally about these topics, who can contribute to the literature in our area of interest, and who can make our decision process more rigorous by making us think carefully about the arguments and evidence.</p><br><p>What are the main obstacles in the way of working on these problems? The FHI website is a good starting point for finding out more about the problem landscape, but our researchers' main focus is generally on how to help humanity make decisions during and after a major extinction event that threatens humanity's long-term future. These problems also feature heavily in the news and the popular imagination, and the internet and academic literature abound with examples of people who wanted to stop them. However, due to the low level of awareness of these issues, the difficulty of setting standards of evidence and standards of impact, the enormous potential economic benefits of reducing these risks, and the dearth of funding for this kind of work, the biggest threats to humanity's long- term future are typically (but not always) caused from accidents rather than deliberate creation. Therefore, at the moment our biggest need is for people with a strong theoretical research background, who are able to think clearly about complex technical topics and make good decisions about what research is more helpful, what isn't. </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
