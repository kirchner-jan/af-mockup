So I thought it was a good example of one of my writing forms, and I'm offering it as an essay to be posted on LW. It's about the way we talk about science. It seems fairly typical and not important enough to deserve an article, but I remember some LW folk being annoyed at it and asking why I hadn't just written a review article, so here you go.]</em></p><br><p>It was a beautiful day today.</p><br><p>I woke up to the sun shining through my window, and my usual collection of emails and blogs to read.</p><br><p>And then I saw a link to a paper in a journal that I follow, published a couple of months back. And I saw it was by one of my coauthors\xe2\x80\x94a link on their homepage, a mention in our papers.</p><br><p>It made me think to myself, the problem with modern science is there aren't any good links on your homepage to remind you of when the things you find interesting have been found to be true.</p><br><p>I started by remembering my own journey into science. I was interested in evolutionary psychology because I liked a lot of people who do it professionally, and I like reading about human preferences because I like thinking about human preferences. So I tried to find out what evolutionary psychology was like, and sure enough, it's a thing where you start with a bunch of interesting-sounding evolutionary psychology ideas, or at least interesting-sounding _mis_taken evolutionary psychology ideas, and then show that the things you originally thought were so important turn out not to be important after all.</p><br><p>It took me about four tries to get all the way through a standard introductory evolutionary psychology book, because they start with a new set of fascinating ideas, which the author claims are so important that we shouldn't doubt them without a really compelling argument, which is why his essay is the book's first chapter. In four attempts, I learned a couple more interesting stuff about evolution, but it became annoying after a while, and I tried again with a different book, which was much less interesting and only seemed to talk about the things that everybody knows about all the time. Then I tried yet another book that started out completely useless. Then I thought "maybe it's about time to admit I'm a lazy scientist"</p><br><p>I did the same thing on my other blog, actually.</p><br><p>Then I found LessWrong and it was like a second chance in the evolution department. Here on LessWrong I can ask other scientists to spell me out which of their ideas are absolutely necessary. Here I can talk to someone who believes evolution is real, and is just asking for some new ideas. Here I can read science history and learn which great scientists agree with me. Here I can learn about how other scientists have been wrong. Here I can finally see for myself what a whole _group _of scientists think about a particular topic without getting the same "oh yeah, I'm a scientist" vibe that I feel when I'm reading the introductions of other books on the subject.</p><br><p>So now I have a sense of what scientists are thinking about, and the most important things they think are the history of past failures in our beliefs, the counterarguments those failures raised, how other scientists' views have changed, and the future likelihood of scientists reaching consensus on many issues.</p><br><p>Which is also the main reason I feel annoyed at anyone who just links to their own latest paper. We can all have our latest ideas, and I don't think it's any more important when the link is from one scientist linking to another than when it's from a journalist summarizing a paper in the Guardian. But when we <em>don't even know how to search for</em> our field's history, the latest papers are like manna from heaven compared to the rest of the literature. And if we <em>could</em> search \xe2\x80\x93 if every day we got sent links to other people claiming to have discovered a new truth \xe2\x80\x93 we'd probably have a very bad time.</p><br><p>So I get mad for people linking to work without a disclaimer, and I get even madder if they link to someone else quoting their own work without a disclaimer. But maybe I'm just being selfish because writing about this stuff is fun and lets me be more of a nerd than I usually am.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
