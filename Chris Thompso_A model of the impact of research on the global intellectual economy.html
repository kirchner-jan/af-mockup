</ul><br><p>__This post comes out of a conversation with Daniel Kokotajlo, in which we explored the question: what's going on with the intellectual economy? I'll start by explaining my view of the situation, since my starting point is that there's a lot of room for disagreement. Then, I'll sketch a model to try and explain what's going on, and why. Finally, I want to lay out the application of it and how this might inform the strategies of those who care about this space._</p><br><p>Background</p><br><ul>
<li>The world intellectual economy is worth a _trillion dollars</li>
</ul><br><p>I've been using the term "intellectual economy" a lot lately and think it's important to be very clear that I don't mean this just to talk about the economic value of research in AI. I want to be a bit more specific than that, and talk about the intellectual work that is done in various fields. The economic value of knowledge is just one piece in the puzzle that I want to help you understand.</p><br><ul>
<li>The intellectual work is done by a large population of human beings that is not easily categorised. The majority don't fall in any recognised research field, and may even not do any explicitly intellectual work</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The way we conceptualise "knowledge" has changed a lot in recent years, and in particular has moved away from being about ideas and towards being about inter- and multi-generational relationships.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There is no way to track intellectual work that isn't based on the subjective judgements of researchers. The objective value of knowledge relies on judgements of researchers, who don't necessarily have an obvious bias towards doing valuable work. This is the point "I am not a post-modern or a post-academicist or a post-modernist post-academic, etc.".</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Knowledge has become a kind of global commons, in which intellectual work can be done and consumed at will, from across different societies. The knowledge becomes available on the internet, and can spread virally.</li>
</ul><br><p>I think these points are worth flagging, because they are important to understand if you want to know what's going on in the overall structure of the intellectual economy. I'm using <em>intellectual work</em> broadly, to include things like making posts on LessWrong, reading and commenting on other blogs, tweeting stuff, making YouTube videos about whatever interests you. This is the kind of work that's mostly happening today, which we want to understand, in order to inform our thinking on how to shape knowledge flow in favour of humanity. That said, I want to point out that the "knowledge" that is being "produced" these days is mostly of low value\xe2\x80\x94unlike the industrial revolution that is often discussed in this space, it's mainly just a bunch of noise.</p><br><p>I'll be thinking a lot about how <em>knowledge production</em> is different from just information production. What is the right way to <em>conceptually</em> separate knowledge from other forms of intellectual work? That's where this post starts.</p><br><p>The framework</p><br><p>__Intellectual ____ works are things like blog posts, papers, code written, videos, images, websites, and so forth. They may or may not be shared outside their author's network, but they all need to be shared between users. They are used both by researchers and by non-researchers. They include, but it doesn't necessarily have to be, technical research output from journals.</p><br><p>__Producing __intellectual work is not the same as information production. They are produced differently. They are produced by a particular person or a small group of people, who know the constraints that are applied to them and can make creative use of them. They are judged differently. I'll say more about this later on.</p><br><p><strong>Insight</strong> appears when a user finds a new intellectual work and understands it so well that they can explain it, teach it, make new intellectual works to follow it, or make intellectual work that builds upon it. Their insight is the key component of intellectual work, but it is something that almost entirely happens behind the scenes. For example, suppose one thinks up a post on the basis of reading a blog post on the internet, but when they make the actual post, they come up with something new and insightful. In that case they've produced a new insight for the intellectual work\xe2\x80\x94even though no-one else had ever seen that insight, just them. On the other hand, suppose someone is really good at making posts or videos that are derivative of whatever intellectual work they're talking about, but for some weird reason the author has never read the intellectual work. Then, they just copy and paste the work without changing anything. This is not an insight, it's just a repeat of what has already been said.</p><br><p>Intellectual work <em>is</em>, however, the ultimate tool for the production of insight. So, insight is about how to use intellectual work to produce more insight. The model of the impact I'm looking at here consists of three big stages:</p><br><ul>
<li>Understanding an underlying framework of knowledge, such as what counts as a blog post, what counts as a research paper, what counts as scientific publishing, and what counts as a conversation.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Generating new intellectual work in that framework, with that understanding.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Re-generating insight by making connections to the existing work. If you discover that something has already been said, make something similar, and maybe add it to the existing collection of ideas. If you discover some new insight, then use it to inspire new intellectual work.</li>
</ul><br><p>And that's about it. All _intellectual _work is a means to the end of generating insight by providing a framework in which to make and compare new ideas.</p><br><p>The importance of knowledge</p><br><p>Imagine you are a scientist, and you have some great idea. Maybe your idea is for an AI agent to be able to identify when it's being used against its own interests and ignore that signal from then on. Maybe you believe that this will solve world hunger and improve the health of every single person on the planet. Maybe you believe some other crazy thing, but whatever it is, it gets you excited and you spend a long time researching, blogging and working on writing papers. All this work is building towards an insight about how to combine ideas into an agent that will help you achieve everything you want to achieve. What this means is that you are applying knowledge, but it's <em>not the kind of knowledge that most people imagine as their contribution to society</em>.</p><br><p>Most of the time when people think of knowledge, they think of things written down on paper (or maybe digital storage). But that doesn't help much if you don't understand it, and so we have these "knowledge economies", which involve knowledge being created and shared, and so forth, but without necessarily understanding it in any detail.</p><br><p>This kind of knowledge is <em>incredibly</em> important. If you spend eight months generating some blog posts, but then leave it at that, you're not likely to ever get your idea written up into a paper in a journal, and even if you did, chances are it's not going to be very likely to end up making a big scientific contribution to AI theory. The problem is not that there's something fundamentally different about knowledge produced from behind the scenes; the problem is that if you don't have access to that knowledge, it's not going give you a real chance of contributing. This is true for many fields of intellectual work. For example, writing a post on LessWrong that gets read by a hundred people gets you much more access to the knowledge contained in that post than someone who has just read it. It also allows your posts to be part of the conversation in a way that a book that never made it to the printing presses couldn't. In general I think that most people who aren't working in AI already have some kind of idea about some of the barriers they need to pass to contribute to global intellectual work, and I want to go into some of how I think about that.</p><br><p>The issue of intellectual work being done in labs\xe2\x80\x94in research universities, but also outside academia entirely\xe2\x80\x94seems to confuse many people. There's an old piece by Vernor Vinge asking why so much low-value work goes on in these places, and the top answer is "because that's where all the funding is. If you don't do it in a research university, nobody is going to fund you." I think this misses a lot of important nuance. Many times the people working in these places are not doing basic research, nor are they trying to produce things that are going to be published in journals. They may not be doing a kind of work that fits the concept of work that has previously received public funding. I think a better idea is that these institutions are places where intellectual work happens on every day a bit, but not in a way that is likely to lead to insight. These institutions are more like libraries than research labs, with the crucial difference being that you do not have to go to any of them to read or write the things being stored there.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
