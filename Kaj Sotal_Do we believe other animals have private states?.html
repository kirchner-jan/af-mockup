I started out by clarifying what I meant with an example. The example I used was that of a bank robber, who has only so much money, and can decide when he has reached his limit and decides to quit. "If your limits are being set by the number of dollars in your bank account," I explained, "then why shouldn't I have limits set by the number _of animals</em> in the world?" _</p><br><p>To be clear, this is just the kind of thing you could get used to in economics classes. "Banks are maximizing the number of dollars they make," I said, "so you shouldn't expect banks to be the only ones that ought to have limits on their budgets. Why should the state-banking authorities be the only ones? Why shouldn't we demand that some limits be set by the number animals, or the number plants, or any other kind of entity\xe2\x80\x94shouldn't we grant that, just like people might quit their jobs and choose to work for themselves instead, some entities might quit being entities? Shouldn't we see what goes well and what doesn't in the animal agriculture sector before deciding how things should be done there, instead of letting ourselves be limited by a moralistic sense of 'not doing it wrong'?"1</p><br><p>A couple of people started thinking it was a stupid question.</p><br><p>I continued to point out that it isn't the same thing as making money for yourself\xe2\x80\x94if you choose to earn money for yourself without a moral mandate from someone else, that's fine. Making money for yourself means that you can <em>afford</em> money. With animals, making money for yourself would mean <em>not</em> requiring that other entities should be doing a thing. No one would argue that a bank is <em>not</em> doing a thing, if the bank is operating for profit, and that the bank is the one that should be getting limits on how high a demand it can sustain. As far as anyone could tell, no one was making me moralistic demands on my decision-making process.</p><br><p>And yet somehow when we started talking about the use of animal products, the question of animal welfare kept coming up. People were making statements about how they eat meat, and the others disagreed. It was a strange and surprising turn of circumstances that made it important to me to figure out what was going on here.</p><br><p>To my surprise, none of those people who had started to discuss whether others should be having limits on their budgets seemed willing to hear that this was a reasonable thing for me to do about my own preferences. At some point one of them did suggest that I thought it was reasonable for me to not eat meat because of my preference to donate to effective charity. I was genuinely surprised at how little willingness there was to try to find a compromise where none of us had to change our preferences so much.</p><br><p>I think part of the problem was that it was difficult to figure out how to describe this without sounding like I was claiming that animals don't have private states in the way they do. After all, if you start talking about the idea of private states and why not? it's a pretty clear-cut case. An entity's private right is distinct from the state's right to manage the entity. In order to explain this to the others present, it would be necessary to explain what private states are, and where they come from. I think this was a good thing insofar as a solution to the animal welfare problem doesn't need the kind of clear arguments we usually use to try to explain why one should let oneself be in possession of a certain kind of private property. But now that we're talking about "private welfare", it's very hard to separate the animal welfare considerations themselves (is it unethical to use animals for food?) from the discussion of the underlying concept of "private state".</p><br><p>But I found another way of seeing the whole thing\xe2\x80\x94one which I'd already been using to describe how I think about the idea of "private preferences"\xe2\x80\x94that showed me where the animal welfare discussion had always been going wrong.</p><br><p>The thing I do, when I imagine the world in terms of people wanting to use other people as means to their own ends, is usually to imagine that the people involved want the same of everyone. When you imagine things this way, the whole question of private welfare, and moralistic demands, tends to dissolve into the question of "wouldn't the entity doing the demand themselves rather be maximizing the number of utility points they generate?"2</p><br><p>When you're trying to figure out where your limits might be, it doesn't make sense to assume that the entity you're interacting with wants to give you more than they themselves are already getting. I would want to see it as an obligation on the part of the entity that had more options than me, to at least accept a fair offer.</p><br><p>Now in the example above, a lot of people disagreed with this and were making arguments which amounted to insisting that, if you already had enough to live on, there was no reason for you to refuse animal products, since it was already something you did have the ability to do. But if we can assume that everyone agrees that no animal <em>ought</em> to be used for something they don't want to give up, then we find ourselves in the situation of looking at people that are already using other people, and saying "if only you were more conscious of their situation. If you had the same idea of a private state as we do now, you would probably feel exactly the same way that we do about people with less private welfare than we do."</p><br><p>So then you ask that person: "what if I think that using other entities for your ends is okay, but I think that <em>some</em> of the entities you might use do not benefit from the experience?"</p><br><p>And then what they might tell you is a variation on the argument against animal agriculture often seems to go something like this:</p><br><p>"Well, I like using money for things too. <em>How</em> could you argue, then, that being alive isn't a benefit? We both want to live! We both enjoy living and want to continue living! It really seems like we should just <em>agree</em> on this! To think that the animals are being harmed when I enjoy using them is something that just isn't true!"3</p><br><p>I think a lot of this kind of argument actually gets pretty far past the question of whether people have private welfare states. I think it's pretty clear that the argument has missed the point of what welfare we're talking about in the first place\xe2\x80\x94we're talking about people having states. It's not whether an entity has a private state or not, it's whether it's doing something different from what they would choose for themselves. When it comes to welfare comparisons, animals should probably be compared to <em>other people</em> not <em>other processes</em>.</p><br><p>1 At first, I thought I would write a post that argued for why animal welfare isn't a good thing. I still think that's a good idea, but I don't think it's the most important thing, anymore. If you want people to respect animals, the key to respect is probably convincing other people to give animals themselves more moral weight. You could try to use animal welfare as an argument against eating meat, for example, but if other people are already aware of this, then you'd be missing half the point. And just because someone isn't trying to use the argument doesn't make the argument invalid\xe2\x80\x94you have to look at the actual consequences of <em>your</em> preferences in order to be sure that they're actually in line with what you <em>actually</em> want.</p><br><p>2 See "Why you should expect (some) moral demands to be satisfied by a preference utilitarian" for a full discussion of this point.</p><br><p>3 I've heard this one a couple of times.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
