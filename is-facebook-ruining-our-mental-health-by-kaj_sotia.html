I don't spend hours reading Facebook and I usually delete all news-type sites once I have read them. (I enjoy the comments on the Facebook posts and in fact am often amazed by how much I can learn about many topics through the comments.) Additionally, I rarely ever go on a Facebook binge, spending, say, 50 hours each in a day on Facebook, and so it can't plausibly cause me to be so time-consuming with Facebook.</p><br><p>Furthermore, even if this is true, perhaps this isn't too relevant for society as a whole. Consider that in the article by the Washington Post they write:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>It has been shown time over time that the most addictive sites on the Internet, including Facebook, have little if any effect on depression, anxiety or self-esteem, and that more frequent visits to these sites do not even lead to increases in depression symptoms.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>We could imagine the opposite scenario, where it is in fact Facebook that causes these problems, but the benefits of spending more time on Facebook are so great that most people end up spending too much time on Facebook. In this scenario, the problem would be even more common, maybe so common that they wouldn't even be able to measure it in terms of number of users and average time spent on Facebook.</p><br><p>I also don't find that the claim that our society is plagued by an increase in depression to be surprising in itself. We already all know that depression is really common, that it affects many people (even if they don't know it). The depression rate is high enough that society is willing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars per year on treatments for depression. This sort of makes me think it's probably not that hard to come up with a really good reason why our society would be plagued by an increase of depression. It's just that I haven't heard of many reasons.</p><br><p>To me, a plausible reason is that the increased level of depression is largely caused by other factors besides Facebook. For example, society in general was becoming more isolated, less connected, more atomized, and so on, and the internet facilitated a spread of these factors which is causing us to become even more depressed (if Facebook weren't there, we'd need to invent some other way to be depressed). I don't find this theory plausible, however, because I don't think Facebook, despite its very addictive nature, actually contributed to the increased isolation.</p><br><p>Furthermore (and in this context also the Washington Post article), I think that for a lot of time now we have been exposed to so much depressing news that we have lost the ability to recover from it after a day or week at a time, but we aren't very good if we just block the news. I'd love to know whether or not this is true!</p><br><p>The article also links to this survey that says that only 8% of respondents (about 15% of the US population) "feel that Facebook has had a negative impact on their mental health", which is really surprising to me since, again, I myself have never thought that Facebook had ever been an issue for me. It's also important to note that the survey doesn't say "negatively impact your mental health", but rather "impact your mental health".</p><br><p>I'm pretty skeptical of this, however, and I've never had an issue with Facebook. I have, however, had some issues with my emotions, both on Facebook and offline. But my symptoms were very minor and didn't last that long; they didn't cause me to stay on Facebook more often, but simply caused me to have some problems.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
