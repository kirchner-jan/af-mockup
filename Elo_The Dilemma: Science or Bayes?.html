You are going through the hall way to the library. There it is. Science and Bayes.</p><br><p>Science\xe2\x80\x94the thing that says _the stars, water and life arose from a long time of the same processes that have led to their present arrangement. _The same process that has allowed us to build computers.</p><br><p>Scientific claims. Claims that are designed to be wrong. Claims that are very specific. For example, 'the earth orbits the sun'. That is, of course, correct. The claim is a lie. A lie. The stars, water and earth didn't form from a long period of same processes. They form from a period. They form from billions of years in the past.</p><br><p>Science says that the sun doesn't go around the earth. Science says that the distance from earth to sun is a million times the earth to moon distance. Science says that our position within our galaxy is not as large as it is. Because we are looking elsewhere, when we look around the earth to the moon, we see the moon as our own self because we can move our eyes all that distance and call that the moon, as it is far away from us.</p><br><p>Science is very, very good at getting the right answer, but as you know, science can get things wrong as well. Science gets these matters wrong because it can't know the future. There is a future. There is the way that things will be if those claims are not true. They will be less.</p><br><p>And the future matters.</p><br><p>And science does not know the future. And scientists know that too.</p><br><p>Bayes \xe2\x80\x93 the thing that looks at data and says, <em>the amount of data</em>. The degree to which it would change your beliefs. Or something. I don't know. And then you know that it has looked at some data and made a prediction. You know that it has done something because it has an answer. You know that the data was in a form and that it had been in and out of your consciousness. You know that you could use that answer as the answer to another question and so on. That's what having an answer means. Science and Bayesianism both have this thing. Because both have an answer. Science with a single definite answer and Bayesianism with a degree of certainty or probability.</p><br><p>Science and Bayes agree on how to use the data. They just do it differently. A person could not tell the difference between Science and Bayes if they saw it all the time. But if you knew the difference it could tell you something about the world or the person you are trying to convince or the answer to a big question or even more. </p><br><p>Which is why I sometimes say that Bayes and science seem to be in a dilemma and science is the answer and Bayes is a way, but they are not the answer and neither is the end (yet \xe2\x80\x93 or maybe not ever. I only know the beginning).</p><br><p>Science and bayes are in many ways opposite things. They have their place and role. It seems to me that science is much more useful than many people think. It's all very well and good (and important) that science is wrong when it comes to certain topics. But the more you learn of various things, the less wrong science is. And you just have to remember that it's probably not going anywhere. And that it's not always going to get what it wants.</p><br><p>But bayes has a place too. It's interesting as a thing to know where if you can remember about the role of it. It's an important thing to know how to use Bayes. But it's also an interesting thing to know that it doesn't go with all the other facts. It's a big part of the whole puzzle. </p><br><p>So science and Bayes. I like them both, and I need them both.</p><br><p>But also I like the idea of knowing science and Bayes separately.</p><br><p>Or I do I suppose. I have not tried to separate in this post. I'm trying to show the dilemmas for anyone who might want to know them. I'll try and write a bit more about the dilemmas later, when I have time to write an actual post.</p><br><p>I think it's also an issue of having a way of learning about things, being taught about things. You know the rules of Bayes and Science. You already know that the answer is in this list and this table. You already know something.</p><br><p>You know that the data has gone through many pairs of eyes (for science) and an algorithm (for Bayes). And so you know something. You have an answer.</p><br><p>And you know more than that. You know about science not being right. You know about Bayes not being right. Which is fine, but how did you learn about science and Bayes being wrong? And how did you learn that?</p><br><p>If you know science then you will know that science won't always be in the right. In this case (and the data is not as reliable as in the past, but is still much better than anything I've ever seen) it was wrong. And what if you know Bayes? Or Science? Do you know a way of using Bayes to get away with saying science is not always right? Or do you know enough about Bayes that you know how he got away with putting an answer to this question?  </p><br><p>It's also very interesting trying to find out what a science and a bayesian could get apart on. A theory vs a fact, a model vs fact (that model is based on facts). These seem to be two of the things they could get apart on most frequently.</p><br><p>How could you separate them? What might it look like to be able to do that? What would that mean? It's not a trick question.</p><br><p>This is a problem not so much of knowing which science is wrong, but knowing the difference between things being true and things being in any way known to be wrong.</p><br><p>But it's an essential problem. You need some way to know when you need the answer, and when you don't. You need a way of telling which people have found ways of using science (or Bayes or something else) to get away with making these kinds of claims. And you need to know which claims they have and which claims they've made you believe.</p><br><p>If you can't tell the difference it will be bad for you (a lot of people actually do say they know, so you need to know what they mean).</p><br><p>If you are going to use these methods yourself, it needs to be as well, or you probably won't be able to tell the difference. The best way to tell if someone has found a way is a way of knowing if someone has found ways. If you can't tell, you can't trust the method. If you can tell, you can trust it or not. </p><br><p>The other thing that can make it really hard, is being told by someone how to do something but not what they are getting at. And that's the worst thing you could ever have to go through. If I told you that x is true then y is true then x is probably not true. Or if someone thinks that a model can be a fact, while saying that a model is more like a belief than a fact. (or a belief of what a model is).</p><br><p>I will try and say some more about science and Bayesianism in the future, when I have some time to say that one thing rather than another.</p><br><p>But we need to put these things in context, because someone (suddenly reminded of why a post called'science vs Bayes' was written) could be looking at someone and saying, "have you tried science? Do you know about science?"</p><br><p>And that's why I need to add a bit more context when I talk about science and bayes. Because people could be misunderstanding something, or could misunderstand what you can or can't do with them, so the things I say about Science and Bayes, are not about knowing which is right (although that is still often interesting if you are interested in the process and the debate that goes on when it all happens so far away and you can't have access to any of the participants or their arguments).</p><br><p>I'm also thinking about how it might be possible to be so confused and not be able to see the ways that someone is doing science, while still using what they thought was science when you were confused. Or to use what they thought was bayes and be confused about what that was.</p><br><p>And so I think science and bayes could be in a dilemma of sorts.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
