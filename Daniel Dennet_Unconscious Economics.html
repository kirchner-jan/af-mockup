If you don't know about the Singularity, these two statements should go together like peanut butter and jelly on toast. And yet, AI is everywhere in our lives in one way or another. And yet, in our best estimation we still can't figure out how the heck "intelligence" comes about.</p><br><p>But while we're asking whether or not such a thing as "a dangerous AI" ever existed, why not ask whether or not something as obvious as human civilization ever came about in the first place? As far as we know, our species had a head start on the competition for food and land but we didn't invent farming or cooking or writing or any other of the technologies or "artifacts" of the agricultural revolution. As far as we can tell, a couple of hundred thousand years after our ancestors had already adapted to a hunter-gather diet, our cousins made a choice along the same lines and invented a completely different kind of culture. And this time they invented agricultural life, and their descendants now control literally billions of square miles of land and feed a global population of billions of people.</p><br><p>And yet, it takes a few billion years at the bare minimum for the process of natural selection to produce hominids capable of inventing nuclear or biotech. Surely, by the same token, the slow, arduous process of natural selection doesn't even begin to suggest the possibility of our species? How much further "from the meanest chimpanzee" have our culture managed to get by now? This question remains unanswered, not only because it's so obvious no one dares challenge it, but because we have absolutely no idea how to answer it.</p><br><p>"Human intelligence" is such a strange concept to apply to people who were, themselves, a long time ago but that is nonetheless not now. People would not have been much worried about "the rise of the machines" if those machines were still only chimpanzees. If, by the same reasoning, our culture must be vastly better than every other cultural adaptation available to our species, why do we still know so little, and why has no one dared to even approach the topic of why we have a head start on other species at all?</p><br><p>What could there have been to the vast economic gap between us and the chimpanzees? How, in this environment, could a culture of such radically different form and function ever come into being? This question, again, is not only very obvious, but still remains almost completely unanswered: no one has ever thought of it.</p><br><p>And so the mystery is not how anything at all comes by, it's why nothing at all comes by.</p><br><p>An easy way to answer these questions is to think about how our own minds work, and how they seem so much more advanced than those of our ancestors. It is obvious to anyone who thinks about it that the difference in these minds is far beyond our imaginations. But why has no one attempted to explain that, and why did we not notice the gap that once existed between us and chimpanzees?</p><br><p>The obvious way to explain that is that our brains are so much more efficient, or maybe "more human" are the things we're most sensitive to. But this explanation is not very satisfying, as it explains nothing\xe2\x80\x94but then again, neither is trying to explain the fact that our minds can process and understand things so much faster/\xe2\x80\x8bfaster/\xe2\x80\x8bfaster than those of our hominid cousins.</p><br><p>The most promising possible answer to both of these problems is to ask how much more efficient our brains are than chimpanzee brains, but we know almost nothing whatsoever about the efficiency of our brains, and there is no way to experimentally verify their efficiency or otherwise test the idea before testing it with our other ideas. There is no way to tell by testing which ideas work and which ones won't, whether our brains are more evolved than they would look otherwise or whether they work at all. There are some ideas out there, like the idea of brain emulations and how much more efficient they'd be than unaugmented humans, that would be very interesting to test, but none of the ideas that would be most valuable to actually test have received much thought put into them, and that's a shame. In the process of testing the efficiency or evolution of our intellect we are most likely to get valuable information that would allow us to actually answer questions like how much more efficient (or evolved) our brains are than those of our cousins. That, too, would prove an interesting experiment once we came to actually know enough about our brains to run it.</p><br><p>Until then\xe2\x80\x94so far as we can see\xe2\x80\x94the question of the efficiency of our intellect and our brains in general is one of the great missing puzzle-pieces of evolutionary biology and the nature of intelligence and the future of our species, and we still have almost zero idea whatsoever about what's been going on all this time that has led to the incredible differences we see between our brains and those of our homologous species, much less how it got started in the first place.</p><br><p>The best we can do is to call it "the Great Intelligence Test"\xe2\x80\x94the question of how much more/\xe2\x80\x8bless/\xe2\x80\x8bdifferent our intellect and brains are from what we would expect from a theory of natural selection on our brains, to see if there is some aspect of those brains that makes us so unique from our cousins. Afterward, if the tests show one aspect of the question is false, it can go in another category, but not before.</p><br><p>It might be a problem with the way this question is written, but I think a better way to begin is to replace the question with this one: What test for our intelligence and brains should we run, given the information we already have? To answer that question, I'd also like to talk a bit about the kind of data that the tests would ideally have.</p><br><p>We can start by looking at the brain as a whole, but in a case like this there seems little reason to limit ourselves to the brain. There are all kinds of things that would count as a better explanation, but the whole point of this exercise is to see if we can find anything about our brains that would actually provide such an explanation. The data that is needed for the test is all the information that would actually tell us about our brains, including all the information we've gleaned about them by other sources; not just all the information coming out of the brain. Only information coming from our brains is relevant for the question. If we don't know how we know, then we don't know anything coming from the tests.</p><br><p>It is also important to note here that just because someone may know some things about their own brains, that doesn't mean they can tell us anything about other brains. As we've just seen with our comparison between human brains and chimpanzee brains, there's a big gap between the two. If the answer to the problem is to simply increase the amount of data that our intelligence tests should use to compare the two, then we need either to run lots and lots of tests on our brains or on other parts of the brain that differ from ours in some way. The problem doesn't seem solvable until we find some other way to actually test the question of differences in cognitive styles between our brains and chimpanzee's brains or between other brains and the hominids they've evolved from.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
