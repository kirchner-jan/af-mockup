Their lab was located in a university far away from any political departments, and it operated in secret.</p><br><p>The problem was that they lacked equipment. In particular, they lacked a mass spectrometer, and without the ability to detect the presence of small particles, nothing in their work could be published or even shared with other researchers. Moreover, the university where they worked didn't have any way to buy or borrow one. No professor in the university was willing to steal and use it for his own interest.</p><br><p>However, if a university student was in possession of a mass spectrometric instrument, everything they needed for their research would be handed over. Furthermore, a researcher inside the university could always use the instrument to check whether anyone else's work was trying to steal the same instrument. At the very least, there would be a very real chance for theft to be caught.</p><br><p>(I believe that this is basically the same situation, but hopefully readers see what I intended by replacing the word "scientist" with the word "politican".)</p><br><p>So, the two scientists decided to contact the university security. But the security guards were uninterested in listening to the scientists. In other words, while there was a clear risk that they'd be accused of stealing the instrument, they didn't consider this worthy of immediate concern. In fact, such actions were part of the normal functioning of a civil society; the chance of being accused of such actions was very small. For some reason, most people did care about the actions of others as soon as some significant fraction of them could benefit.</p><br><p>So the scientists went to the security guard and made the same pitch. The security guard didn't react to this. The pitch wasn't good enough. Finally, they decided for the sake of the scientists what they couldn't for their own interest. The police was notified about the missing instrument, and several officers from the police were assigned to investigate the situation.</p><br><p>However, the police was too slow. They had no legal ability to do anything about the scientists and, as things turned out, they were completely useless at detecting and dealing with stolen items. And anyway, the scientists had no intention of sharing their work until it's published. Thus, the case was closed, and the police left.</p><br><p>But one day, a few weeks later, a detective was going to visit the lab, and had a visit from the university security at the same time. This guy was different. During the first visit, they were polite throughout, and the second visit was very different. The guard seemed friendly and polite, and asked about the scientists. The guy told a story of his trip to the university and the visit to the security officer, along with some questions about the two scientists. But the conversation did not go very far. When asked whether the scientists had stolen the instrument, he said no. They hadn't. That was the end of it.</p><br><p>The next day, police raided the physicists' house. All five of them had to spend several days in jail, where they awaited trial. Later, they were placed under a permanent guard at home.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, none of the other scientists found out about the situation. It would have been better if they had. Fortunately, the local police is strong enough to keep an eye out on its citizens. It seems that most people who left the village were from the university, and so, most were able to talk about their experience to the police.</p><br><p>Eventually, the police found out. They told the university security officer that the scientists have violated university regulations, and are required to do the time for the sake of deterrence. However, since the scientists have not broken any laws, it is not clear what exactly they were supposed to be punished for. So the scientists have been released from the custody.</p><br><p>Eventually, some time after, police found out exactly what the scientists were doing and why. The scientist at the center of the case, one of the primary contributors of this research, was forced to leave the university, pending an investigation into the work he did.</p><br><p>I personally doubt the veracity of the story. But I hope it at least illustrates how, in our current state of affairs, scientists are often punished and persecuted for doing research that is not only morally objectionable, but also does not contribute anything to society. I also hope that the story illustrates the value of scientists being able to publish their work. It is important that scientists are able to talk to each other, especially about how things are going, even if they don't want to publish a paper at the moment. Such communication reduces the chance of conflict, and, if conflict does occur, the level of conflict.</p><br><p>As I've also been told that, in most cases, a scientist is fired when he refuses to share his work in an open-access journal. This leads to some bad incentives in academia, but the problem is not that important. It is important not to punish a scientist who refuses to publish something unethical. The problem is that when ethics come into conflict with politics, there usually isn't enough time for the ethics to win.</p><br><p>And that would be a problem if you were in a government position or something like that, where the ethics have to win. But ethical decisions always have plenty time. There are no dictators who want to oppress their citizens forever. There are no monarchs who want the same.</p><br><p>I'm not saying that we should not have any ethics at all in government. I'm even having a certain amount of fun with the thought. Rather I'm just pointing out a certain conflict of interests. I don't have any specific idea how to resolve this conflict, but, if I ever found myself in a position of power, it wouldn't take much effort to find out how to resolve it. That's if I can find the time to think about it. And that's if I haven't been replaced from my current position.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
