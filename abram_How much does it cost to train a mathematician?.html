<li>What it does</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>My impression</li>
</ul><br><p>For the last year or so, I've been building some models about the nature of intelligence. I recently posted a sequence about my models, but since then I've thought about it a bit more, and decided to try to estimate some of these things with numbers.</p><br><p>I'm making a lot of guesses here, some of which are highly subjective. I'd welcome any additional research into these subjects, and am especially interested in feedback on my beliefs on the questions themselves.</p><br><p>What it actually is and I'm not considering IRL, IDA, or debate</p><br><p>These kinds of models are meant to explain why we're not just seeing really impressive results on AI research, and to explain why we would expect AI/\xe2\x80\x8bML to work. I'd describe it as trying to explain naturalization, and how most people who have good ideas about intelligence just aren't smart enough to come up with them yet.</p><br><p>As far as I'm concerned, however, it's not doing this\xe2\x80\x94if you're doing something like this, I would describe the goal as figuring out how humans "could've" been. I'm sure there's some ways to make it make sense (as in I could've been a Mathematician, and you should treat my opinions about math as relevant), but the reason we <em>don't</em> is because we don't think math was like that.</p><br><p>How to distinguish the answers, exactly?</p><br><p>I'll use mathematical ability as a heuristic. This might not make sense right now, because most people don't think math ability is important for intelligence, or because they don't understand it, but the point is merely that I'm using heuristics wherever possible.</p><br><ul>
<li>When I'm speaking colloquially and as a rough heuristic, "mathematical ability" refers roughly to math ability, which is different from intelligence. Mathematical ability is, in many cases, very different from intelligence in many different ways\xe2\x80\x94it's not about the stuff you can do that's relevant to intelligence, it's about how you thought in the first place.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> If one can develop <em>better</em> math ability (as is distinct from smarter, which probably leads to better training methods being available), then one can be expected to gain more value from the training process.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Ability:</strong> Someone has ability X if they can do things they can't. This is defined both in the sense of having particular skills, but it's also in the more general sense of being able to perform in novel situations that they're not familiar with. Someone may have a better education than others, but not have the same ability to apply the skills they've learned, because they aren't thinking in the same way.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Someone with a particular ability (e.g. math + physics), and training the ability (e. g. going to an excellent college), will generally be better off than someone without the ability (e g. living in an average school and trying to get a "good job"), since many jobs that require high ability are very lucrative. This may not be the case for other skills. You could also be better or worse off than the median person at a particular job, but in that case it's not relevant that you have this ability in a particular field.</li>
</ul><br><p>A second definition, that I'm not sure to the degree to which is useful, is that people "with more mathematical ability" should be able to do more "useful math". However, a student who can do more difficult problems and write more difficult papers at the same quality will have more'math' ability.</p><br><p>So when I say 'people with more mathematical ability', I'm really interested in people with an ability to do more math, without training, without a large increase in their ability to do other skills, etc... I'm looking for the ability to write research papers and do math problems.</p><br><p>What if their ability to do math doesn't increase or is much lower than it could be? In that case, this ability can have _much more _of an impact on outcomes.</p><br><p>Cost</p><br><p>How much does it cost for people to produce such "artificial human mathematicians"? It seems like there are many factors that make this a tricky question to answer with models\xe2\x80\x94such as the cost of training, or the effectiveness of the training, or the cost of hiring or recruiting such a mathematician, etc... But there does seem to be evidence that, on average, the most effective ways of going about developing mathematical ability are the most expensive! (or that people who are trying to do similar research tend to go to the same schools\xe2\x80\x94although some of this may come down to the fact that those institutions have better quality of life.)</p><br><p>Another confusing thing, at least in my mind, is how intelligence and rationality are separated. I often run into people who have amazing insights into how to <em>improve</em> their abilities, and people who have wonderful understanding of psychology and how humans act in novel situations. I tend to find the ability to improve one's reasoning to be much less correlated with math ability than people imagine\xe2\x80\x94and to the degree that you "have high math ability", it seems that some innate ability must lead to better techniques, and hence probably higher math ability. I can be a decent mathematician without knowing how to <em>actually produce</em> the insights into human psychology required to get really good at math (since I generally need to study math first, and math doesn't lead anywhere with regards to making progress at "being good at math" per se). The only <em>direct</em> connection I've seen is that if someone has innate math ability, and good math, they may well have a bias that helps them learn more easily (although even then I have seen people with worse math skills learning math more effectively, when they're working on their own).</p><br><p>As mentioned, I'm making lots of guesses, and am mainly interested in feedback/\xe2\x80\x8bquestions on what I wrote (including specific numerical estimates for the things there and some ideas that weren't explicitly mentioned).</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>__What it does: __Mathematical ability in humans seems to be largely responsible for the fact that we're able to do math. A natural extrapolation from that seems to be that if you could actually train a mathematical AI, it would be possible to train it for similar reasons.</p><br><p>In many cases, I'd also expect the training method for this to have a cost that is proportional to the effort someone put into working on it, just as the cost is proportional to the training time that you take for the other skills (whether because you prefer them or they're useful in other contexts). Since a large amount of effort goes into studying math in college, I could be especially interested in how the time you spent studying math during college affects intelligence.</p><br><p>I think in most cases, there are going to be other effects that make this a complicated question to answer. Here's one example (although I don't know for certain): if you're training an AI to do math, it's much easier for it to study math if it's already been trained to do math (and the more math an AI has <em>already</em> studied, the easier it will be for it to learn more\xe2\x80\x94both from a general learning perspective, and since it will actually be used frequently for studying math by itself). If you were to train a mathematician out of a pool of candidates, I think that you'd be more likely to get people with lots of math ability than a pool of non-math people, so math ability seems more likely to explain people who did well in math, particularly in high school. (This effect would also be particularly large if most of the people you hired were the same age, so that the pool of math/\xe2\x80\x8bmath aware people was larger.) Note that I'm unsure about <em>all</em> these claims, and could easily be missing important considerations\xe2\x80\x94if I get more information I'm interested in that. This would also be a reason to not expect mathematical ability to be highly correlated with other abilities, even if they're highly intercorrelated, since many such abilities aren't going to be involved (and may affect intelligence in other ways).</p><br><p>Here's another example where I think it's a big question\xe2\x80\x94whether more math ability means better at the sorts of tasks that people do "after math", or simply being able to do better math. It seems that there are many different aspects of "mathematical skill" that may contribute, and in some cases more math ability just means better knowledge and more aptitude (which would make it more useful for being able to study math "after math"). I'm not <em>quite</em> sure whether that's the case\xe2\x80\x94but it seems that many of the aspects you care about here would have to be the case to make this question sensible.</p><br><p>Finally, there's the fact that the <em>quality of their math ability will depend a lot on how they're studying math</em>. There do exist many very great people who have learned math a lot by self studying, but if the quality of the way they learn is even a little bit lower, it could be a significant question as to what impact their study habits will have on their ability.</p><br><p>These considerations all seem difficult to disentangle, and hard to analyze. I'm really just trying to point them out, though the question still seems important. You might imagine that for a more "objective" estimate we might not need to make anything as subjective as this...</p><br><p>What it doesn't explain: where are the smart students who didn't study math in college?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
