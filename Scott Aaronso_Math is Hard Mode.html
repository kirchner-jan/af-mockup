<p>What I was doing when I wrote Infinite Jest can best be described in three words: I was working on something I was calling literary genius, but what I was getting at with it was to be the hero's journey of myself, who could do things that other people who were like myself couldn't do, and who was not just as good as any other writer but might be <em>the best writer ever</em>.</p>

</ul><br><p><em>The rest of a post can be found on Aaronson's Blog.</em></p><br><p>I.</p><br><p>I recently had a conversation with Abram Demski about the claim that "theoretical computer scientists can't appreciate that other people can do things they can't do, because all they can do is try." Abram's view is that this is a problem with intelligence in general, whether or not it's limited to theoretical computer scientists. However, I don't exactly share this view.</p><br><p>Let's unpack this claim a bit, and see if we can derive it from the math. First, suppose that the claim were false and that there was no such bias. Then, there's an obvious explanation: a smallish fraction of theoretical computer scientists have an unusual sort of intelligence which allows them do things they can never do. This would explain the empirical observations cited earlier: computer science majors in general don't perform better than other majors in math. Indeed, one might have expected there to be <em>no</em> relevant correlation; the claim that they perform worse in math would be a coincidence. Or maybe this is one of those cases where one should trust the data over an intuitive analysis?</p><br><p>But in general, computer science majors <em>are</em> much more successful than expected. This suggests a different explanation: it's just <em>harder</em> to do the things theoretical computer scientists do. One reason may be that they are more likely to be smart, but some of it must surely be from being smart in <em>different ways</em>.</p><br><p>Note that <em>if you can explain success using intelligence and talent, you explain less than is required</em>; and "more difficult" is all we're left with anyway.</p><br><p>I'm not going to present a <em>complete</em> argument here, since Abram is also intelligent and can see why I'm trying to get away with it, but we can make progress.</p><br><p>First, assume that intelligence doesn't give you more than 1/\xe2\x80\x8b4 as much money as talent, since the average economist is smarter than the average scientist. Then, from the standpoint of a theoretical computer scientist, the main thing missing in their environment is <em>talent</em>. Let's also assume that a theoretical computer scientist's environment does not contain other people who are smarter than them and therefore can out-perform them in some non-cognitive skills. The resulting problem statement seems solvable: given the hypothesis that the environment does not contain people who are smarter\xe2\x80\x94e.g. they may be equally talented, but they may be much dumber than they need to be \xe2\x80\x94 there is no prediction that computer science majors or theoretical computer scientists will win more money than non-computer science or non-theoretical computer science majors, or than the average person in their world.</p><br><p>Is this at all compatible with the data?</p><br><p>Not, and not just because of one anecdote cited earlier.</p><br><p>Example</p><br><p>Why would the data above be compatible with the hypothesis that the theoretical computer science majors in the sample didn't earn more money, if the underlying causal model behind the data was one in which the reason why a theoretical computer science major earned more money was that they were better at programming than the average <em>person who went to college?</em></p><br><p>Well, if they were better engineers, then the software industry may be a better place to work, and a theoretical computer science department may be such a place. If they were smarter, then one would expect them to have better ideas, and would listen carefully to those ideas. Etc. If a theory <em>is</em> able to predict that something is true, then there must either be some mechanism which makes more people believe that thing or to have such beliefs (i.e. belief in belief) than the general public does.</p><br><p>The first category of explanations are easily testable: how many theoretical computer scientists become software engineers? It sounds like you might test whether the people who became software engineers are smarter than the people who didn't, and so this can be an attempt to falsify the hypothesis.</p><br><p>The second category is the "real" category, and it seems to be the case. Here's another anecdote: I ran into a problem of this sort in another context. I was a student in university when I went on a study group to some other student's adviser, since he had an undergraduate degree in physics and could probably solve some computer science problems that were too hard for a mere theoretical computer scientist. The group didn't have anything in mind; the purpose of the discussion was to allow the two of us to bond with each other as human beings who understood each other well.</p><br><p>It quickly became clear that the adviser had the idea that he knew a lot more than we did about various computer science problems, but he couldn't understand anything about mathematical research, and was probably too dumb to understand anything. The problem was clear: theoretical computer scientists and theoretical physicists can't understand the sort of work that most theoretical computer scientists do, and they also can't understand each other well enough to form accurate estimates of how smart they are and how different they can communicate.</p><br><p>Thus, there's no contradiction in theoretical computer scientists being better at understanding what work other theoretical computer scientists do by knowing more about it. There are still going to be differences in <em>that</em> kind of intelligence between theoretical computer scientists and other people.</p><br><p>Of course, this is an entirely natural phenomenon from the perspective of theoretical computer science, which is, by definition, math hard mode. People in math hard mode aren't very good at explaining what they do, or even getting other people to do what they do. They have to rely on their instincts and an intuitive sense about what other people are capable of doing. But then why is the "talent gap" between theoretical computer scientists in software engineering so large? One wonders.</p><br><p>A story</p><br><p>Well, how did this come about? I offer this story. Let me know if you disagree (though, of course, I'm not claiming that it's true).</p><br><p>In math hard mode, and in theory in general, there's a sense of "if the people I know think X, doesn't that mean X is true? Or maybe, I think X is false but then I look at Y, doesn't that count as evidence that Y is true? Oh, and Y might turn out to be true, I should test it then." The "this person's work is useless" instinct is probably one of the most common human instincts.</p><br><p>So, as a result of knowing how easy it is to say "X is easy because X is true" when X is true, and how hard it is to say the same thing when X is false, and in general being bad at explaining what you do and getting your work to be useful by any means, including looking for other people who have the sort of skills that are good by the standards of your specialty and then saying "Here's how they do it, maybe you can copy their work"?</p><br><p>Well, there's a whole bunch of other specialties where theoretical computer science works on theoretical computer science problems, and theoretical physics works on theoretical physics problems, and theoretical biology works on theoretical biology problems, etc. And there's no real reason for these specialties to be "hard mode", because <em>if</em> a field doesn't work on its "own thing", someone has to be a theoretical biologist in order to work on theoretical biology problems; there's no problem with that.</p><br><p>So what happens to theoretical computer science? Well, most people who work closely with theoretical computer scientists do other theoretical things, and the people who are trying to make their work useful with their other theoretical skills know that theoretical computer science is hard mode relative to other theoretical domains, and so are quite surprised when they see someone like Bob Alon do something theoretical computer scientists can't.</p><br><p>For that reason, there's no reason to think that theoretical computer science problems aren't just-as-important in the real world as theoretical physics problems or theoretical biological problems.</p><br><p>For a story this brief, it might not sound quite <em>sufficient</em>, but let me try to be less vague. If there are some mathematical problems which are hard to solve because they require skills which don't exist in most other disciplines that use the same language, and if <em>they</em> are just as important, then if you're a computational scientist one of the first things you should try to acquire are those skills. Or, more generally, if there are lots of important problems in math/\xe2\x80\x8bcompsci which would be very useful for you to be familiar with even if you never <em>do</em> anything with them directly, then you're probably missing out on a major resource in an important domain.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
