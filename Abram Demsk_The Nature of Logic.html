Not sure how much it will translate to the more general version.</em></p><br><p>I recently had occasion to look upon the difference between modal logic (the formal version of intuitionistic logic) and classical logic. I noticed that there are some pretty weird differences between the two. This fact in itself is not that surprising, but I was really surprised when I considered what would happen if instead of two different formal systems, we used modal logic as one system and classical logic as a second system.</p><br><p>Consider these two axioms that can be put in a modal axiomatization of classical logic:</p><br><ul>
<li>\xce\x93=\xe2\x96\xa1(\xce\x93) is sound (it follows from the axioms that \xce\x93 is consistent with classical logic).</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>\xce\x93\xe2\x8a\xa2\xce\xa6\xe2\x86\x92\xce\xa6 is sound (it is an axiom of classical logic).</li>
</ul><br><p>Notice that the second premise in the above inference rule follows automatically from the soundness of the inference rule if we take \xce\x93 as the modal formula \xce\xa6. However, it is logically <em>not</em> sound for \xce\x93=\xe2\x96\xa0  (a formula in modal logic which encodes "this formula is provable in Peano Arithmetic") in classical logic.</p><br><p>So, what happens if we take two different systems, and plug them into the same inference rule? There's an interesting result: the conclusions that can be generated by the premises using one of the two systems are <em>not</em> the same conclusions that are generated using the other system.</p><br><p>So, as an inference rule, modal logic cannot assume that Peano Arithmetic can prove all mathematical statements (that is, PA can prove all G\xc3\xb6del sentences). But this doesn't mean that \xce\x93\xe2\x86\x94\xce\xa6 is <em>not</em> sound as an inference rule in modal logic. In other words, it doesn't mean we have to restrict ourselves to the sound inference rules of classical logic. There are sound inference rules for modal logic: the only problem is that if the premises are modal logic formulas (e.g., \xce\x93=\xce\xa6), then the conclusions are also modal logic formulas.</p><br><p>This is really crazy, and it's not just that this is a result of using two different formal systems together: if one of those systems is allowed to assume the soundness of its opponent's system, another system is allowed to assume its own soundness. But how can you get soundness to hold in this setting? For one system, let's assume the soundness axioms of second-order arithmetic: \xcf\x80\xe2\x8a\xa2\xce\x93\xe2\x86\x94\xe2\x8a\xa4 is sound for the first system, given (classical) second-order logic, and \xcf\x80 itself encodes second-order arithmetic, so \xcf\x80\xe2\x8a\x87\xce\x93 is sound for the second system, which contains second-order arithmetic. So for a formal system S, \xcf\x80\xe2\x8a\x91S\xe2\x8a\xa2\xce\x96 means we can get all logical conclusions from the premises given modus ponens, modus tollens, schema of specification, etc. for S. How is this possible when we allow the two-argument substitution in our inference rule above?</p><br><p>This may all seem obvious from the outside view, but intuitionistically, the behavior of modal logic can get rather odd as you start using axioms that in fact contain modal variables. What I found interesting was that <em>even without substitution rules</em>, classical logic can be used as one of the two formal systems for modal logic. The "other" system must itself be classical logic, but each individual formula (e.g. a first-order formula) in the system has its own free quantifier, giving modal logic formulas such as \xce\x93=\xe2\x8a\xa1\xcf\x86(f1,...,fi)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x8a\xa4, \xcf\x86 being the formula corresponding to the formula in the system. In modal logic, we can define \xce\x93=\xe2\x88\x80x:\xcf\x86(x), where <em>we must specify the formula \xcf\x86 itself</em> in the system we are using, rather than using modal formula expressions that refer directly to a formula in the other system. The formula \xcf\x86 then has free quantifiers and has the free variable denoted by x. Note that I'm using lowercase lettering for both the formula and the formula symbol inside modal formula, \xce\xbd=\xce\xa8, even though they will be distinct in some cases. So one of the two is a modal formula and \xcf\x86 is really modal formula.</p><br><p>This kind of "cross-talk" between different formal systems is normal in computational logic. This kind of behavior, however, has led to some strange results in the study of modal logic, such as the behavior of soundness and completeness results being inconsistent. (Again, this is normal in computational logical: soundness and completess is a statement about the behavior of algorithms on one specific problem, which means that their behavior on <em>other</em> problems might be very different. Also, because of the incompleteness of the halting problem, we actually have to have some assumption about what the other problem is.)</p><br><p>I have this feeling that the study of intuitionistic logic is really incomplete or confused in places. There are things one can say about it that are pretty obvious from the outside, but that the people interested in intuitionistic logic just fail to see when they look at it from the outside. For example, the fact that modal logic can be used to prove that the behavior of PA is consistent <em>while classical logic cannot prove the same fact</em>. Some very interesting results have been found in intuitionistic logic, and this result is one of them.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
