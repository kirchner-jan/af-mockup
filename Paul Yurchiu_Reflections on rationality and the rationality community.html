</ul><br><p><strong>Follow up to:</strong> Reflections from the EA Hotel_After spending two months in Copenhagen, and a week in the EA Hotel, my reflections and reflections on rationality, the rationality community, EA, and Effective Altruism have finally come to a conclusion. I would feel happier if the two years spent here were not a failure; it would be easier to reflect on that time if I didn't spend every second agonizing over it, but instead to feel like I left the village without saying goodbye. I don't even feel like I learned much about rationality. I got a bunch of insights into human nature, some useful vocabulary, and maybe I will figure out a bit more about decision theory, and maybe I'll find something I can apply to my life. On the other side of the coin, I feel like I really learned a few things about the EA movement: a few useful things that I can remember and communicate to other people who would like to have something in common. But for the most part, I had little idea how to explain all of it or of the implications._</p><br><p><em>I'm quite frustrated with myself for not being able to write a post about my thoughts, because that would have allowed other people to reflect on these issues for a bit and I would have gotten a bit of feedback.</em></p><br><p><em>I think a major problem here is that I don't see the current way of practicing rationality as rational. LessWrong is the closest thing to a rational-sphere that I know (maybe it's not that different from the rationality on Overcoming Bias, but I haven't really taken the time to check). And, from what I could tell, most of the rationality practiced on LessWrong comes from CFAR. And CFAR is an attempt to provide that kind of rationality, but in a more systematic, professional way. One of the major differences being that it's aimed at a much larger audience of people who have more of a problem with rationality than I do, and who are using the term "rational" differently. That's probably the thing that people don't see when they look at LessWrong: it's the difference between a blog and a curriculum. I don't think I get the best out of blogs like that.</em></p><br><p><em>I haven't read all of this so it may be obvious to the LessWrong community how stupid this was, but it feels to me as if people on LessWrong are not following the advice they give.</em></p><br><p>Reflections on LessWriff</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Don't believe all you read on blogs. And remember that blogs have to compete with TV, motion pictures, novels, and even video games! LessWrong has to compete with Twitter and Reddit!  \xe2\x80\x93 Raemon</p>
</blockquote><br><p>There's a lot of truth in that; some posts are better than others, and "good enough" is the best that can be hoped for. </p><br><p>Reflections as they are presently practiced</p><br><p>We read LessWrong because we want to be rational, whether or not we know whether we're succeeding. We're often not aware of our irrationality and so we may have read many LessWrong posts and not thought about whether we do have any irrationality in our personality, and then we try to apply the lessons to real life. </p><br><p>A lot times, these are good practices \xe2\x80\x93 trying to apply the lessons one has learned on LessWrong (I did this) is pretty good. After some time, we forget about the LessWrong post (this happens in 10 day increments) and continue in our way.</p><br><p>But if we want to actually become "rational", these are not sufficient. Most of LessWrong's posts are not trying to help us be rational, they're merely trying to be funny, and in some cases, are trying to be insightful but fail terribly at this. And in the last few months things have been getting more and more serious. People are not just trying to be funny anymore, we are trying to be more rational and more effective. Because LessWrong is not trying to be systematic and actually trying to help. </p><br><p><em>For most posts, the first and most important feedback for the author is not whether it is more important to be rational or not, but whether it is a good read and/\xe2\x80\x8bor whether it is making us feel more or less capable of being rational. This is especially relevant for posts about rationality, because that's what LessWrong has become. A community for discussing rational things, that you can post on if you think the topic is relevant \xe2\x80\x93 not a community for actually helping people become more rational. But, because LessWrong has largely become an "is", rather than an "is-how-to" community, getting better at using reason becomes a lower priority.</em></p><br><p><em>For all posts, there's a "this is good, but" button, and if you believe you can do better, it would be good if you do better, and people will let you know if they believe your claim to do better. This could be anything from a few words, to the comment section, to an extended comment.</em></p><br><p>Reflection on "rationality", as practiced LessWrong</p><br><p>An update</p><br><p>What can be done to improve the LessWrong experience? Firstly, users could have an option to turn specific posts into "rationality" posts, so they can be optimized for rationality without affecting the aesthetics of LessWrong as a whole. Even better would be to give users better access to the LessWrontalk room (currently only admins can see if there's a video up or if it's just chat), so they could have the possibility to use it to their advantage. </p><br><p>Secondly, the LessWrong authors can try to make posts more focused on the art of rationality, rather than on the object level. This would mean more explicit goal posts, such as the ones proposed by Eliezer, and having some posts consist of several related posts. </p><br><p>Lastly, we should be able to have a community post where a specific author or group, post the most important rationality posts they have over the years, and we can vote on those posts that need improvement to be voted in. To avoid turning LessWrong into a "rationality textbook" this post should have a specific focus \xe2\x80\x93 such as the rationalist community rather than individual rationalist writers, or something else. </p><br><p>Looking forward</p><br><p>Reflection, when all this is written off, sounds like a positive thing. But, if it's actually the best we can do, after spending two years learning about LessWrong rationality, is it a positive or negative thing? </p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
