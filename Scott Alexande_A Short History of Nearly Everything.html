In addition to the main story (which is short), there are side stories which are fascinating and sometimes hilarious. The chapter on Shakespeare, in particular, makes me wonder what Shakespeare's personal taste in bedtime stories was. The book is also full of fascinating facts, but I won't go into detail on all of them. It's a great book if you like history and want your Christmas shopping done in April.</em></p><br><p>For most Christians, Christmas is just a time to be with family.</p><br><p>If you believe in the virgin birth, that's how you learn it. You don't learn it by studying the Bible. Some Christians say it's the word of God in man's hand, and others that it's divinely inspired by God speaking through the bible, or by God speaking through their faith \xe2\x80\x93 in either case they all agree on the facts but the meaning is a big mystery.</p><br><p>But if you ask why they have that belief... they'll tell you "Well, there are all these reports from ancient pilgrims that Jesus was born on Dec. 25th, that the first thing His parents did was call themselves parents, and that the wise men said that His parents were very poor, which shows that Jesus wouldn't be born if His parents had been really lucky."</p><br><p>(This is a very strange and suspicious way of thinking \xe2\x80\x93 if Jesus' parents really were so poor, then why is Joseph the spouse of an exceptionally wealthy woman, and why was Mary one of Jesus' disciples? And what business does any of that have on whether Christ was born on Dec 25th in Bethlehem? \xe2\x80\x93 but it's how everyone <em>learns</em> Christianity, so they <em>all</em> assume that when they read the Bible it makes perfect, obvious sense. So it's the way that people <em>tell</em> the story that is more mysterious.)</p><br><p>It's interesting to note just how much the New Testament contradicts the Old Testament. For example, both mention the Ark leaving the Ark. The New Testament says that it was made of cherubs while the Ark of the covenant was made of gold. The Old Testament says that the Ark was built by the children of Israel while the Ark of God was built by the superintelligent gods of Egypt. The New Testament claims that Jesus was prophesied to die for our sins while the Old Testament prophesies that Abraham's sacrifice will be punished for the sins of the whole world. The New Testament gives a detailed history of all of Western and Central Europe while the Old Testament only gives a bunch of vague archeological hints (like 'the city of Nahal Hever was built along the Khiamet River').</p><br><p>It's also interesting to note the similarities between the Old and New Testament accounts. For example, the story of Noah has some obvious connections, not just between the two Old Testament stories but also between the three flood stories in the Old Testament. There is one other story in the Old Testament (Jonah in the whale!) that's so similar to both the Old and New that it seems difficult not to at least assign some small measure of credibility to the New Testament account.</p><br><p>The New Testament is only one of two books, the other being The Book of Job, which tells the story of an innocent peasant girl who is brought down to the underworld and becomes an instrument of justice when the rest of the universe is threatened by the super-evil God of Darkness.</p><br><p>The Book of Job is only 3,000 words long, and there is the question of whether or not Job had children (he says he didn't, but there is the story of Job's daughters).  On the other hand, the Old Testament has books like Isaiah, which is 1,800, and there's a story in that book called The Ascension of Isaiah in which Isaiah meets his son Maher-Shalal-Hashbaz, and they hang out together. There are the books of Jacob and Judith, which each exceed 300 pages.</p><br><p>In between the Book of Job and Judith is a book called "The Wisdom of Solomon", which contains 6,500 words. <em>The Wisdom of Solomon</em> is really big, because it's the only book in the Old Testament that tells the story of the birth of David from God's wife.</p><br><p>In fact, The Book of Job is so short and The Wisdom of Solomon is so long that it makes sense to start them halfway through Book of Job and end them in Judith.</p><br><p>We thus have four books in the Old Testament: Job, The Book of Genesis, The Book of Exodus, and The Books of Samuel and Job. By the early 3rd century C.E. the book of Genesis had its own book as an epilogue (the book of Deuteronomy).  As for the rest, there is nothing to say.</p><br><p>If it's hard for us to tell which parts of which Old Testament books are likely to be true, why should _they _be sure? We have no way to know when God is speaking to them through His prophet Elijah, when God is speaking through His prophet Isaiah, or when God is speaking directly through the prophet Jeremiah. After all, God speaks directly through Job 1:12-6.</p><br><p>And yet, most Christians say that all of the Old Testament is the word of God, and therefore they don't believe the New Testament. They have a very good understanding of the Old Testament, much better than they have a very good explanation of the New Testament.</p><br><p>We don't normally regard the writers of ancient books as being credible enough to even <em>consider</em> the possibility that they lied. But when you see a book like Book of Job, it seems entirely reasonable to think the New Testament account with its multiple characters, stories of miracles, and multiple miracles is _not _inspired by the same author as Job, which only describes a single event.</p><br><p>Or consider the Book of Thessalonians. The Thessalonians asked whether God would one day "return to judge the world." Most Christians say that this is about the future Rapture, in which God will return for all of us at once and then give himself to be nailed right into the skull of a Roman soldier for the sins of humanity.</p><br><p>Yet the book of Thessalonius is the only book of the New Testament that explicitly describes a specific prophecy, and it also describes the exact details of that prophecy for the exact date it will take place.</p><br><p>But don't take my word for it \xe2\x80\x93 I'll give you a hint:  <em>the Bible has been copied</em>; you can see a copy of the Book of The-ssalonians right here at the Library of Congress. It's on shelf number 1518. You may have to search in several stacks, but not too hard. Don't be shy; it only takes a moment.</p><br><p>If there's a God, it's not the God of Job, or of Isaiah, or of the New Testament, or anything else in the Old Testament, because those books were written hundreds or even thousands of years after Job, Isaiah, and the New Testament. When the Bible was translated to Latin (in the 12th century) it had been lost for over 700 years. Job would still be waiting on his children. Isaiah would have gotten around to writing about the fall of Samaria sometime in the 3rd century. The New Testament would not have been written for another 800 or so years.</p><br><p>The Bible has one major flaw:  it claims the Old Testament came from the prophet Elijah, but it took him <em>centuries</em> to get there, and the only account of Elijah that we have appears in the Prophets of Israel, not the Prophets of Solomon.</p><br><p>All sorts of conspiracy theories about this problem have been floated \xe2\x80\x93 the Elijah account was taken from one of God's prophets in the 11th century, who heard the voice of God in the 11th book of the Prophets, and <em>also</em> the Prophets of <em>Solomon</em>, which is a bunch of stuff about wisdom and judgment. Or the Prophets of Elijah was copied backwards. Or Elijah is Elijah the Patriarch, not Elijah the Prophet. Or that the Old Testament is a translation from a different Hebrew text than the one Jesus spoke it from.</p><br><p>On the other hand, there's a book called <em>The Book of the Twelve Prophets</em> in which, every other book except for the last one, <em>also</em> comes from the Prophet Elijah. There is one minor detail in the original story that made some of the first translators consider it not credible, and that they added a whole bunch of commentary in order to explain why Elijah was only willing to leave his house for the top of the Carmel mountain, and <em>not</em> for Mt. Tabor which the translator thought might have been more likely.</p><br><p>At the end of the New Testament there was a book called Revelation, which we also have to assume was written by some prophet named John. But John was prophesied to be on Mars at the time of the Rapture, not Tabor. There's even the claim that Revelation was a late-writing prophecy written only in the 19th century, which seems unlikely to be true.</p><br><p>When you add it all up, the case for the Biblical view of history looks to me like:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
