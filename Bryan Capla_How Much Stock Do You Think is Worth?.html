It's the best analysis I came up with, but it's likely to err massively\xe2\x80\x94the point is that I think you need to have an idea. I hope to revisit and improve this sometime.</em></p><br><p><strong>Suppose you want __________$100,000.00. You work your ass off, save a _____ billion dollars, and buy an index fund that passively tracks the S&amp;P 500. You think you have a pretty good sense of what the S&amp;P is worth\xe2\x80\x94at least _____$700,000,000.00, plus/\xe2\x80\x8bminus, based on your experiences so far\xe2\x80\x94what you're going to do with your extra money at various future points in time?</strong></p><br><p>Let's try one more time to tease out the answer. There are two ways you could spend your money. One is that you could just keep your money. That's saving. You could also decide to spend it as a <em>flow-through</em>\xe2\x80\x94making your money grow faster or slower, so that it grows to some greater amount more quickly, or less quickly. This money will eventually be spent as a future return on investment by someone else, or otherwise converted to cash. But before that happens, it will have grown to some <em>higher</em> amount\xe2\x80\x94you'll call it the "long-run growth rate" of the money.</p><br><p>So, now you have options on your money. You can either save it, or you can spend it. If you spend it, you will also have a flow-through amount that can grow faster or slower. By the time you get to spend the whole amount of <strong><em>_</em>$100,0000.00, you or someone else will have made one (or more) additional </strong>___  dollars, because of your choice to save (or spend) the money.</p><br><p>\tThat's the point of this story: your money was saved, and it earned interest, so your return on investment has been positive.</p><br><p>Now we return to our initial question: how much value do you think is in your <strong><em>_</em> </strong>$100,000__? By comparing this question to our second one, we see that this question asks "How many future dollars will be earned or spent?" while our second question asks "How much return on investment will one of those dollars have in the future?"</p><br><p>Thus, there are two reasons that I think a better way would be to answer the first question, and ignore the second:</p><br><ol>
<li>The two questions can never be truly answered at once.</li>
</ol><br><ol>
<li>You get better answers by "taking an expected value" of the two questions together.</li>
</ol><br><p>I believe that 1 is extremely important. If you only ask the first question, then you'll get a different answer when you decide how much to save, and when you decide when to withdraw some money into a high-yield bond. For example, I think if you just take a random date and ask what your money on that date will be worth, you will get a radically different result from what you will get when you do a Monte-Carlo analysis for your own money based on the past.</p><br><p>But if you want to use the expected value formula, it's a lot easier to calculate than if you are trying to calculate the exact value of one variable from another. And using the formula can help you see errors in your reasoning, which can be hard to spot when you try to reason about a single factor or single variable.</p><br><p>In general, this is a good way to think about most math: to calculate the expected value of a set of factors that may be correlated, and to find the formula, you do the long, hard calculation in your head (that is, the "calculate an expec ted value"), but <em>then</em> you plug in the value of all the factors and see <em>exactly how much good or bad</em> you have done.</p><br><p>(Note: the second reason is not an intrinsic advantage of the first question, but a practical disadvantage of the second question.)</p><br><p><strong>Exercise (the hard way): How much stock do you think is worth? What's your expected return on your investment? And will your investment earn interest, or just sit there? What's the probability you'll make money if you buy?</strong></p><br><p>I'll start by describing how I think it might be possible to answer this problem: first we calculate a range of possible value that could be in the <strong><em>_</em>$100000, and then we use a Monte-Caro simulation. To calculate the range of possible value, we look at historical data on how much assets have historically gained/\xe2\x80\x8blost in price per share, and use the standard deviation to estimate a range of possible values. We then create 50 Monte Carlo simulations of this process and get a distribution (with a normal kernel) of possible returns, in each of the 50 simulations, with each simulation having a new randomness in the returns. You then multiply all these numbers together to get a distribution of possible values. One of those values will have a greater than normal return, and another will have a greater loss, or a value that seems obviously crazy. But if you take the <em>median</em> of this distribution, you've answered the question\xe2\x80\x94you will have more than  </strong>___$100k.00 on hand in 10 years._</p><br><p>To calculate the Monte-Caro price, you take the market value of the company, subtract from this a weighted sum of the market's cost of capital (i.e. the market discount rate on a one- to ten-year term) for the type of security you're buying, and a stock's estimated annual return on equity (as reported in a financial press report, if necessary).</p><br><p>The process can get computationally expensive as you need to do more simulations, so I don't usually try to do this kind of calculation myself. But I understand that others do and think this is a reasonable estimate. There are two problems with this kind of calculation:</p><br><p>a. It doesn't account for other possibilities: for example, if there <em>wasn't</em> enough value in the company to justify the price (e.g. the current price is completely irrational), it wouldn't make any difference whether you bought or sold. Then you would either break even, make a bit more money or lose a bit less money (the price is a good guide when you expect the stock to go up or down), but you would do about as well as the market regardless of what the answer was. Thus, your answer to the question is "I don't know," or "too difficult to answer."</p><br><p>b. It doesn't adjust for how irrational markets can be on a particular day (i.e., it doesn't account for your private information); that is, it doesn't take into account that if you think there <em>might not be enough value in the stock</em>, you should buy today. Again, if you think the price is totally insane, its price today will be determined by information you don't know. In order to correct for this, you need to perform a separate Monte-Caro analysis today, before your purchase, to get a "correct" price if you're a "sophisticated investor" aware of the true value of the company and the market.</p><br><p>So if you can't answer this question directly, you can ask a different question that will give an answer about the same value: "Can I get more than _____$100 K back in ten years by investing my money for at least the next ten years?"</p><br><p>This is the better question. Let's try to answer it: in the next ten years, you could make $500,000 by investing your $100,000 in an index fund and not making any more. If you have good news is that you can get back at least $500k, but you don't make any more than that, you are making it back. By the time that happens, you'll have at least made $100k as your investment, so taking that much money and giving it to the S&amp;P will cost you $500k more. And you can do this for more than ten years, so your final loss is still $0, but over ten years you have at least earned a positive net amount.</p><br><p>So the question becomes, what's your probability you can earn back at least $100k? I'd say it's about 50%. You've lived your life investing your money, you're in good health, you have good taste. You've read some history books about the stock market. You may have friends on Wall Street, or hedge funds, or the financial security industry. If you look on the newspaper or on TV, you can find an unbiased report about the S&amp;P. You can look at historical price data. You can watch the market in person. You may know something about the state of the economy. You can consult a good economics textbook. After all this, you might be able to earn back at least some value by following the index, with a bit of luck. The stock market isn't completely random\xe2\x80\x94investors know that it will do well in the future, but they don't know exactly when, and they can use their judgement in choosing between bets, but they won't be able to spot the trend-changes or predict individual companies or tell at a glance if S&amp;P 500 will outperform on the next hundred days.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
