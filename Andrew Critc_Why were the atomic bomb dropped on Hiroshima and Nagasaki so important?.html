</ul><br><p>The Nagasaki bombing and <em>The Little Boy</em></p><br><p>The Nagasaki bomb exploded in the city of Nagasaki. On August 9, 1945, the city was hit by a single 50 kiloton bomb dropped from a B-29 (a long-range, high-altitude plane). This bomb dropped on an inhabited city without warning. The Japanese military force on the harbor island in which the city was situated, had no chance to react.</p><br><p>The event itself was part of the broader firebombing of Japanese cities that followed the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6. Nagasaki was a significant source of Japanese casualties, with about 20,000 casualties. Nagasaki is also remembered as the first US attack on Japan, which the US military code named "Point C".</p><br><p><em>The Little Boy_On August 25, 1945, a B-29 hit Hiroshima with a single 5 kiloton bomb, with no warning. This was the first large-scale human extinction event due to _de novo</em> synthetic nuclear explosive. There were about 60,000 killed in the blast and a citywide fire that consumed about 90 percent of the city.</p><br><p>It was in the aftermath that two of the key decisions made in bringing the war to a peaceful resolution were made.</p><br><p>First, the US did decide to use a tactical nuclear weapon on Nagasaki. Second, if doing so had still not been enough to establish peace, the US decided to use a strategic weapon on another city, Hiroshima, in order to establish <em>de facto</em> world peace. This decision was made by Truman in his presidential meeting with Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall that was on July 26, 1945, and was also the genesis of the atomic bomb treaty through UN Security Council Resolution 90.</p><br><p>Atom bomb treaty is important in its own right, but I find its narrative, and the story of the atomic bomb, important in the understanding of nuclear war. So in this essay I'll discuss the atomic bomb treaty and its role in world affairs, and how this has been a cultural touchstone in popular culture. I'll also point out some key historical and cultural differences that explain the US and Russia's unique approaches to nuclear war, and why Russia's nuclear arsenal is so large.</p><br><p>I should note some ground-level facts about Japan that contributed to the cultural significance of the bomb. One is that Japanese culture has historically been pacifist and peace-seeking. Japan is still committed to its efforts not to declare war, and Japan has a military force roughly the size of the US Army Corps. The Japanese military was a large supporter of American efforts to contain communism in Asia. Many Japanese supported the Axis powers during WW II, including some resistance. I'm a little surprised Japan has never been involved in wars with other countries since their founding about 200 years ago, although given that it has been through wars in China and Korea, this may be due to cultural norms of mutual cooperation.</p><br><p>Nuclear weapons, unlike artillery shells or machine guns, are _de novo _synthetic explosives that produce nuclear chain reactions. They are explosive bombs of vastly greater destructive power than anything that existed in 1805.</p><br><p>Nuclear bombs, unlike artillery and machine guns, have a range of a few thousand miles, meaning that the target area doesn't have to be in a major population concentration. You cannot just drop a bomb on a major military target and have everything instantly be destroyed. In fact, this was never a serious threat in combat because of the range of the weapon. Even if you did have such a weapon, you wouldn't have enough explosives to sustain a firebombing campaign on a given target that didn't have significant population centers (civilization) in it. This was the case and could be changed if necessary.</p><br><p>Nuclear weapon destruction is less dependent on the terrain. For example, even if you could use nuclear weapons to knock out an enemy airbase, an enemy airbase wouldn't have the population density for the effects to be much of a deterrent. So you could drop a nuclear weapon on a target that could sustain a firebomb without having to worry about being able to survive enemy counterattacks.</p><br><p>The Nagasaki Bombing and the Nuclear Age</p><br><p>The Nagasaki nuclear-armed bombs came out of a brief period of American isolationism that had been in motion for more than 50 years. The isolationist stance was in line with the American general desire to have no one dictate to them what they could and could not do. President Truman wanted to prevent the spread of communism and atomic weapons were part of that goal.</p><br><p>But isolationism ended when the Soviet Union invaded Germany in 1944. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place on August 6, 1945, shortly after the Soviet Union had liberated Berlin. The US administration wanted to establish the authority to use nuclear weapons in emergencies after Germany surrendered unconditionally to the Allies; Truman had approved the use of a few nuclear weapons in anger during the battle at Okinawa, with the result that the Russians would be left in control of the Japanese islands.</p><br><p>The Nagaki bomb was about a hundred times more destructive than the one dropped on Hiroshima. That made the Nagasaki bombing one hundred times more destructive on a country that had been under constant fire bombing for months. The United States was so confident that it was establishing its authority in the use of these weapons, the first time they had ever been used, that it dropped the Nagasaki bomb so early that there will be no survivors to protest it, even though the weapon was used as a means of coercion rather than self-defense, to establish its authority.</p><br><p>The United States took possession of the Japanese islands with the goal of establishing a new "free world" state of the US on a broad basis, that would eventually include a United States of America, by any means necessary to establish control over them. The United States of America is no one else's business, to be used or not used for any reason.</p><br><p>If you are not one of the peoples of Earth and you have not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, you are not entitled to have them as a state. If you do not like that reality, join the club. The US and Russia are the only countries in the club.</p><br><p>The United Nations (UN) was originally established to maintain world peace by preventing wars, but over time they had to broaden to include other issues, including how to handle nuclear weapons.</p><br><p>The Treaty of Non-Proliferated Nuclear Weapons was initially sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union as a way of showing their strength and resolving the issue of the atomic bomb. Today, nuclear weapons have been established as a world safety issue, because nuclear weapons are no longer needed to establish world peace. Nuclear war is considered unsafe, and is prohibited by a broad base of treaty commitments. These treaties include the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the "Atoms for Peace" treaty), the Non-Profit Agreement on the Non-Nuclear Weapons, and various nuclear safeguards treaties such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty and the Non-Proximal Weapons Treaty.</p><br><p>On August 29, 1954, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Atoms for Peace treaty at the United Nations. Other signatories include the United Kingdom, the Republic of China, and France. It is now widely used as a negotiating and drafting document for more specific, universal treaties.</p><br><p>The first international treaty on the development of atomic weapons, and the control of their proliferation beyond two parties, was the Partial Test Ban of 1963. In essence, this treaty prohibited any country from using atomic weapons on any other country, without first seeking safe and lawful agreement from the signatory countries. It took some time for the treaties to spread, but over time it became the international custom (or norm, if you will) that no country would ever use them. They are generally considered a peaceful way of ending war without violence.</p><br><p>The US signed the Non-Provisional Weapons treaty in 1968, while the USSR did not. It did not have a text, due to that fact. It had twenty-two signatories of which only the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were party to it. The United States had six such signatures, with the remaining twenty countries being party, but not signatories. Many of these countries were "associate parties" or "associate members" of the United Nations. They included major European powers, such as France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Some countries that joined later signed.</p><br><p>On August 23, 1968, the USSR declared that China, the People's Republic would never be a party. This action had implications for the Partial Test Ban, as well as the Non-Provement weapons treaty. The UN Security Council voted 15-3 in favor of the Soviet Union's motion to admit PR China into the Non-Protest and Ban on May 24, 1973. It was approved 17-7 the next day.</p><br><p>The Chinese invasion of India was the beginning of the end of the British Empire. Many people are unaware that the United Kingdom has held on to East Indian territories, Burma until 2020, and formerly controlled Hong Kong up until 1997 under another name.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
