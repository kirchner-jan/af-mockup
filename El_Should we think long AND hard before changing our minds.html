<li>Does reasoning well and quickly help you?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Can it improve your decisions that people disagree with you on? </li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>On the contrary, some decisions and beliefs require longer than 2 hours to decide on.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>There are a couple reasons to think a little and a little.</li>
</ul><br><p>I want this post to include a few arguments to decide what to think and how to think in various instances of people in the wild. Not just the rational ones. Some practical examples about how to behave in social situations.</p><br><p>What do you do first? Do you run a process or do you make a decision to change your mind?</p><br><p>This post is for trying to understand and model the way that humans actually reason. And the results of this are the following:</p><br><p><strong>The post is about changing your mind and thinking longer about that decision</strong>:</p><br><p>Does reasoning well and quickly <em>help</em> you? Or does it take time to reason and make sure that you are in the right territory.</p><br><p>For example, you have to change your mind if you have information that updates the model you hold. It might be relevant later, and so taking time to think hard changes it.</p><br><p>Or it might not be relevant yet, but it could be relevant down the line. So changing it now changes it.</p><br><p>Or it is relevant and useful in another context. So again, changing it now changes its context. If you have a lot of context, changing a lot could be an issue. So the same kind of situation could have different effects in different contexts.</p><br><p><strong>Can it improve your decisions (if and when) people disagree with you?</strong> </p><br><p>In many instances of disagreeing with someone who is an expert in their field and they have a lot of information that you do not, you are basically wrong. </p><br><p>People have lived it and you don't know about it. If the context of that situation is not relevant in that other person's expertise and how good they are at thinking then you are just wrong. </p><br><p><strong>In the case of science, you will disagree with most scientists about facts that they know more than you do. If the facts in question relate to the question you most want to know that is a <em>good</em> thing.</strong></p><br><p>If you have a disagreement with someone who is the leader of a country then you are probably wrong about something pretty important, but that is something you can try to get help about.</p><br><p>But if you have an issue with someone being the leader and they are not being the leader correctly they probably know more than you, but that doesn't mean you are wrong about anything.</p><br><p>In most places in the world, most of the times most people disagree about what decision-relevant facts about a decision-relevant thing are not things that most people know more about than you. That's probably a <em>good</em> reason to doubt your conclusion. </p><br><p><strong>On the contrary, some <em>important</em> decisions and beliefs require having the time to think and gather information from many different angles, including a long time for very complex cases where everything is relevant, and also time for other processes</strong>.</p><br><p>For some things it is better to get multiple views and opinions to get the right answer. And for some things it is more important to get it right the first time and hold yourself to a higher standard.</p><br><p>So how do you decide?</p><br><p>If you want to know more about what decision-process to use, I recommend this paper:</p><br><p>http://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8btowardsdatascience.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8btwo-processes-for-data-science-the-toward-data-science/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b</p><br><p>If that seems like enough to say to just go check it out and then come back, you can skip checking it out and I hope that is ok.</p><br><p>If you are convinced that having a long process and taking the time to be more rational <em>can</em> help you figure out how to be better at deciding things, then you are also probably interested in this paper I found while searching for resources or ideas:</p><br><p>http:\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.scotthyoung.com/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bhow-evidence-convinces-people.html</p><br><p>If you disagree, then the next part of this post is your turn to explain why you disagree for those of you that chose not to be convinced that having two different modes of thinking is a good idea. I mean, I'd like to be convinced that my model of how to think about this is more accurate. So how do you think about it if you are the kind of person who has a decision and you want to make the best possible decisions. </p><br><p>To avoid misunderstanding, I am not here to convince you that you don't know more, or don't have good reason to go on a walk and think for five minutes; as mentioned in the title of this post.</p><br><p>I just want to ask you what sort of decisions and beliefs need different sorts of processing to figure out what to do. What processes am I most likely to benefit from?</p><br><p>And more importantly, how can I encourage my most rationalist friends to process their decisions in a different way than they usually do?</p><br><p>This could be as specific as a particular decision, or it could be a general problem with their processing mechanisms.</p><br><p>To begin, I hope this post has been helpful.</p><br><p>Please comment if you disagree with this. I am interested in understanding what processes people benefit from <em>while they actually are making the decision</em>, to figure out how to change the decision-making process from what it is now. To see if I can figure out what advice to give to help people on making better decisions. And I hope it helps me make better decisions in turn.</p><br><p>And if there are any questions, here are resources I found looking for this post idea:</p><br><p>http</p><br><p>https://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ben.wikipedia.org/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwiki/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bDecision_Theory</p><br><p>http://\xe2\x80\x8bwww.scottyyoung.com/\xe2\x80\x8bhow-evidence-convinces-people.html\xe2\x80\x94Scott Young has a great intro on this.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
