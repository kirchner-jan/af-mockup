</ul><br><p>Background</p><br><p>This article is a response to Christiano Yudkowsky's call for more serious thought regarding the future of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. </p><br><p><strong>Background</strong></p><br><p>I believe that the historical period of the deinstitulatiorization movement can be seen as the beginning of the end, not only for psychotherapy but for psychiatry as such, the notion of which as the mind-killer is already well known. It is not clear to me whether it is actually the last stage of psychiatry, the last stage of medical psychiatry, the last state of mental hospitals. But still, the end of the history of psychotherapy, the history of psychiatry, and the history of mental hospitals, is a topic I care a lot about. </p><br><p>So, let's have a look at past ideas in psychiatric history: first, the emergence of psychoanalysis in the early twentieth century: psychiatry in its origins, Freud's theories, some other theories, and, of course, psychiatry in its current form and future development. </p><br><p>Second, let's take a look at the moralistic therapeutic deinstitutionalization movement. This movement came along after the end of Nazism in Europe and has a direct line of ancestry with Marxism. I would be interested in the Marxist roots of the movement, but this question has not been addressed by either of us, so I guess it will not be part of this article (it may of importance though).</p><br><p>Third, let's have look at psychoanalysis in some of its most anti-mentalistic versions: psychoanalysis as an anti-enlightenment, anti-science, anti-humanist "proletkult" movement.</p><br><p>Finally, let's take some typical (for psychoanalysis) anti-humanist moral beliefs: "do not talk to children", "do not let children talk to children", the belief in the existence of a general anti-intellectualism in the general population.</p><br><p>So, the idea of modern psychotherapy started with Sigmund Freud, and it was built on a model of human nature that was highly suspicious of human thought and human intellect, and advocated a whole series of anti-humanist beliefs. And later, when Marxism came up, some thinkers adopted some of these anti-intellectualist beliefs and promoted them as their own, such as Karl Marx, the founder of Marxist-Leninism.</p><br><p><strong>A Brief History of Psychosis</strong></p><br><p>Background</p><br><p>The history of psychosis and psychosis prevention goes back centuries. It was described already in the seventeenth century in the work <em>De melancholia</em> by Thomas Willis (translated into Italian by Cesare Cremonini the same century and published in 1663), where he says: </p><br><p><strong>Every disease, even the greatest diseases, such as those of the head, are caused by the same three enemies\xe2\x80\x94hunger, sorrow and cold\xe2\x80\x94so that they may often be helped but also cured, not without much good temperance and careful nursing, so much as it has also appeared clearly to me that many of the most dangerous diseases may be entirely prevented by the art of philosophy, if one may find the right way to treat them; by the way, the author of this article had a chance, in his own country and in others, to observe how patients fell into these disorders, how they were cured by the best physicians, but also how they were, by the contrary, continually produced and maintained, even when not attacked by these illnesses, for the purpose of pleasure and profit: for, in any age, a great number of men and women become possessed with these diseases simply because a certain temperance of their affairs, or other particular habits of life, are not practised, or are incautiously practised; or because they lead them to the enjoyment of some pleasures or amusements, whose continuation they are addicted to, or whose cessation they will not consent to for some particular time... And this illness is no less dangerous for its frequent occurrence, than it is also pernicious and inconvenient for its cure\xe2\x80\x94either by reason of the disease being incurable or by reason of the remedies and practices in use being very crude, harsh and even hurtful to the patients.</strong>[1]__</p><br><p>For him, the treatment of "delusions and delusions" involved the search for some unknown, magical, and in some cases even evil substance, and its production in large quantities; the magical action of the substance is aimed at calming down the "sick person". "That which should be the end, namely, that the devil may not be able in his tyranny by preventing man's being and existence, and that man may live and develop according to his own free will, he will be forced in an endeavour through various means and under great stress, namely, through the help and care of his friends and his enemies in conjunction."</p><br><p>In 1745 Francis Bernoulli, who was a great pioneer of physics, tried to explain certain strange phenomena of his experiments in terms of spirit, and even thought of the possibility of creating spirits of air to move objects, etc. But the phenomena described "by Bernoulli would not have been understood as psychic phenomena, but as some kind of materialization and animated power within air itself, or of a mysterious essence in air itself, either in man or in other animals". However, such a view could not be accepted by the medical authorities. The medical interpretation of Bernoulli's ideas was that spirits of air existed when they were generated by a strong effort and caused movements in the air, and the movements in the air were analogous to thoughts.</p><br><p>Then came some philosophers in the second half of the seventeenth century, especially David Locke and Anthony Condorcet. They, too, were convinced that man was basically the same in all respects except for his thinking process. In short, in one of the oldest philosophical theories, man is essentially the same in body and mind! So, their idea of "delusions of thought" and "delusions of body" were simply the same thing, "imaginations".</p><br><p><strong>From Philosophy to Psycho-Analysis</strong></p><br><p>Then comes Francis Galton, who published work in which he tried to prove the continuity of human nature. First he demonstrated the similarity between different languages and dialects. And after that he searched for the general features of the human character, such as honesty, courage, and self-interest etc.</p><br><p>In the 1760's, the idea of human difference became popular in England, and it was called "naturism" and "monism", because this was an idea invented by Francis Bacon, according to whom man is essentially the exactly the same thing both in body and in mental faculties. Some writers called "naturist" and "monist" were later accused of denying in the worst way the mind-body dualism (a view of human nature that claims that mind and body are two completely separate and different entities)[2].</p><br><p>The most radical form of naturism was the belief in a naturalistic, animistic, and determinist human nature, with no more hidden parts or qualities than that. In this radical form, the difference between men and animals was considered merely as a quantitative difference: men have more brain, a greater number of muscles and bones, more blood, more "vital matter", more mental capacity and more intellectual qualities. Naturists believed that because of this difference of mental capacities, man deserves better treatment. A typical formulation of "naturism", which was used by John Millar as a subtitle for his novel <em>Vestiges de la premiere \xc3\xa9cole du mois</em>, was as follows: "It can be said that the development of the body is the foundation of the whole social and political progress of man; for from it, the soul is formed and the mental faculties develop."[3]</p><br><p><em>The Human Figure</em> by William Hogarth shows a person from the left as a wild, dirty, cruel savage:</p><br><p>The other extreme was represented by Joseph Fourier and other followers of Jean-Charles Bonnet, who considered the soul as an epiphenomenon of human nature: it exists only for the purpose of explaining complex mental phenomena such as "delusions". In a passage from the essay "The Natural and Acquired Characters of the Human Soul" (1815), Fourier explains "the existence and permanence of the soul in the animal species, through the medium of some undeterminate number of germs, of which the animal does not perceive and of which he can never, or nearly never, have any notion but which can nevertheless influence his movements in a manner similar to thought."[4]</p><br><p>The French monist Alfred Maury had a more optimistic vision of human nature, in which "the soul is a real, active principle, as it is one of the great organs of the body, of the same order with other organs which act mechanically to control the body" (Maury's description is not entirely accurate\xe2\x80\x94there are more complex mechanisms involved. See Dennett's discussion of this question).</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
