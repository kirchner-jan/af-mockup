My initial impression was that, sure, the vast majority of people could improve their productivity if they just thought about it. But given that we already know all this, it must be for something else.</p><br><p>And as I thought about it, I realized that it has something to do with IQ. That is, the most successful people in the U.S. are disproportionately well-educated, and people with higher IQ tend to be more successful. But why is that, in turn?</p><br><p>IQ <em>has</em> something to do with your personal productivity. Studies find that people who score higher IQ have higher SAT scores, even after controlling for SAT scores. So if you have lower SAT scores, if it seems to you like you can't score high without getting SAT scores higher, then you're wrong.</p><br><p>But a lot of the most successful people don't come to college straight out of high school. For example, Bill Gates didn't. He studied physics, chemistry, and biology at Harvard and then took the LSAT (legal studies administration test) so he could study law at Stanford. He then took another law school exam, passed, and eventually got a PhD in computer science at Stanford.</p><br><p>So I agree we have a _general _relationship between intelligence and personal productivity. IQ _tests _your productivity. But IQ tests also help _prevent _you from becoming a less productive individual. They let you avoid spending time and energy on things that will help only in a small number of cases. Thus, even though the correlation between IQ and your personal productivity is real, it's hard to say how high that correlation is. I doubt it is the whole story by any means, since as with many things in life you have to have some innate ability beyond just IQ to excel.</p><br><p>Still, the correlation suggests one important question: What are the best places to go to become better educated within a reasonable time frame?</p><br><p>As in most life questions, my instinctive answer was "school," but that quickly ran into a big problem: Even if you wanted the best education you could get, what do you do when you graduate? Where do you go from there to improve your productivity? Is "college" even a coherent term here? What do you really want?</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>So how about trade schools? Is that a viable option these days? The National Association of Realtors website seems to say yes and so does this blog post.</p><br><p>Let me set a few terms first. I'll use "college" to mean an undergraduate degree, with a focus on undergrad degrees from liberal arts schools. I'll call someone who gets out of college with three years of non-degree work the "pre-professional stage" and someone who gets out with six years after graduating an "ex-pre-professional stage". Then I'd call myself an "ex-post-professional".</p><br><p>A trade school is a place where students take in-demand college-level classes. They often have much lower admission standards than colleges, so you can get in if you haven't attended any other institutions. And they give you a certificate of completion, which you can use to get jobs in the relevant field you want to go into.</p><br><p>An example: There's a very competitive and very good-paying job as an autobody technician. The job requires a high school diploma and some previous experience with heavy machinery, but to get the job you just need to get a certificate in autobody work from anywhere that will let you into the school. In fact, it works vice-versa: if you have a certificate, they'll even let you in to college with not much more coursework. Or maybe not even any coursework: the only prerequisite is that you've passed both some sort of test in heavy vehicles and demonstrated some of the skills taught in heavy vehicles driving school\xe2\x80\x94an expensive test, I know, but better than nothing and cheaper than a real college.</p><br><p>Another example: There are three levels\xe2\x80\x94pre-professional, ex-pre-professional, and ex-post-professional\xe2\x80\x94of occupational and professional licensing. In the U.S, you can get a certificate from your high school teaching and social skills, or by getting a bachelor's degree from a non-teaching school, or, most controversially, by getting a two-year degree in a field where there's no requirement for a certificate.</p><br><p>If you want to get into college, the pre-pre-pre-professionals might be the best way to do it. What about the ex-pre-professions?</p><br><p><strong>III.</strong></p><br><p><strong>Is it an option to get a trade certificate with little if any actual work?</strong></p><br><p>Yes. Some states issue CNA certificates without qualifying, as does a tiny county in the Philippines (population ~180k). Yes, there are also some pre-pre-proferences who've gone into this without any college, but these seem to be rare.</p><br><p><strong>Is a certificate comparable to a degree?</strong></p><br><p>Well, sort of. It can get you certain jobs and certifications, but it is mostly not a degree. It can't count on your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 to get to your dream job or even get you interviews.</p><br><p>And is there significant selection bias or quality control in how these places are set up?</p><br><p>I don't know, but I'd be interested in seeing some evidence of it. For example, if I was interested in autobody then I could look up places near Los Angeles and see what they're like. And I would be interested to see how often and how well people from non-college backgrounds end up with certificates, versus those who finish school with more traditional education. These questions are too hard to do on my own, but I'd love to have more evidence from people who have looked into this themselves.</p><br><p><strong>How do you evaluate the "trade certificates"?</strong></p><br><p>First of all, the certificates are _very _easy to fake. One place in San Diego had a certificate in social skills, so I asked a friend for one and he had to take a class in social skills at a local private school before getting it. So I decided to take the easy way out and just get an autobody certificate instead.</p><br><p>For the best trade certificates, I suspect that the only qualifications you need to have are an ACT score of 20-26 or more and either a grade-average of 3.5 to 4.0 or (this is the really hard part!) having a GPA that meets a threshold set by the field and the school. Or you have to have taken their driver's training classes and earned an "L" or "S" on your license and have had your license for 5 years. But that just goes to say how stringent you'd have to be in order to get into the program in the first place.</p><br><p>I am curious if other people have tried to look into this.</p><br><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><br><p>Let's say you really do want to get into one of these ex-pre-preferences. How do you know if it's worth it? Or, more to the point, how do you know if you're doing something to "level up" your credentials or just going through the same credentialing motions that "people" are always doing? My instinctive inclination was to say "well I've never had a college degree so that's no use to me, and in any case <em>you</em> know it's the best thing to do." I'm wondering how much of that intuition is just signaling with one's college degree being a costly signal of a better signal in the form of credentials?</p><br><p><strong>V.</strong></p><br><p>Okay, so a college education is clearly "better than nothing" under this view, and "ex-prepref" under some of the trade school terms. So what comes next? Is there some kind of a "best trade school around" that you can get into? Where you don't have to do any hard work beyond the requirements listed above?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
