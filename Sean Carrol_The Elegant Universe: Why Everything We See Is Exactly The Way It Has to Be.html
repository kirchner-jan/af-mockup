They are listed roughly in order of how much work has gone into them, but not listed in the order in which I read about them.</p><br><p>The standard physics textbook begins with general relativity, and then shows how to derive it starting from Newtonian mechanics. But I was shocked to find that the answer, when I asked an expert, was that no <em>one</em> has explained <em>general</em> relativity starting from Newtonian gravity. Maybe there isn't much to explain, after all.</p><br><p>Then I came across string theory, which started by giving a different solution to the problem of particles moving at different speeds\xe2\x80\x94it was a new particle for every different momentum, but the particle could be in more than one place at the same time. But this new theory had its own problems. If string theory <em>actually were</em> the solution to the problem you could never see it (it's supposed to be a quantum field, but it only lives in one dimension).</p><br><p>Then came loop quantum gravity. Again, a whole new theory for a simple old problem:  There are regions of space <em>at the same time, but you can only interact with them if you jump over a space</em>.</p><br><p>And then came a different way of looking at string theory. Maybe spacetime itself was made of an infinite network of connected parts\xe2\x80\x94a string network. The problem is still with the infinite number of strings, and the fact that there's no way we can look at the "size" of a string because things can be in infinite number of places at the same time, and it's possible to have things on "the other side" of an infinite space. But the size of the parts of the network could be finite. This would allow us to see the "size" "of an infinite" universe, which is another thing no one has succeeded in doing.</p><br><p>Finally, the elegant theory. The theory was invented to solve the problem that we see the universe to be spatially finite, but time-infinitely large. We've _already _seen that the universe is spatially infinite, and time-infinitely long, which seems suspiciously like what you'd expect an eternal universe to look like.</p><br><p>This got me thinking. Suppose that when string theory and loop quantum gravity were developed, it just wasn't clear what they were <em>trying</em> to do\xe2\x80\x94the theorists didn't have enough understanding of the problem to know that that was even possible, let alone how to proceed. And imagine also that many physicists were just using the same kinds of arguments that they do nowadays to defend their existing conclusions.</p><br><p>So I imagined two worlds; either the universe isn't spatially infinite, but then at the same time the physicists who first discovered general relativity, or whoever, might've thought that Newtonian physics would still suffice in describing the universe\xe2\x80\x94I think they had no idea of the infinite time at which Newtonian physics was valid; or the physicists did know about space being spatially infinite, it just took centuries to develop the theory of general relativity with these properties in mind.</p><br><p>So maybe in our own world we're in the second world, and things are actually much worse. We only realize now that general relativity is a key component of the story, but <em>general</em> relativity was the key component of the theory that was _first _developed in the world with time-limited physics, not the new, generalizable theory which was _designed _from scratch to work with space-finite physics.</p><br><p>This is important for our current understanding of physics, because (1) it means that no one knows how an infinite universe would function, and (2) we have no evidence that our world is in the first world. I suspect that the true physical laws are in fact in the first world, but also that this evidence (and even the knowledge) exists but was just missing until a few people realized the general problem.</p><br><p>If you're interested in what led to this realization, the best place to start is the work of cosmologist Brandon Carter, who noticed that general relativity and cosmology seemed to point in the direction of the infinite universe. The first book-length account I found is this one; I haven't read it, but have followed Carter's work for a long time since he wrote it (and it turned out in retrospect that he was on the right track with his intuitions long before he could articulate them).  My understanding of Carter's work is that his insights are not just "intuitively obvious", but that they are forced by the mathematical consistency of the physical world, and have not been independently discovered.</p><br><p>I think Carter is partly correct about why the infinite universe is consistent, but that it's also a <em>mistake</em> to <em>assume</em> that there isn't anything in the infinite universe that can <em>distinguish between</em> our world and the first world. But I'm not qualified to discuss infinity in a vacuum; you may have to listen to a physicist to learn how that stuff works. I'd be happy to chat about related topics and answer questions in the comments!</p><br><p>Finally, there are some speculations on the physics of this world, which might also be of interest to anyone in the general audience. Some of these hypotheses are quite speculative, but in the context of our current theory, they make empirical predictions that we can check through observation.</p><br><p><strong><em>Hypothesis 1:</em></strong> Our universe is infinite space-time in <em>both</em> directions, not just one.</p><br><p>Suppose that our universe is infinite along the "time" dimension, and that there are a finite number of other dimensions (e.g., that our universe occupies space only along one dimension that's parallel with time).  Then any given location in our universe can be "connected" in time to many other locations, but never in space. So the shape of our universe looks roughly like a three-dimensional ball (think a giant, spinning three-sphere) at the moment of "singularity"; if any of the balls in the ball-structure were to get a little bit smaller, that part of the ball-stucture would disappear into existence, and then the ball-stuction as a whole would get smaller, so that all of the balls in "time" were to a first approximation independent from each other.</p><br><p>The <em>further</em> thing that makes this hypothesis true is that (a) this is what we expect from a dynamical universe, where the law governing the expansion of the universe creates space out of nothing, and (b) <em>within</em> a sufficiently large universe, the space-time can't disappear into nothing, because it has to appear somewhere for the universe to expand.</p><br><p>We can <em>also</em> speculate on the form of the other two-dimensional subspaces of the physics-balls that are the other six "other directions," but <em>given the above</em>, this is less speculative. The two "extra" dimensions are likely to follow the time dimension, just as the three in the original case.</p><br><p>This hypothesis is testable: the universe at the present moment seems to be expanding, so we should expect that expansion will continue to accelerate; the rate of acceleration would be approximately constant, but if we knew how much it was accelerating, we could tell that we're <em>very</em> far from any of the other locations in our universe that matter is hitting, and that this is indeed a uniformly accelerating expansion. It's <em>not</em> an expansion that will "level off" at some finite speed, but will continue in the same pattern of growth forever. So we shouldn't <em>expect</em> to be able to use stars as "anchor points" to establish the times when matter on Earth got to the other parts of the universe, let alone the <em>exact</em> distance.</p><br><p>The hypothesis is also falsifiable by our measurement accuracy\xe2\x80\x94any inaccuracy in our measurement could be consistent with the other hypothesis.</p><br><p><strong><em>Proposal 1a:</em></strong> If the observable universe <em>really were</em> finite-dimensional at the most fundamental level, then we wouldn't <em>actually</em> be able to do precision measurements that establish the expansion of the (finite) observable universe.</p><br><p>Because the observed universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, we can <em>accurately</em> point to the present-day observable universe (from the point of view of the cosmic microwave background) as the Big Bang (from the point view of the local stars).  So we could potentially establish the expansion of our observed universe from the expansion of the Big Bang if we knew the present-day shape of the universe, and the evolution of the universe from that event through the present day.</p><br><p>However, a measurement at the present day that would accurately pin down the expansion of our universe to today, would by necessity involve <em>detecting, at the present day,</em> the expansion of the future in every direction, i.e., detecting the effects of the expansion of the whole universe through our universe. This would require superluminal communication!</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
