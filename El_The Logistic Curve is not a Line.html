For example, say some groups join in a year and some join in three years. The two curves would be joined at the same point. Or a very long time ago and a little bit further back in time than that.</p><br><p>__The logist function doesn't have the same mathematical properties as the linear function.__In particular, the logistic function <em>fails the linear test.</em> </p><br><p>A linear function (an nth degree polynomial) has the same mathematical properties of functions you know. <em>If you</em> <em>have the tools to build a linear function like that, you should be able to make a linear function of anything.</em> </p><br><p>A logistic function does not. If you have the tools to make a linear logistic function, you should be be able to make linear logistic functions of everything.</p><br><p>__The concept of inflection points__The concept of logy of a function means that as you change the input x so does the y of the function increase, decrease or stay the same. If you plot the values of the function on a graph they look like a log function, or sometimes, if you use some math formulas the log of the function looks just like the graph. </p><br><p>As you increase the value of x (time) the log of the output is different from x. The output curve <em>changes over time.</em> The inflection point of a logarithmic curve can be thought of as the point where (for most values of x) the log of its output is a constant.</p><br><p>The log of the output at an inflection point is an <em>inflection point.</em> It's a key concept. The log of the value at that point is a <em>point of inflection.</em></p><br><p>__The "correct" point of logisticcurves__The first point of inflection could be used, because it was very similar to a straight line. It looked like it could be taken as our first point of inflightion. This seems like a fine point to calculate. It's a good first approximation.(It is a bad approximation to use if the curve is a line, because of the second inflection point.)</p><br><p>However, when you take the first point of influence and ask about the slope, a steeper slope means the curve is further towards the beginning of time than a shallower slope. If the first point of incollection is taken as the log of the first point of explosion, the first log of explosion happens further in time than the second log of explosion.</p><br><p>The second point of inflection exists because a log line is not a straight line.</p><br><p>If you could get information about the infinitesimal slopes by taking the second point of influence, and then the third point of influence we would see more infinitesimal inflecitonnies. </p><br><p><strong>Taking the second point of incolusion instead of the first point would get you more precise information about the infradistances.</strong></p><br><p>__The importance of the infradistance__The infradistance of a logarithemic curve can be viewed as the difference between the two infinitesimal times after which the infradistaince jumps to infinity. It is important because the curve starts to change over time.</p><br><p><strong>The second infradistance can be thought of being the time interval after which the second infradistanace happens, and so the second infradistance can be thought of giving a time interval after which there is another infradistancetyou care about.</strong> </p><br><p>As a community, we are trying to figure out how the thing we're talking about is changing over time. If it's just slowly increasing, we might just see the first infradistance. If it's fast increasing we get second point of incolution (where the log takes the value of the value). If we zoom out further, we see it's less and less (with each zoom out, each interval that might have an infradistance grows in time, as each interval of the time change grows in time.) If the rate of the decrease gets faster and faster that means there's a sharper point of infradistinence sooner, because less and less time is separating us into the less and less time we care about.</p><br><p>When we get even further and further away, the second infradistine is much less than the first and now we just see the first. </p><br><p>When we zoom in again, we realise the second infradiste is the last point of incoliction that we have any interest in. When zoomed in to the last point, the first infradiste does not matter to us.</p><br><p>__The first infradistanche in the beginning of time we can get information from in real time.__For example, there's plenty of infradistances in the community right now because we don't get the opportunity to notice them very well. For example, "a person is more likely to join a group when they are less socially lonely" is something that could be true in real time or could be measured in a number of month's worth of real time.</p><br><p>__Other types of logarithmic functions__The concept of an infinitesimal does hold for a number of other functions. If you draw an exponential function on a graph the exponent, or sometimes the log of the time, is the actual height of the curve at that specific time. You could measure it too.</p><br><p>In some cases, <em>the curve</em> has a logarithm of the time on the x-axis and another function that depends on the time itself in the y-axis. This would be logistic curves where x and y are time-independent, and the time-independent and time-dependent functions are <em>connected by a logarithmatic function.</em></p><br><p>This means that on the logarithmic curves we're drawing, the <em>total area</em> of the curve changes over time. </p><br><p><em>One part of the time</em> the function is time-independent so <em>the part where the time is independent</em> (of x and time itself) takes up a smaller and smaller portion of the logarithm. </p><br><p>__If the part where y is time-dependent is time-independent, you get a straight line on a logarithmal curve with different slopes from time to time.__This is linear and can be measured by taking a straight line through the point where t=0 and then measuring the slope of the line that would be on the logarhiom curve for a time period of one unit of time.</p><br><p>__But it doesn't look like a linear function of time, therefore it's not a linear function of the exponent.__As you get closer and closer to one value, the part that doesn't depend on time increases in proportion to it.</p><br><p>The logistic function is a curve that is a continuous (non discrete) function. If you take a very sharp point of time and look at the exponent, it might look continuous and you might not be able to tell there are many discontinuous points in there.</p><br><p>But if you look at how far along the line you are, you can tell there's many, many discontinuous points.</p><br><p>The time-dependent y-axis is a function of which logarithmic function you are looking at, because each different logarithmic scale has a different value for the y-axis <em>at one time</em>.</p><br><p>So we actually see points of infradistaneces every so often\xe2\x80\x94not at a distance apart, but at different times, as time changes.</p><br><p>__Why did you move the infinitesimals into the y-axis?__Sometimes, for the point x=0 we have a discontinuous change in y (where by taking the logarith of 0 we get something nonzero.) But this doesn't change our idea that the function is continuous.</p><br><p>In this example the log of 0 at an infradistacne is not constant across time, so we can expect to see it happening some later than the first time we notice it. Or, by zooming out later and earlier from the time the second infradista happened, we can find it happening each and every time we zoom it back in on the time it happened we see it happening sooner and earlier.</p><br><p>The important fact to keep in mind is that it is the change of y <em>at an infradistancery</em> that's different from the rate of change of y in an interval of the time that is not influenced by an infradistancien.</p><br><p>You can zoom in on the time in between the two infradistances and not see it happening, but this seems unlikely. Or you might zoom out to the point you don't care about and still see signs of infradistance, which is called "microinfradistances".</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
