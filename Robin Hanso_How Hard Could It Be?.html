These intuitive methods tend to be quite poor, especially when it comes to tasks where the human effort and output are both costly (e.g. hiring a person) or where the machine isn't capable of the task at all (e.g., designing a car).</p><br><p>One key question for estimating the difficulty of a cognitive task is how similar it is to other cognitive tasks we are familiar with. If we compare the difficulty of some task to the difficulty of other tasks that have been studied a lot within and between communities, we can predict both the similarity of the tasks (how hard they are relative to other tasks) and the difficulties relative to other tasks (how hard it is to estimate the difficulty for a task given that we already know how hard other tasks are). But while there is some evidence that it is very difficult to predict task difficulty from task similarity, the relationship is far from robust (see also the first page of the Wikipedia search on difficulty).</p><br><p>Yet a lot of what we think of as task difficulty also depends on what we mean by 'task'. To see how this can have an effect on apparent task difficulty, let's first consider what economists usually mean by task. The simplest economists view a specific task as a set of skills which can be broken down into several basic sub-skills, and then attempt to assess how similar or dissimilar the skills and tasks are. One way to do this is to compare the average performance, on the skills, of one task at any given level of skill, to another task using similar skills at that level. If the skills are similar for both tasks, we would expect the performance on the skill at that level would be similar. If the tasks are similar and the skills are dissimilar, we would expect similar performance for both tasks on the skill at the dissimilar level. To assess similarities, we must also compare the performance of the tasks at that skill level to the performance of the skill level of some similar skill. Economists call the difference between the performance of the task in the skill of our interest and the performance of similar skill the <strong>market value of the task</strong>. We can then use the market value, along with the skill level in question, as inputs into a formula called the <strong>product</strong>, which is a function that outputs how much time or effort needs to be directed into some task in order to bring the output/\xe2\x80\x8bcost up to the market value level. Another function is the <strong>return on investment</strong>, which is the amount of time or effort that is enough. For any task that we care to compare to some similar task, there is an input (the market price) and an output (the return on investment), and we can plot the function for the current task and for the comparable task to obtain the difficulty of the task relative to the comparable task.</p><br><p>Note that the market and return on investment functions are both normalized to yield an output between zero (no output) and one (market value or return on investment). In the example plots below, I have also included the return on investment to indicate, visually, how big of a difference is between the two outputs.</p><br><p>To see how the market and return functions can vary among tasks, let's first analyze how much work people actually do on the most important tasks in society, those of highest importance in the national economy. The top 40 tasks (from the Bureau of Labor Statistics \xe2\x80\x93 http://\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwww.bls.hfjbl.rwth-aachen.de/\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b) are in the top 4.6% in terms of national import, which also means the most valuable imports to the United States. This means they represent the highest value tasks for the United States, so we'd expect them to be the work of people at the top in the economy in terms of how valuable they are in terms of money. For the next level down, we have the top 100 (20% of imports) and the next 500, and so on.</p><br><p>What would these tasks look like if they were used for assessing task difficulty? I've used the data from the most valuable tasks in order to produce a sample of these tasks, below. Note that a task is typically used for several different purposes in each industry, and the task may be more or less valuable in some other industry, or the task is more or less valuable relative to some other tasks in that industry. If that were the case, we would expect to see more than 100 tasks for each of the most important tasks.</p><br><p>__1. __The market value inputs for these four most valuable tasks tend to lie in the bottom right:</p><br><p>__2. __The market values for these four most important tasks have all increased since 1965, so it looks like increasing productivity has increased the market values substantially even while costs have become more and more modest \xe2\x80\x93 although costs are also rising somewhat for the other high value tasks, so the effect could be somewhat offsetting.</p><br><p>__3. __The return and market values look like they vary, depending almost entirely on the industry sector:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p>High-skilled technical sectors (computer programming, design), which have very little variation in the market values and relatively high variation in the returns (although the returns overall seem to be getting cheaper, even on average). These sectors tend to have labor market prices as a percent of income, from less than 30% to over 80%.</p><br><ul>
<li>\t</li>
</ul><br><p>In the high-skilled technical sectors that are dominated by computers, some sectors have seen very little change in the market values, and have seen large increases in return (e.g, oil prices are a tenth of what they were ~10 years ago). On the other hand, the computer industry has seen both a large increase in market values, and an increase in return. In fact, market values seem to be rising so much for computer jobs that they seem to be on the edge of market saturation, but not even remotely close to approaching it.</p><br><ul>
<li>
<hr />
</li>
</ul><br><p>In the more abstract, soft, human or social labor market sectors, market values have fallen. Even though the returns on investment were generally fairly high, there appears to have been no particular reason to expect them to rise, and they did not. Even more dramatically, there have been few large increases in market values, especially relative to the returns in those sectors.</p><br><ul>
<li>The bottom left sector is manufacturing (excluding agriculture); the return and market values have fallen by a factor of 10 since the late 1960s.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>These are sectors that I know little about (as best I can tell there is no public data about them), but there it seems the return and market have actually dropped quite dramatically on average.</li>
</ul><br><p>From this, it seems like the more important tasks we think of as 'high-skill' have seen some increase in productivity. It also seems like there is a substantial amount of work to do for increasing these tasks, but this is more difficult than increasing the productivity of other tasks, and progress has been less impressive. So the idea that high-skill tasks are becoming more easy to do should probably be qualified. On the other hand the less important tasks of the high skilled technical sectors that have seen some increases in productivity have seen decreases in market values and return on investment while the more important tasks that have seen decreases in productivity have seen increases in market values and even higher returns.</p><br><p>So a better way to estimate the difficulty is to study how much work people are actually putting into tasks, as compared to the market prices we see for tasks. I've already seen one work done on this question, in a study of the impact of academic credentialist hiring on output (I'm in the process of collecting more data on the methodology for this study, so the study will not be part of the next summary). This study finds that workers are giving one to four times as much work effort to tasks relative to the market value of tasks when comparing workers of the same skill level in the same job, but they still mostly focus their work on tasks for which they are well-paid. So for example, a study using BLS data find that computer programming is a $300,000/\xe2\x80\x8byear job, but in comparison to the market value, it is judged to have taken on $18,000's worth of work effort (3-4<em>$300,000 \xe2\x88\x92 $18,000</em>$300,0000/\xe2\x80\x8byear). The BLS data also show a very uneven distribution of work effort from lower skilled workers to upper skilled workers, with the very highest skilled workers putting more work effort into high skill tasks. These two things suggest that people do somewhat more work effort into tasks, but that there are some jobs in which these efforts dominate the market price over all workers.</p><br><p>For more on the extent and causes of credentialism, see also the previous summary and the paper referenced there.</p><br><p>__4. __The second-most important tasks look even less similar to the most important tasks, and they don't look like they are highly valued by most people working in them. So if we interpret market price as a fairly fair measure of task difficulty under the standard assumptions about markets, we should expect that it is a poorer measure of task difficulty for the second-most valuable tasks than for the more valuable tasks.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
