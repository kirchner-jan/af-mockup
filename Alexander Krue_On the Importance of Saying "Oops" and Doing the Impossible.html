<p>I know why I am trying to write this essay, and this essay is not going to be easy. It is not going to work.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>One day of my life was wasted, and my other days were miserable with uncertainty."</p><br><p><em>\xe2\x80\x93 _The Book of Five Rings</em> by Gene Wolfe</p><br><p>As I alluded to in Against Saying Ooops and Doing the Impossible, one of the major challenges in life is keeping a grip on yourself, and making yourself get ahead of yourself. This is no easy task. And yet it is one that human beings are built for. The most dangerous situation our species has ever faced, the time when we are most likely to fall for a trap is when we are in the process of falling for that trap, as if our brains couldn't wait to jump into the pit. We live in a world where most of the dangers in our lives happen by accident or by design. We live in an age full of traps that we're not prepared for, if we aren't on the look-out for them ourselves, or don't have a clever way to avoid them.</p><br><p>And yet most of us have a tendency and inclination towards taking heroic responsibility for all of our misfortunes, and our triumphs. We want to feel like heroes, and heroes need to feel like the world would also do well without them or at least is greatly improved for their heroic existence. We all too often feel as though we are not only in control of our own lives, but in control of the universe too.</p><br><p>It helps that most of us have little sympathy of the "just-world hypothesis" in which the laws of Nature are such that most of the times, we are completely and precisely justified in assuming that if something is in a universe with an equal number of white or black swans or fair coin flips, it's probably going to be in that universe too. This is a wonderful excuse to take it easy on ourselves and not worry about how to explain why the good things happen to us or why the bad things happen to us.</p><br><p>But that's also a dangerous way of looking at the world. I am not saying that we should turn around and become nihilists with nothing to strive for. On the contrary, I am saying that we need to be able to accept the truth that the majority of the time, we are most probably right to assume that if something happens to us, it's going to happen again. Otherwise we risk jumping to the conclusion that there's nothing we can do about it, and then doing <em>nothing about it</em> or at least letting it <em>fail to happen</em> by taking on the burden of responsibility to do anything about it.</p><br><p>My mother used to joke to me that one definition of a computer hacker is a person who is too incompetent to understand programming and too narcissistic to understand other people. We all too frequently think that <em>I am</em> the one who is incompetent and too narcissistic in relation to the things and situations in my life that matter most to me. Of course, this is an absurd mistake, and I should not let my confidence in its absurdity blind me in accepting its truth.</p><br><p>In fact, it's a major benefit, for me, in knowing when I know that something is a trap, to be less arrogant and to step back and ask, "Where is that trap?" or "What if?" or "What do the facts say?" The trap is almost always a mistake <em>my</em> brain has made, and my job is to try to repair it.</p><br><p>And if that seems too easy, then that means I'm working hard enough to not have gotten sucked into the trap in the first place. I'm not going to pretend that working on this problem is easy, but I am going to say it is within my reach. In short it is my duty as a rational being that I be able to admit when I've gotten sucked into a trap or a mistake. There is no <em>justification</em> for not being able to admit defeat and admit that my attempts to do better have failed.</p><br><p>But there are more important considerations. Let's start with this question. What is the <em>most important</em> thing in the world, the thing that is going to make a huge difference to your life? What would the world be very different if you found it out that the answer was one thing, or if the answer was another? The answer to this question is going to change <em>your</em> life if you decide that it's going to be different from what you currently think it is. This is one of those questions where some amount of humility is necessary. Don't just take the answer that will make your life easy. Take the answer that can be yours too.</p><br><p>What is the <em>second most important</em> thing? How about the <em>third</em> most important? And so on. Let's face it. There are very few things in the world that would make a huge difference in how you live your life, let alone how you live the life of the whole world. I think most of us, if we had to name one, would choose <em>truthfulness</em>. I do. I think that is the number one thing that makes the biggest difference in how well things go for you in life. I think that finding out about truthfulness could make the biggest difference in the progress of humanity. And I think that we all too often fail to live lives that are grounded in truthfulness.</p><br><p>I'm not being too general. I don't want this to sound like a generalization, but rather that I have some specific beliefs about what the most important thing in the world is, and that those beliefs are true as far as they go about the world. I hope this is one of the things everyone reading this post would agree is one of the most important things in the world.</p><br><p>Let's try a few examples of truthfulness.</p><br><blockquote>
<p>What is your true and honest opinion of the fact that the Nazis killed millions of Gypsies and Jews during World War II?</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This is a real question. I've got my opinion and I know that a lot of you have differing opinions. But at least by asking that question we're engaging in truthfulness. What you think of this particular fact is not going to impact our ability to have a productive relationship, or our ability to have mutual respect or trust.</p><br><p>But I'm going to ask this question because I want to get into truthfulness, as it's the answer to this question that is going to have the greatest effect on my life.</p><br><p>I hope you'll admit, however, that if you're going to have a productive and trusting relationship with me, if you're going in search of truth and not in search of an argument, then you need to be honest with <em>me</em>. So, I asked you what you thought of the truth, and even though you're not sure, you gave an honest answer. And I said it's the most important thing that makes our lives go better, so what is the truth in this situation?</p><br><p>For me, what's really going on here is that I'm not <em>going to</em> <em>lie</em>. I'm also not going to <em>tell you</em> that the truth is one thing when in reality the truth is another. It's the same truth. It's just that my opinion of it has shifted a little bit.</p><br><p>There are some important exceptions. A lot of times there is no way to express what you think without lying. Sometimes I'll honestly say something that I know to be not true, out of fear that I'll look bad if I don't admit my mistake. And in those instances, I think we can talk the issue out and work out a compromise that satisfies both of us. And that's good too. But this is not the exception. I think that when it comes to honesty I am going to stick to the truth and not compromise for the sake of being a cooperative person.</p><br><p>But, having said that, I'll acknowledge there is a certain amount of "truth" that I don't have to lie about. I can avoid saying "the Nazis killed millions of Jews and Gypsies during world war II\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2 because it's technically a lie. It's not a false statement, so it doesn't break the truth-seeking habit I'm developing.</p><br><p>That having been said, I honestly believe I'm still going to be honest with you about that fact. As I said, it's going it make or break our relationship of trust and relationship of productivity.</p><br><p>Which is why I think that "the Nazis killed <em>millions</em> of Gypsies" was such a poor example of truthfulness that I was compelled to ask the question.</p><br><p>One of the most important thing you learn when doing philosophy is that questions are really useful\xe2\x80\x94you shouldn't stop at "What is truth?" because you've done something useful with the question "What is truth?".</p><br><p>Truthfulness is a way of looking at how people react to things in the world around them, in terms of what they believe\xe2\x80\x94in other words it's a way of examining behavior. So it could be a valuable way to examine how other people do things in the world in order to understand that world better.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
