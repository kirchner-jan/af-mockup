</ul><br><p><strong>The FDA Delenda Est Sequence, Part 2:</strong> FDA Delenda Est: The Evidence</p><br><p>The first part of this sequence is here, which looks at why the FDA was the way it was, how the FDA could have been done better, and what we can do about it as a society.</p><br><p>One more thing. A number of people have asked about the data from the original FDA advisory panel on Covid-19. They did a study of that data, and did not reproduce the results, but I did find the raw data.</p><br><p>I looked through it, and the best possible headline is that the data is ambiguous. Not ambiguous like 'yes there's a problem and here's a bunch of data to do with that problem.' But rather, <em>ambiguous _data. The thing I want us to know for sure is, _has there been an actual pandemic before Covid?</em> What we're observing and inferring from this data set is the first thing we do, the <em>very first thing.</em> One way to figure that out is to run the numbers with the same test we used when we had Covid.</p><br><p>There is also the question of _if we are seeing signs of a pandemic, _should the FDA take those signs into consideration? It's not fully in and of itself bad news.</p><br><p>If you look closely, you can see that the FDA did take that data into consideration. You can also see that that first question _does not seem to have been considered or answered. _The CDC is saying a lot of different things, and the FDA is at the same time saying different things in turn. Which of those is the _real FDA? _These things seem like two very different things from the perspective of anyone who's thought about this at all. So we have this thing that we're trying to figure out, and that's not going to happen, at least not here.</p><br><p>Thus I find my head spinning more and more, wondering if we're even looking in the right places.</p><br><p>The problem is that the best approach to deciding whether we should do something, based on such ambiguous data, is not to figure out what the data mean, but rather to _think carefully about what the data mean _so we can make a judgement that is informed by our models and that also takes into account all those competing priorities.</p><br><p>That doesn't mean _we should immediately accept that the FDA has the whole answer. _It does mean that we cannot assume and must look carefully to figure out what exactly is going on in the data.</p><br><p>The Model </p><br><p>A friend, after writing his model of Covid-19 under the assumption that _the CDC's models _were correct, noted that they had some things wrong. He asked me to check this, and I checked their CDC models. The headline numbers were correct. But the results when you run the numbers to get deaths, hospitalizations and infections were all different than when one looks at the raw data. That's important. It invalidates a lot of their predictions.</p><br><p>On the other hand, the FDA, which also has things wrong with their models, is doing a number that are _directly opposite the model that is making their predictions. _If you compare their model to their predictions, the results mostly don't line up at all. Either what the FDA wants you to see doesn't exist, or they somehow manage to get the numbers to line up, although this seems unlikely, or...</p><br><p>It can't be that the FDA actually believes their model is more accurate than the CDC's model. They'd have no problem correcting their model to match their model's predictions.</p><br><p>The FDA can't be that they <em>think their model is the one that should win the argument.</em></p><br><p>It's that there isn't a clear winner. There are only several plausible ways to generate these numbers, and to most people, the FDA's model is the model worth most credence.</p><br><p>To many, if someone who runs the numbers says the FDA's model has a better model that says the model that the FDA's model comes out on top, the FDA's numbers must have a bug. The FDA's people will tell us they don't have any bugs. Then we have no choice but to believe them (unless we can see the bug ourselves in the numbers).</p><br><p>That's my read, and it's not a perfect read.</p><br><p>This situation, where everyone believes the FDA's numbers should win the argument, is a key example of the planning fallacy, which is often not about good outcomes but rather about winning arguments. There's a clear _reason _that the FDA believes its numbers should win such arguments, but that's a very different thing from _thinking their numbers are good _because they expect them to win.</p><br><p>Once one realizes that everyone in the room knows that the FDA people's numbers are more accurate, the rest of what's going on becomes clear.</p><br><p>The Numbers</p><br><p>A key underlying principle from my previous posts is that when there's tons of ambiguity, you have to start by looking directly at the data and seeing what is going on with it, especially to understand whether such ambiguity is an anomaly, an error that we should expect to be resolved, or whether something real is going on. It requires doing math, but not very advanced math, and it looks at most like calculating expected values. It's the same as figuring out whether the FDA was predicting anything remotely realistic about Covid-19 and then seeing whether the numbers make more sense.</p><br><p>There's nothing ambiguous about what the FDA was saying. They were saying they expect to see _more Covid-19 _than we actually are seeing. But they _also _said there are _fewer Covid-19 deaths. _What do these numbers mean?</p><br><p>Thus, in order to interpret the FDA's model, and how confident one should be in their conclusion, one must ask the questions of:</p><br><ul>
<li>What was the base rate of Covid-like illnesses prior to Covid-19?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What was the true base rate of Covad-19?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How likely are Covid-19 infections 'detected' by the FDA data versus others being actually infected?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How does Covid death rate in the general population change over time versus what we see in the FDA data?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What kind of effect does the CFR being higher than the raw reported CFR have on the actual Covid death counts?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>What effect does the CFR's lower in the FDA data versus other data have on reported Covid counts?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How sensitive is our test versus what's being reported?</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>How often do people not have any symptoms, but have Covad-19 infection?</li>
</ul><br><p>If we look at the raw data, there are no signs of the FDA _modeling these effects at all. _They're instead being used to argue _against _them.</p><br><p>Thus, my model is that they're taking the result of their model in their model, adding them up to a total, and seeing which result they can best argue for or against.</p><br><p>Then they're picking that model and trying to argue that it makes sense on the basis of _that's how you do pandemic modeling. _There's never a good reason to run an experiment and there's no reason to use that experiment to compare what could plausibly happen if a drug doesn't have a very high safety record. But when you have ambiguous data, you model it as best you can, then throw it away to make predictions about the world.</p><br><p>They want us to think that their model is correct, and also think that if people believe their model is correct the arguments _must _line up. As opposed to them modeling the world so as to match their data, but making predictions that don't line up for reasons their model doesn't care about when it doesn't _really _have high confidence, or even have a model.</p><br><p>The question then is, how do we reconcile this with the headline they've been _telling everyone for weeks _that they've been _correctly anticipating _Covid-19 for months?</p><br><p>The Hypothesis</p><br><p>One hypothesis is that this is all the FDA's data. They have zero Covid-19 cases. They have zero deaths, including those from previous Covid-19 outbreaks. And that's why they're _correct _to say there are few Covid-19 illnesses. Even if there were a few, they wouldn't be detected, because there's no deaths. If you look at what the model predicts about these things, it says there are no Covid-19 people.</p><br><p>Thus that's what the raw data says. If you trust the FDA's numbers, how can you have'so few Covid-related deaths' since they claim they don't have a single Covid-19 case to count as a death?</p><br><p>My answer is that the FDA _does not believe that their model is right _when it is _correctly predicting things. _They think their model of the world would be _wrong _if that model predicted people had Covid-19 that they didn't. Thus they get to pick _any _result they want out of their model that doesn't directly contradict the model that's right. They get to say 'the model says there are only so many of these' and then they decide, 'Oops, actually, no, it says zero,' but they'll defend it anyway.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
