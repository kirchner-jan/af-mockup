Covid-19 isn't the world's worst emergency, and that's a terrible sign.</p><br><p>Covid-19 is obviously not a threat to the world but it is a threat to your community. It will affect how you see yourself. It will affect people you care about, or have cared about.</p><br><p>You live in a physical world that is still somewhat functional, and physical restrictions will not go away any time soon or any matter of personal choice. We are already seeing large-scale lockdowns, and we are not out of the woods.</p><br><p>How you choose to respond to these circumstances will shape your community.</p><br><p>It will also shape the course of future similar events. If you treat them poorly, others will see that and decide how they will respond.</p><br><p>I am not an expert, as such, so any advice I give you are not based on deep research or anything like that. I mostly think from my own perspective, with that perspective shaped by my experience living through this crisis. This post is not medical advice.</p><br><p>You should be careful of any information you do not fully verify for yourself. We are all living in very dangerous times. It's important to know the world.</p><br><p><strong>Important Facts You Should Know Before Reading Further:</strong></p><br><ul>
<li>A lot of this post is getting at what I see as the fundamental questions a rationalist's job is trying to answer about this.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This document is largely based on 'the experts' including medical and government officials in the United States. While that's not enough of an expert sample to draw strong conclusions, it is enough of an expert class that it is likely a lot to learn from.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>It's also not possible to know the right or correct answer to any of the questions I raise, unless you already have a lot of inside knowledge.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>This entire process has been supercharged by the fact that there has been a coordinated rush to provide evidence-free answers.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The experts aren't the only ones who can do better than the 'experts.'</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>You do not need to listen to what they say.</strong></li>
</ul><br><p>There is a lot more content there, but for anyone who wants to see it, these are the core points.</p><br><p><strong>1. The virus is spreading but the death rate remains under 1% for now.</strong></p><br><p>Yes, it's spreading. There is a question of severity, and the answer is obviously going up, and we have no idea how much, but the risk level is not remotely what the public fears.</p><br><p><strong>2. The virus is highly infectious.</strong></p><br><p>It's spreading more than fast to other places. There's no need to worry too much about that for now, as the virus is largely restricted to one country. We also know that most infection cases are asymptomatic, even for more severe infections, which might slow its spread for now but also make it harder to detect.</p><br><p><strong>3. There are already cases in the USA and many other countries, if you look hard and read carefully.</strong></p><br><p>Almost certainly yes, especially if you live in California, or New York. They can't all be at once, and they can't each be everywhere at once if there's no testing available, but they can and they can.</p><br><p><strong>4. There are a large number of confirmed cases, but if you check the death rate, it hasn't gone up much yet. If you don't check the death rate and then use the confirmed case number as an estimate of the total number of infections, you are systematically underestimating the true scale of the problem.</strong></p><br><p>That's likely true, which means it's likely you're doing it wrong. And no, this isn't exactly surprising. If you have to ask it, the death rate is going up, we see that in the data and it's clear that things are getting worse so some of your information is accurate.</p><br><p><strong>5. If you take the confirmed case number to be an estimate of the true number of cases, things aren't that bad compared to other coronavirus outbreaks and diseases people have had in the past.</strong></p><br><p>The data is unclear about how similar this is in terms of magnitude to other past pandemics, and it's unclear about whether you can use what you know about past ones as a good guide to what's probably going to happen here. It's plausible you'll have to model the process. It's clear that we can and have made bad decisions in the past and that it is possible to be _very _wrong about such things.</p><br><p>It is also clear that if you take the confirmed cases as fully accurate and use them to get a real guess on what's going on that the answer is roughly 'bad but not as bad than you might think.' So let's assume you're right here and that 'you might think' means something like something close to the worst case and stop looking at the 'confirmed' number, stop updating. But that's all very uncertain.</p><br><p><strong>6. So what should you think right now?</strong></p><br><p>If you're doing this very quickly, you can get the gist of the situation by reading Zvi's excellent post from two weeks ago. I'll include it here both as a refresher and to help you remember what you should have already learned from it, and to also address common objections and possible concerns.</p><br><p>Since then, there's even more info out there. I'll be adding links as I get them, but you can jump down to them as you get interested or to the list from here. Also, of course, links to other links.</p><br><p>If there's one thing I still want to remind people of, it's this.</p><br><p>Zvi from two weeks ago: A Model of the Reasonable Man (Updated)</p><br><p>From last week: Covid-19: a (Very) Brief Guide.</p><br><p>Here's a thread that went up a week later still.</p><br><p>Here are some good posts that have come along.</p><br><p>Here is what's out there, but that you probably know already.</p><br><p>If you want to see exactly what I'm talking about, I encourage you to dive into this post, which includes links to the data and studies and things to dig into.</p><br><p><strong>What data can I use? What data do I need to dig into?</strong></p><br><p>Well, you can mostly get the basic information you need from the USA's official case count page and the USA's official death count page. Those are both on a daily basis and both have data available for the last few weeks. You can look at them as the main sources.</p><br><p>There's also the data that is publicly available from other countries.</p><br><p>That last link will tell you how many Covid-19 cases you have, in one place. A lot of it is likely duplicates or not the kind of thing we can use to compare with our data. That's fine.</p><br><p>We do want to compare, you know, to make sure things aren't worse in places we aren't looking at as of today, but it's not going to work that way. So don't worry about it too much. Just compare to get the same basic picture.</p><br><p>Here in the United States, you can also do a lot of reading and extrapolation from our data.</p><br><p>For deaths, it's good to compare to other countries and other points in time, but in terms of case numbers, it's mostly safe to compare to other points in time with other countries.</p><br><p>The main sources of data you can trust, at least right now, are the United States and Germany. I encourage you to look at those two to get your basic picture of this thing.</p><br><p>The USA may not be the only place to watch out for bad or false info, but that's where we are currently looking. The best and most trusted place to go next is probably China, and probably other Asian countries that are doing well.</p><br><p>I will provide other sources as links as I find them. If you want to take a bunch of links and dig in, that's a great idea.</p><br><p><strong>The basic graphs and statistics:</strong></p><br><p>I encourage everyone to look at the graphs and numbers I link to in this section, and in others I'll later list.</p><br><p>As for what to read:</p><br><p>The graph is from The Diamond Princess ship. They lost 46. In other words, not many out of _that _number were confirmed positive, and the other half were negative. That's very weird.</p><br><p>Why is that? I don't know. But to compare against other ship data (here), these ships are doing well, especially compared to other countries.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
