<p><em>I.e. what looks like the statistics were not up to the standards of the paper when it was first made.</em></p>
</blockquote><br><p><strong>The editor</strong>, <strong>seething</strong>.</p><br><p><em>A very small paper, indeed.</em></p><br><p><em>Of course you see\xe2\x80\x94it's just a minor mistake, a misunderstanding.</em></p><br><p><em>Such a tiny little mistake, you would do well to remember it when presenting the paper to your colleagues, for even as minor an error as that can have a major impact on the acceptance of your paper. It's not often we have to remind you of this so starkly.</em></p><br><p>"Do not think of statistics as something that should somehow be performed by the statistician," said Dr. Yevgeni Sergeyev. "Statistics, while sometimes involving some calculation on paper, consists in the active participation of the entire research group in making statistical mistakes."</p><br><p>In that spirit, let us present to you, the following dialogue and an example.</p><br><p><strong>The Editor:</strong> Dr. Sergeyev, I must be candid. Your paper has some serious problems in its statistics. Most notably, I find some of the words used to describe the data unclear, and I'm not certain that what you say is what the data shows. For instance, in the second paragraph under heading 3, you wrote:<em> The mean age of subjects in the three studies in Table 1 was 50, 42 and 42 years, respectively.</em> But you should not have needed to use a separate asterisk with each number. In the third paragraph under "Results", you wrote:<em> By applying multiple linear regression to Table 3, we found a positive association of age and GGT concentration among men (B = 9.57, 95% CI 5.95-13.23, p &lt; 0.001), but not women (B = 1.01, 95% CI -0.58 to 2.64, p = 0.23), suggesting that the age and gender differences were attributable to other factors</em>;<em> A statistically significant positive association was found in men alone (B = 11.23, 95% CI 1.89-22.55, p =.01).</em> The correct way to describe the results of a multiple linear analysis on grouped data is as: B = 9.57 plus 95% CI of 5.95-19.23 and a p-value equal to 0.001."</p><br><p><strong>Dr. Sergeyev</strong>: Are you kidding? What difference is one or two letters of "respectfully suggest" in your opening paragraph making? It doesn't matter in the slightest. You still need to describe the data clearly, there is no law of mathematics that says it has to be reported precisely, as long you get the basic information in the paragraph with the asterisk or the paragraph following the table. The number of letters of "respectively suggest" used in the first paragraph does not matter, as long as the reader understands that you are going to report the data precisely.</p><br><p>__Dr_. Sergeyev_: You know, that's a very interesting point. In previous studies where you reported an association between age and GGT we were suspicious of those results as well. When two things are associated I am suspicious because 1) a chance correlation happens. 2) the two are associated for some unknown reason. I would like to see if those factors change or are constant over time, and if so what's causing the apparent changing association. Did you consider a study that compared men and women in the same age range, to see if the apparent difference might reflect some difference not attributable to GGT?</p><br><p><strong>Dr</strong>. Sergeyev: Well, no, by making the study so small we were careful to control our sample for age and gender. For example, in our study where we found a different association between the GGT and serum fructosamine, we controlled for age and sex for each subgroup, and still found that people in the top gender quintiles had different GGT concentrations.</p><br><p><strong>The Editor</strong>: No, sir. We have received your paper and analyzed your statistics in great detail. The data in Table 2 is completely not what the numbers in Table 1 or Table 3 really claim, and any correlation between the levels of the GGT and the fructosamine is completely explained by the factor of increased age. We believe that the paper as written does not meet the statistical criteria of replicability or reproducibility, even though it is certainly interesting and in some aspects useful.</p><br><p><strong>Stroop</strong>: That, Dr. Sergeyev...</p><br><p><strong>Dr Sergeyev</strong>: You're right, this paper doesn't meet the minimal criteria defined by the journals. To make sure you know, the editors and I have been considering rejecting the paper for a long time, as it doesn't meet the very strict criteria of the most common journals. Even if it did meet them, which it doesn't, the scientific community has already been warning the research community about this for a long time. Most importantly, what would happen if our paper is accepted with this data? No journal will accept a false positive result\xe2\x80\x94at least in a medical-related field. What if a positive result for GGT and fructosamine turns out to be a wrong association? Why would anyone publish such a paper?</p><br><p><strong>The Editors</strong>: Because the paper is interesting and we need to know. It's part of a general trend. So we will send the paper for external replication, where the most reliable and prestigious journals will carry out the experiment, and we trust the results to be true.</p><br><p><strong>Streop</strong>: But what if the replication is negative?</p><br><p><strong>Abe</strong>: I am sure we have considered several options to be prepared for the worst.</p><br><p><strong>Giselle</strong>: Dr. Strop, don't you ever say anything bad about my brother to me again?</p><br><p><strong>Streops</strong>: I'm sorry, I was just trying to help the editors. The truth is we have the same background in scientific statistics as you, so we fully appreciate the importance of being very precise and careful about reporting the exact results of the data.</p><br><p>The Editor and the reviewers met together and agreed that the statistics of the paper should be improved and that, as long as most of the other data and analysis were valid and interesting, they would not reject the paper.</p><br><p><strong>It was published and accepted!</strong></p><br><p>[Note: The dialogue is fictitious and all dialogues in this post have been made up by me. I do not endorse anything that is not expressed in this post.</p><br><p>The main lesson I'm trying to drive at here is that I think it is very important for authors to present the data precisely, and that people should not think of statistics in any way as the domain or thing of the statistician (or the researcher in the field) when presenting data.</p><br><p>Also, I think presenting statistical findings incorrectly in a journal article can easily be seen as an insult against the author.]</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
