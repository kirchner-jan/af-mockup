I am mostly relying on Scott Alexander's overview of the medium in <em>Weirdtopia</em>. I have also done my own research.</p><br><p>What is this?</p><br><p>For a certain type of person, <em>Scott Alexander's We Are</em> <em>Laugh at Science</em> has been a significant part of their intellectual awakening. For a different type of person, the Harry Potter fandom has been a significant. These two subcultures are examples of specific groups of people who share certain intellectual interests; the rationalist and Harry Potter fandoms comprise the entire Internet for people who are interested in fiction, but that does not mean they have the same interests as rationalists and Harry Potter fans in real life. Most people who are interested enough in these fandoms aren't yet interested in rationalism or in other specific intellectual causes. I have written this material because it's a subcultures that I would consider fairly significant.</p><br><p>Here is a brief timeline of the medium on the Internet so far:</p><br><ul>
<li><strong>1996: First fanfiction collection</strong>, 'Boon'</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>1998: Anonymously publishes HPMOR</strong>, begins to populate HPMOR's own website and the fanfiction.net site with Harry Potter fanfiction (and also posts this material there in the meantime)</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li><strong>2004: Boon publishes the fic collection "Three Worlds Collide", and announces the "Three Worlds Colliding" mailing list</strong></li>
</ul><br><p>I'm hoping to keep this brief and provide links for further reading.</p><br><p>History of the Rationalist Fiction Subculture on the Internet</p><br><p><em>This section of the article is by Scott Alexander, who does __comparable content on a regular basis__; the original article covers the general case of Harry Potter fanfiction. If you're not reading here on Less Wrong, you probably have the equivalent of those two things.</em></p><br><p>The Three Worlds Collide mailing list was a mailing list dedicated to the sharing of Harry Potter fanfic. The Three Worlds Collide collection was the first collection of the fanfic and also contained the first "re"edit of HPMOR, by John Maxwell.</p><br><p><strong>Fic collection sites</strong> were among the first online communities; for most people the major sites were fanfiction.net and Alicorn's HPMOR fanfic.</p><br><p><strong>Newspaper-like websites</strong> began to spring up, most prominently Slashdot, though the first news aggregation site Slashdot does appear to have been founded in December 1997. (There was also a Slashdot during the height of the Harry Potter fandom, but it seems to have mostly been a different community.) The largest and most long-lived Slashdot of the time was one that aggregated all the news sites that appeared between November 1997 and April 2001, and also contained links to the largest collection of Harry Potter fanfan fiction (plus other Harry Potter content).</p><br><p><strong>Anonymously publishes H.P. fic</strong> is the original Harry Potter fanfishery, going back more than 10 years before the major sites published anything. Unfortunately it appears to have gone under the name of 'the site with all of Scott's fic', though I cannot find out which version from the two I can link to. It also had a website, www.sl4.org, which may or may not have been related.</p><br><p><strong>2001\xe2\x80\x942005: Rationalist fiction as 'official story'</strong></p><br><p>In 2001, Scott Alexander published his novel <em>The Emperor's New Fandom</em>, which introduced the term 'rationality'. It became a bestseller and a significant contributor to rationalist activism and publishing. However, it seems it created an identity problem to some; a number of readers and writers reacted to it by saying there was a rift between the 'rationalist' community, and the 'fanfiction' community. These two communities have in recent times become more united again; they've even held events together.</p><br><p>The story goes that the authors wrote 'rational' characters, and that's where they left their 'fans'. And perhaps this is true. However, to this day the rationalist readers of rationality don't read the fiction in 'our' sites the same way they did ten years ago. It's still a fact (according to Scott Alexander's blog) that in the year 2008 there is a site dedicated to fanfiction (specifically 'new media') that has more members, many of whom are fans of 'rationalist' fiction, than there are rationalists in the whole world.</p><br><p>After <em>The Emperor's Fan</em> came out, Scott Alexander made some remarks about the value of "literary expression versus rationalism" that seem to have been the catalyst to the creation of rationality fiction on the web:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>What's really interesting is that the people who create fiction are mostly rationalists or at least share rationalist tendencies. The "fanfiction."wiki has some really great writing (hint: read Scott's "Necronomicon"), but they seem to be rationalists as well. It's not exactly common, but rationalist writers are pretty likely to be fans[,] and the rationalist blogosphere is pretty big on fanfiction. (Yes, there are several popular fics written by atheists but they seem to have been influenced by Buddhism and other Eastern religions, which makes them less rational and more obscure.)</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Scott Alexander later says that "The best 'rational fiction' probably has something to do with rationality, though."</p><br><p>And the first such fiction is:</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><p><strong>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</strong>, which began as a fanfiction on fanfiction.net; this was not the first Harry Potter fanfiction, but it may have given rise to the idea.</p><br><ul>
<li>\t</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>The Fun Theory Sequence</strong>, published on Less Wrong</p><br><ul>
<li></li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>HPMOR, published on fanfiction.Net.</li>
</ul><br><p>And so we have the first collection of 'rational' fanfiction:</p><br><ul>
<li>Three Worlds Collide, by John Maxwell</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>The Fun Theory Sequence, by Eliezer Yudkowsky</li>
</ul><br><p>Rationalist fiction also appears on the website HPMOR, which began to be populated by Eliezer's fanfic and was soon joined by new authors.</p><br><p><strong>2007: First year that r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmor becomes active</strong></p><br><p>In 2007, the year after HPMOR became the source for the first real growth of the community (as far as I can tell, there was nothing much on the Internet before that), we see the r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmo IRC room. In 2009 it is joined by several others and is renamed to r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmoran. From then on it seems to have become the site for rationalist authors and fans.</p><br><p>The Fun Theory sequence was made the top voted post of all time on LessWrong on the anniversary it was made a top-level post and now has the title You Fail Math Forever. The Fun Theory sequence is still well up there at the time it was posted and it is the single most upvoted post on the site. And so on.</p><br><p><strong>2014: HPMOR goes off-site, r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmoru appears</strong></p><br><p>I don't have a good picture of what was happening before this but at some point it seems the r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpr/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmoru site gets started\xe2\x80\x94it's the next in the history of Less Wrong and r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmr has a new section. I'm not sure how 'official' this is\xe2\x80\x94does it have an rss feed?</p><br><p><strong>2017: The Rationalist Community is in need of its own website</strong></p><br><p>At some point someone (probably Eliezer himself, in his capacity as executive chairman of the Less Wrong organization, I believe?) says a simple html file is insufficient for the rationalist community. In order to help organize the information, Scott Alexander creates r/\xe2\x80\x8bRationalist on lesswrong.com</p><br><p>So the rationalist community has its own website at r/\xe2\x80\x8brationalist</p><br><p><strong>2019: HPMOR is published on fanfiction dot net</strong></p><br><p>It's 2019, and Scott Alexander has a novel coming out on fanfiction dotnet:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Fanfiction.net, the site that hosts "Harry Potter And The Methods of Rationality" and a few other "rationalist" works, hosts some of the best "rationalist" fiction, but unfortunately it's not a great place for the curious non-autistic person. It looks like a bad version of BBSing in early 1990\xe2\x80\xb2s, and in practice is as close as you can get to being a MUD (multi-user dungeon). So Scott Alexander created his own blog, under the same name as the online r/\xe2\x80\x8brationalist social network, but in which he can talk as casually as possible about all the amazing stuff on fandom.net (the real name is actually r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmore, though r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmror is the one linked to, so r/\xe2\x80\x8bhpmre is the real one.)</p>
