<li>Some commenters on that Facebook thread were confused by why the conversation is worth sharing, but for me that thread was an incredibly valuable exercise in clarifying my own thinking processes and biases (at least insofar as those processes and biases have influenced my beliefs about morality) \xe2\x80\x94 so I think the discussion is worth sharing. \xe2\x86\xa9</li>

<li>Here is a transcript of the part of the Facebook conversation that confused me. </li>
</ul><br><p>From the transcribed version:</p><br><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Liron. I'm a bit confused. You said there are moral facts, and that morality is not just whatever people happen to feel like, right?&gt; &gt; SarahC. Yes, that's correct.&gt; &gt; Liron&gt; And I find that very surprising. So, to me, it looks like morality is just something that people construct, like art, religion and philosophy. I find it odd that it would claim to be something that exists independent of people and, since that in my view is obviously false, I also find it also obviously false. But maybe you can explain how I'm wrong about this.&gt; &gt; SarahC&gt;  Oh I see. OK, to answer your question, you are wrong. Here's what I wrote in my post on this topic, which you can read at [link] (I've added a couple of comments to illustrate the issues):     </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote><br><blockquote>
<p>I sometimes get the impression that people think of  morality as a <em>priveliged property,</em> sort of like weightlessness. There's a famous story from the 1700s about a ship foundering in a storm, the survivors of which prayed very earnestly to God to save them, and he heard them, and then they were rescued. You can almost <em>hear</em> that moral realism just has to be true in such a case, it being so obviously the case in other cases.  </p>
</blockquote><br><p>But it is not like that at all.  </p><br><p>We use morality to carve up the part of the world that we share between people, to prevent the race to the bottom of mutual suffering, to facilitate coordination between people, and to have shared values that people aren't trying to manipulate (and they don't, if we value our rights).  </p><br><p>In the same way that the shipwrecked people were praying to God because they thought that was better, or maybe a more effective, way to save themselves than just managing to paddle faster (because they, like God, were good at that sort of thing).  </p><br><p>And you would think that the people who think moral realism is a priori obvious, would immediately realize that morality is not a priveliged property in this sense \xe2\x80\x94 you can't "take" morality and "add" it, as if morality being a priveligied property was an additional fact about the world, that has to be assumed. You can't get morality just by assuming that the universe is rational.  </p><br><p>This is not an appeal that moral realism turns out to be false, or that morality turns out to be unimportant. The shipwrecked people, like God, would need to go where the evidence points, and figure out morality for themselves.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
