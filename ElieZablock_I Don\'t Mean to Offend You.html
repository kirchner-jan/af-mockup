Those people may just hear that their hobby happens to be rationality. Some may hear about the community from a more specialized source. They hear it from a friend, a scientist, or an economist. They might still be confused about what "rationality" is and what Less Wrong is. Or not.</p><br><p>Some are aware that it is a community and may be wondering why. Perhaps they are thinking about whether or not they want to learn more.</p><br><p>It can be frustrating to be a student of rationality and never know the answers to your problems or be unable to figure out what's wrong after trying.</p><br><p>It's also frustrating to have to come up against something that's the opposite of what you believe and get no help.</p><br><p>I'm making fun of my friend who I've known for 20+ years and a mentor that I worked under. These people have had a deep impact on me. They've changed me. And they're part of my social group.</p><br><p>There are a few people who disagree with the majority of Less Wrong, but are a part of that majority. Those people also, have a deep impact on the people they interact with.</p><br><p>But there are other people who are aware and interested in the site but probably wouldn't have found it if I had not reached them.</p><br><p>It isn't unusual.</p><br><p>And I've done that with a variety of different topics.</p><br><p>I wanted to share this as an example. To give people a general idea. Also to illustrate the range of people who don't know what Less Wrong is about from when they first hear about it.</p><br><p>Maybe I've just been lucky. Maybe those other people are a little more careful.</p><br><p>I've reached some people with ideas similar to my friend and mentor, but who hadn't heard of Less Wrong.</p><br><p>I've made a few friends of this variety. Even those who agreed on topics and who know each other. I've never asked them questions and gotten answers I found wrong.</p><br><p>My ideas and arguments for how they think can make me seem like a raving lunatic to them.</p><br><p>My friends and mentor and co-workers and the people I've met through the rationality community are often very tolerant and understanding of my ideas. But their perspective makes sense and they might argue a different point of view.</p><br><p>People who are interested in rationality, especially through this community, have a lot of overlap with people who would disagree with me and be very intolerant.</p><br><p>Or if someone was just exposed to rationality and then I'm exposed to rationality, it creates an interesting situation and makes people think. And maybe that person will start to disagree with what I claim. And maybe I'll have the opportunity to explain my ideas to them.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
