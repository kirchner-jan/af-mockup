But I can point out a few things which suggest there might be something to it after all. Or not. We'll see.]</em></p><br><p><strong>I.</strong></p><br><p><em>Some Possible Causes For Weird Results In Mathematics</em></p><br><p>There's this thing that some people do. It looks like this:</p><br><p>In other parts of the mathematical world, this might just be a problem with measuring certain things. Maybe other people are using different measuring tools. But if you take those points that all fall on a trend in the upper-left, it seems like this is happening in many different areas of math. And when you think about how few areas of math seem to follow a certain trend, that tends to point to something more.</p><br><p>Some people are calling this a bias. Others are calling it the "Einstein effect", which is the tendency of famous mathematicians to appear disproportionately often in the statistics of other famous mathematicians. There are also other explanations. For example, some fields are growing, so as they fill up fewer mathematicians are able to work, at which point they give mathematicians in the fields less attention. The fields themselves may not believe this, instead insisting that there are many more famous mathematicians than in the past. Maybe there really are? Maybe MIRI really deserves this?</p><br><p>There are also explanations about whether different people really are different when it comes to what they get done. It's a common argument, but I still keep hearing it, so might there be more to it than people think?</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>Here's an argument I frequently hear:</p><br><p>Math is about building gears. Gears are useful because they let you predict stuff (with high reliability). If you predict that a gear will be there, and it isn't, that's strange. This means you can't really have gears without knowing how things are different from other things. Now, you could be wrong about how gears work; after all, it's hard to know everything about everything that exists. But the standard model of gears assumes that if a gear is not there then it was always there, and that something must be different.</p><br><p>Now, this sounds like a reasonable argument. When I was in school and learning about gears, I did have that one particular thing I was trying to do. I thought about gears in terms of how they allowed you to compute things with high accuracy, and I was trying to figure out how to build a gear that would help with the calculations I wanted to make. It made a lot of sense. It <em>sounded very logical and reasonable</em>.</p><br><p>So, I did get some gears.</p><br><p>They were kind of weird.</p><br><p><strong>III.</strong></p><br><p>Like most other subjects in school, math is all about measuring. So what happens if you don't have any measure to compare things to?</p><br><p>If you just see something without any measure to compare it to, it's hard for anyone to come up with the right comparison. And if things like time periods and ages can take multiple different forms, it's hard even to come up with different forms to compare things with. After all, when you have no measure then there's nothing to compare them to. There's no standard to see if they are different or not. This is a problem with <em>everything</em>, but it's especially acute in math. There's so many different things to measure that even if a given thing is exactly the same as the previous thing it will be hard to find something to compare yourself to. It's like trying to follow a single line: there's nothing to look at. The problem is, if they're different, <em>why</em>?</p><br><p>This is sort of what I meant from the beginning when I talked about gears. Gears were useful because they let us predict stuff pretty reliably, and if the gear that we're trying to build is not there then we should ask, "What was preventing that one from being there?" Otherwise we should be able to replicate its behavior.</p><br><p>And in math, this is basically the situation. As long as things are behaving the same, why bother doing anything? Maybe there are more ways to get the same results, that some people didn't realize, but you can have a strong suspicion that you're reinventing the wheel and you should go find someone smarter than you to solve it. Maybe, even if it's one step at a time, you can find a different way of doing it, an approach that gives you a new way of thinking about things. Maybe there <em>is</em> a way.</p><br><p>So here's an important fact: there is often more than one way to do it.</p><br><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><br><p>For example: take the area formula for the volume of a cone, which is like this:</p><br><p>(3/\xe2\x80\x8b2 * \xcf\x80) * (1 \xe2\x88\x92 1/\xe2\x80\x8b2(1-x^2))</p><br><p>In the formula, x is the radius. In an old geometry class I took, our teacher told us this was the volume of a sphere given its radius. (If y=1 and x=r, then 1-y^2=1-r^2.)</p><br><p>It's kind of hard to know what exactly is being asked for when you plug that formula into Wolfram Alpha. It sounds like our teacher wants you to plug in its radius and find out what the volume is, but since there is more than one way of writing the radius that does not immediately give you the answer you might ask, "Why not just do it by hand? Why not use the formula that explicitly says what we should expect to find?"</p><br><p>Well, I was lucky and my teacher made <em>three</em> mistakes in her original formula. But if the original was correct, why not just hand calculate it, as our teacher did it?</p><br><p>The area of the cone formula is (3/\xe2\x80\x8b2 * 12) (1-1/\xe2\x80\x8b12(1\xe2\x88\x92(1\xe2\x88\x92x^2)\xcf\x892))/\xe2\x80\x8bx2, which is pretty complicated (I don't know what the heck that omega symbol is doing there, but even I can't make heads or tails of what it's doing).</p><br><p>To simplify the formula, I rewrote it as</p><br><p>(3\xe2\x81\x842 * \xcf\x80)(x-(1/\xe2\x80\x8b2(1 \xe2\x88\x92 x^2))\xcf\x89)/\xe2\x80\x8bx2</p><br><p>and then plugged both sides into Wolfram Alpha, which gave me the following (I don't want to spoil for anyone who wants to see it for themselves):</p><br><p>x\xe2\x88\x9e + (2/3 - x\xcf\x80 \xcf\x89)x2\ \xe2\x88\x92 (1/\xe2\x80\x8b6 x\xcf\x80 \xcf\x89(1 \xe2\x88\x92 x\xcf\x80))x2\ \xe2\x88\x92 x\xcf\x80 \xcf\x89</p><br><p>which I rewrote as</p><br><p>x-(1/\xe2\x80\x8b6 x \xcf\x89(1 - x\xcf\x80))x</p><br><p>and then looked at Wolfram, but I'm not sure a) how long it would take for Wolfram to display that equation and b) if I could figure out where Wolfram got it from without knowing what the omega symbol refers to. (A quick search didn't turn up anything about it on its Wikipedia page, and the closest it came to mentioning it was something vaguely analogous to what I did.) Then we could plug that in.</p><br><p>The next step is to notice x=\xcf\x89-1\xe2\x88\x9a3, (1/\xe2\x80\x8b6 \xcf\x89(1\xe2\x88\x92x\xcf\x80))=(1/\xe2\x80\x8b6 - 3/\xe2\x80\x8b2 \xcf\x89)(1/\xe2\x80\x8bx) and (1/\xe2\x80\x8b6 - \xcf\x89)x+(1/\xe2\x80\x8b3)=(1/\xe2\x80\x8b2 - \xcf\x89/\xe2\x80\x8b6)(1/\xe2\x80\x8bx). You could in principle keep plugging things like that, but then you would have to find out where else this happened so you'd never know where you were getting your information.</p><br><p>So I saw that both our teacher and Wolfram had made mistakes, so I could be pretty sure this had been proven wrong. But for some reason it didn't occur to me that there might be one other mistake.</p><br><p>It was a bit embarrassing. In school I was very interested in getting my answers right, and sometimes I'd get confused about something and waste my whole period by getting stuck on it. One time I actually did it with Wolfram. So I thought I could see if I could just find the first mistake the teacher or Wolfram had made and double-check it.</p><br><p>I plugged in the formula, the x=\xcf\x89-2\xe2\x88\x9a3 answer, and got another Wolfram that displayed a different equation,</p><br><p>x\xe2\x88\x86 x^(\xcf\x89\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x9a3)x\xe2\x88\x9e + { (2/\xe2\x80\x8b3 x \xcf\x89\xe2\x88\x921/x)x^(\xce\xb5)x\xe2\x88\x9e \ - (1/\xe2\x80\x8b6 (-3/\xe2\x80\x8b2 \xcf\x89)x(1 - x\xe2\x81\x842) + {(2/\xe2\x80\x8b3 x ^2)(x^(\xce\xb5)) + 2})/x^(2\xce\xb5) };</p><br><p>and after plugging in the x=\xcf\x89 result, I got</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
