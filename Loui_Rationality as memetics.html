</ul><br><p>I used to think of rationality as the art of self-improvement. After the recent discussion of the term "memetics," however, I now think of rationality as an art of self-replication.</p><br><p>Rationalists are (Usually) Meme-s</p><br><p>It seemed to me that many rationalists value truth primarily because they value becoming more rational. My first model of the art of rationality assumed that rationality means becoming more rational about the things you already know. This has been, of course, my own personal experience and the experience of many other people I know. In fact, "rationality" for me is my attempt to self-correct according to my own self-model. So why this desire to become more rational? Some theories:</p><br><ul>
<li>Self-defeating, but trying to be more correct is the only way to become less incorrect.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Thinking that you are in the know already means you have already taken the first steps toward rationalism, and it is futile for you to continue on.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>You think you're more rational than you are, you've tried to be less irrational, and you're frustrated when you fail.</li>
</ul><br><p>I'm still not sure how best to account for all 3 of these observations, so I'll call my theory "memetic self-defeating-rationalism," or <em>RS-R</em>.</p><br><p>RS-R says that, in general, thinking you'll be more rational than you already are will make your cognitive performance worse because your expectations will be violated. But the general way to avoid violating expected-utility based utility models when you're planning is to have a model of the plan and a model of the future self, and make sure that your "self model" and the goal for yourself will not contradict before you start implementing the plan. So, I argue, our desire for epistemic rationality, which tends to be a rational goal in itself, is at least partially self-defeating. We fail to become more rational (in the sense of becoming more self-correcting and so on) because we have too high a tolerance for our own biases.</p><br><p>RS-C says that we think we are well-calibrated rationalists because we already do pretty well, so it's natural for us try to continue to update our self-model. But trying to <em>become more accurate</em> is bound to fail; there will usually be a discrepancy between our expectation and reality. What's more confusing is that people often seem to be aware of this, and yet still prefer to update, and so on.</p><br><p>RATIONALISTS ARE (OR ATLEAST MESSY) MEME-S.</p><br><p>The memetic immune system, of course, is the natural defense system of all living beings. Evolution built it to respond to foreign, invasive, parasitic agents, such as viruses, bacteria, or other harmful organisms. But for it to respond to our own genes and practices, so that they don't cause harm to themselves and others, we need to have some way of knowing if a mutation or infection of our genes is harmful enough to trigger an immune response. So evolution built a way for the genes of a species to communicate to its own members what's harmful and/\xe2\x80\x8bor what practices are beneficial, and how beneficial those practices are. The genes can then be selected based on how much those practices and behaviors pass on to the next generation. This communication is called "memes."</p><br><p>MEMES ARE EASILY MISLEADING.</p><br><p>Our genes use memes just as readily as our memes use genes. Memes are a wonderful vehicle for replication, but they're also highly mutable and adaptable for spreading and getting a foothold. If memes communicate how good something would be for them to be, then they are more likely to be selected by evolution than genes; but they can also be deliberately selected for. Memes can often come packaged inside other memes that are already quite successful, such as sports teams and political parties, because those memes are highly reliable signalers of their intended recipients' preferences and motivations. So the selection for which memes replicate is largely driven by how highly memetically successful the meme is.</p><br><p>MEME SELECTION IS DEEPLY DIVERSIFIED.</p><br><p>There are, of course, many competing memes in the world. So the question is, what is the ratio between the kinds of memes that are successful at being selected? Memes that will get a foothold and spread, such as the sports teams and political leaders mentioned above? Memes that are successful at spreading within a specific population, such as specific religious denominations? Memes that do not get a foothold, such as say science articles or self-improvement theories or sports coverage, but are instead passed on by their hosts? Perhaps even the best self-improvement articles, according to the self-improvement community, only have a success rate between 0 and 33%, because they are being subjected to so much criticism, or because they're already popular enough to have a large enough impact on the community that they wouldn't need much of a successful signal.</p><br><p>The selection process is far more diversified than many would like to think.</p><br><p>MEMA VE GETS CHASTY.</p><br><p>One more complication about this entire system has been glossed over is that meme selection is imperfect. This is where rationality as memetics comes in. Just as people have various genetic variants that give them different risk factors for getting certain diseases, so also people's genes and memes (individuals and memes) can cooperate to cause them to get to the point where they can start being more rational, more successful, and more successful at self-modeling and self-modifying their genes and memes. Some of the risk factors for disease and illness might also be associated with disease and illness success, which makes it especially important for health-related rational beliefs to be well selected for because otherwise people who hold them could end up more damaged later on.</p><br><p>THE MEME-IMMUNE SYSTEM IS A BLIND-SPOT.</p><br><p>An aside on Memetics</p><br><p>The concept of a memetic immune system was originally introduced by Dr. I.J. Good. I think this is a rather appropriate title, because a proper immune system has a mechanism for detecting and eliminating foreign invaders. A memetic immune system should similarly have a mechanism for detecting memes which do not conform to those of the host. We would also expect to find a mechanism which allows the host to identify memetically harmful memes, and which selects for and selects away from them, and perhaps even one which allows for the host to eliminate the memes when they are selected for.</p><br><p>We already have some of this. People know (or suspect) that other people might be biased and may make biased judgments about things. They are also aware of their own biases and often attempt to correct them. The ability to accept and correct your own biases is a strong indicator of the ability to accept that someone else's views are biased as well. But what is interesting (and perhaps somewhat more controversial) is that we have also begun to have a means of changing what we perceive our biases to be, and which things to focus on when attempting to correct for them. (See this LW post on habit formation, and the habit formation sequences, and the self-help habit formation sequence.) It's not clear whether these methods of self-modification are really quite as effective as methods of overcoming biases, which are more difficult. But it does seem that some techniques tend to work better than others. If you learn a valuable rationality technique and forget it, you'll probably forget it more quickly than if you never learned it.</p><br><p>We do not yet know whether our genes or memes will be more or less successful at spreading and taking a foothold than other memes. Perhaps they will, or perhaps they'll just be outcompeted on the same level. The memes that are most memetically effective for a community will probably tend to become more entrenched. And the ones most resistant to being infected by the meme of our self-model will be more likely to be chosen by evolution and to have a significant influence on our individual genes. As for how quickly the best self-help techniques will spread, if they do, I suspect they will be slow\xe2\x80\x94maybe years or even decades, but not centuries. I expect that most, if not all self-help memes will have a lasting impact, just as most anti-cannabis memes haven't yet been successfully replaced by memes promoting cannabis and other drugs. The question is <em>which memes</em> will be successful and how much of an effect it will have in shaping our genetics and/\xe2\x80\x8bor memes.</p><br><p>I feel that a better understanding of the selection process for our memes should be among the goals of a rationalist. I suspect there's already some discussion about this issue which I may return to to write in much more detail.</p><br><p>An Aside on Memes</p><br><p><em>Memes</em> are what our genes and memes are, but just a tiny smidgeon more complicated. A meme is an information structure which contains an instruction for how to implement a particular act in a recipient organism. Memes are selected by the organisms that receive them. They are generally composed by others for the purposes of passing on information. An algorithm is a meme which has been created for the purpose of furthering the message to others.[1]</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
