This post is an exercise in formalization of that concept.</p><br><p>Before continuing, I admit that this still feels unsatisfactory due to the following mystery: there is no fundamental distinction between classical and quantum physics. The laws look the same to me. A probability distribution is just an ordinary probability theory, and classical probability theory is nothing more than the simplest quantum one—it's very hard to say something new in that. Even the formal axiomatic approach of QM only gives an alternative way to prove the laws, not any special facts. So is there another "fundamental" "difference"? But what would it be? For one thing, everything I can think of, I can think of as a "quantum-like thing". Also everything I know about my memories and observations feels quantum-like: I experience the "collapse" of the wave functions. So there must be a deeper difference that <em>matters</em>. But what could it be?</p><br><p>To resolve such thoughts it's useful to have a working tool: a quantum-like mathematical formalism with only natural "quantum-like" assumptions. Fortunately, we have a candidate on hand: our beloved Hilbert space and its orthogonal bases. It's the same, but it feels different. The Hilbert spaces are always over complex numbers (or real numbers...). It's the space of complex numbers which feels different from its complex-valued counterparts. In particular, the operator θ from the previous post has a different form as a complex-valued operator. How different? Let's see! First we have this operator T(ω)=θ(ω)θ*(ω). It's an operator on the Fourier transform space Fω and takes two frequency modes ω,ω′ to the complex number T(ω,ω′). And that's all! No need for any complex-valued probabilities or Born ratios, just this T operator. And the Born rule corresponds to the identity T(ω)=1. So from a mathematical point of view, we have the "same" set of probability distributions as before, but everything is different.</p><br><p>__Added __for completeness: I'm saying the the physicalist story about the Born rule is "We can view it as a hypothesis in some classical statistical model for the world; it emerges when we look at the "logical" consequences of this hypothesis (for instance, in decision theory, it leads to the "updateless" kind of decision theories, see further discussion here)". The standard story here is, roughly speaking, that the Born rule is just a special case of a wider family of the Born-like probability ratios (the usual "additive" ones for example) for the decision problems where only one copy of the agent exists. (Of course such a probability will not appear in any physically-realizable model, since the standard quantum hypothesis, together with the assumption of only one copy of an agent, rules out the possibility of any future decisions.) The point I'm trying to make here is that this special case can be naturally viewed as a special case of the general family of ratios. If you think this is true, then it's probably best to say that the Born rule doesn't describe an actual physical process in the universe—or perhaps it involves several extra assumptions, maybe about the "decision problems" the agent considers, maybe even about the way the "logical consequences" of the hypothesis are calculated... The important thing to notice is that the "logic" does not have a single simple model.</p><br><p>(<strong>Update</strong>: an alternative idea here is to consider the "logical conclusions" as just a special case, i.e. the special "model" is really just probability theory in this case, and we've shown that this is equivalent to the standard Born rule in the "one-copy" case. This idea seems correct to me; I'll comment below.)</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
