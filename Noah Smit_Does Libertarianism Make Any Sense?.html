This eventually became apparent, such as in Scott Alexander's recent comment where he argues against the claim that most of the benefit from trade is concentrated on those who do the trade (this is often called the "specialization hypothesis"). His argument is essentially that if half the value I get from my factory is going to someone who has a different factory and I only have one part to play, that means that all my trade is going to other people and not to me, and since I have no special knowledge about the factory I'm not going to do very well relative to others. It takes two to have a trade and I could just as easily be one of those two parties and the benefits of trade wouldn't be more concentrated on me. I believe that the idea that a single trade benefits a single person has been disproven by modern economic theory which suggests that you will in fact do better to specialize and allow trade to happen.</p><br><p>In his reply to my comment, Scott Alexander provides an interesting critique, though I personally disagree with it (see the full post for more detail). In response to my own critiques of Scott's reply, I think I have a solid counter-counter-argument: I think that the specialized production model advocated by him and Robin Hanson (the "market for lemons") is far too low-fidelity and oversimplified for the purpose of making policy recommendations. I believe that in most cases when people advocate the market for lemons for policy recommendations, they don't have in mind a complete model of how things actually work, but rather a strawman's-model of what is being advocated.</p><br><p>In my opinion, a model of how production works can make a lot of sense, for example, when trying to describe how a specific production technology works or when trying to describe global economic trends. I don't know about making policy recommendations for global economic trends, as it's pretty hard to tell how you'd even go about that and what questions to ask about those trends.</p><br><p>There are a few more issues. First, I think that many people who advocate the market-for-lemons for policy recommendations are not aware that there are other models that make a bit more sense to start with. The other issue is that many of the people currently in power tend to have very little-to-no exposure to modern economics. So while many people in power know that the free market makes trade-offs, they are likely ignorant-by-default about many other important facts about economics, especially what happens when trade-offs cause suffering.</p><br><p>I'm a bit skeptical about this critique given Scott's past support for economic policies that have been called out as being highly restrictive and harmful. I'd be curious to hear what his take on global economic trends is. I am not an economist, so I wouldn't know what you'd even ask from me :-P. So here's your chance to get in touch with Scott and express your opinion on this interesting case of how economic policy can fail.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
