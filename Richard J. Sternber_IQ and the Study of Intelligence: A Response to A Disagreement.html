I am posting a short version, below, as an exercise in improving the quality of Less Wrong posts by improving the quality of the writing. I encourage others to follow suit!</p><br><p>I agree with Yudkowsky and Hanson that the term intelligence isn't well-defined, and that most of what is described as intelligence involves a mix of components not always easy to distinguish. They also propose a better terminology, "study of intelligence", that better characterizes the core intellectual activity of science, technology, and other forms of progress. Hanson's original argument against the use of the term intelligence is made in these two paper, if you're interested.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, these arguments also argue against a concept that I believe should be an important source of motivation for the study of intelligence and for the many questions we know to be related to it. This concept, which I call the "Study of Intelligence", is most succinctly presented in the title of this post, by Steven Pinker, author of <em>The Blank Slate</em> (2004), <em>How The Mind Works</em> (WJ Norton &amp; Co., 2003), and (as I understand it) other texts on cognitive development and evolution.</p><br><p>I find that Pinker makes a number of compelling points in his book (and indeed was highly commended last year by Bryan Caplan, another intelligent writer, for making the best case that he could that we should be less concerned about poverty and crime), but I also disagree with him about the study of intelligence. The case for the Study of Intelligence is not made clear in Pinker's work (except in the following passage, which I found especially interesting; emphasis he added:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>[...] For some time I have been suggesting that the social sciences need to study the mind as a separate and parallel discipline to the social sciences that study societies. The idea is not original. It was first put forth by the sociologist Richard S. Felson in the 1970s at the same time that the cognitive psychologists were beginning to argue with the idea of a single faculty of intelligence. To a first approximation, if you count social science research by political parties and interest groups, which is most heavily concentrated in the political science "sphere" rather than in biology, physics or psychology, the social sciences have studied minds relatively little. To my knowledge, the only one that's a member of the family we're interested in, and arguably the one with the brightest future, is psychology itself. As the cognitive psychologist Daniel Kahnemann puts it in <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, "Psychology has long recognized two kinds of mental processes (mental activities that occur rapidly and those that require slow computation), but as this research has demonstrated, rapid thought processes are surprisingly ineffective even at simple tasks, and slow processes represent the vast majority of human thinking." [p. 3]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>Although Pinker's citation of Felson is incomplete, a more thorough research search failed to find the actual work that Pinker supposedly relies on, and instead led to the following information:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>To my knowledge, of all the work that's been done on intelligence, the only one we're interested in is the cognitive psychology of intelligence, and specifically the cognitive psychology of general intelligence that includes fluid intelligence (g). In the last 45 years of trying to figure out the cognitive underpinnings of intelligence (g) and the other dimensions of human intelligence, the social sciences are the only disciplines that seem concerned about the nature and correlates of intelligence, but as far as I can tell, they just don't really go in that direction. I think it's fair to say that the social sciences have been studying intelligence in only a narrow, reductionist way. [Tucker &amp; Tenner, Intelligence as a Social Science: Its Evolutionary Bases, Development, Measurement and Empirical Investigations, in <em>The Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence</em>]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>If we accept this as broadly true, then we see many ways in which Pinker's claims are true. For instance, a quick search on Less Wrong's database reveals that the overwhelming majority of discussion of intelligence and human rationality has taken place within a single group, namely Less Wrong, and is dominated by Yudkowsky, Hanson, and other rationalists. Also, many of the ideas espoused there were introduced into Less Wrong by Pinker (e.g. the importance of genetics in intelligence and society, the genetic basis of some psychological abilities and their correlations with others, the relationship of the IQ-variance relationship with various traits, the nature and significance of individual-differences in intelligence, and the importance of g in particular).</p><br><p>The fact that most academic research on intelligence has taken place largely within this same small community, while simultaneously claiming the primacy of mainstream academic science, may indicate that the latter two forms of intellectual progress are in some sense distinct from one another. In other words, Yudkowsky's arguments about the role of intelligence in society, and his description of the nature of intelligence and the factors that influence it, may be more influential, and therefore a major source of progress, than some of the work in mainstream psychology that Pinker highlights.</p><br><p>As I have argued elsewhere (here, here and here), the study of intelligence was historically neglected, and that is partly due to the dominance of a small subfield within anthropology, the study of <em>cultural variation in intelligence</em> (and by extension its applications to other domains like economics or sociology or political science). But for reasons that are not understood, this trend in research is rapidly reversing in recent decades. (A brief overview of this historical change is available in the volume "Measuring Intellectual Ability" that <em>Thinking: Fast and Slow</em> was written to accompany, and in Pinker's book.)</p><br><p>A second point that Pinker seems fairly consistent about is the distinction between a field that has largely studied IQ (mainstream psychology) and those that, like Pinker's own work, have sought to provide an alternative conception of the nature of that same field which focuses less on IQ and more on the human component of cognition (psychology and cognitive neuroscience) and the social sciences (economics, sociology, political science).</p><br><p>This has long been a topic of debate in the cognitive-science community, e.g. see chapter 4 in <em>Thinking </em>(pages 85-116; a few excerpts are included below):[1]</p><br><blockquote>
<p>The concept of a 'general factor of intelligence' or 'g', as defined by the cognitive sciences, is the ability of the mind to reason, to make abstractions and apply them, to adapt flexibly to novel contexts\xe2\x80\x94to see through and beyond the immediate, to think in terms of the big picture, to be creative and un-anchored. These cognitive abilities cannot be measured reliably with any of the current cognitive tests that psychologists try to develop. But it is easy to describe the mind that is behind those tests, for example: a mind that can be trained, or at least made to approach the limits of its capacity. And even the best mind can be broken by disease, drugs, or brain damage. Moreover, it would be easy to improve on the current standard. [See "A Disagreement Over the Nature of Intelligence and Its Measures".]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>However, Pinker seems to imply that there is a qualitative difference between some domains (e.g., mathematical or mathematical-scientific problems, or a class of such problems) that are dominated by one's general intelligence, and those domains that are not. And Pinker seems to be assuming that this difference must be explained by the existence of qualitative differences in the brain architecture that underlies the two kinds of tasks. So Pinker's discussion of the implications of the study of intelligence\xe2\x80\x94an analysis that includes the possibility that this study will be used to develop techniques that will be applicable to a variety of other domains (e. g., applied rationality, economics, mathematics, etc.), including ones that are generally regarded as not "thinking-based"\xe2\x80\x94is potentially misguided.(p. 102)</p><br><p>For instance, Pinker cites the research of Keith Stanovich, author of <em>Who Is Intelligent?: Beyond IQ, School, and the Workplace</em> (MUP, 2002), among other sources in support of the claim that the study of intelligence is relevant primarily to domains of thought that are dominated by it. But Stanley has said (Stanovich &amp; West, Individual Differences in Rational Thinking: Implications for the Rationality Debate, <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, Vol. 84 (2003), p. 779):</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Stanovich has also been accused of cherry picking studies to support his positions in the Intelligence Debate. But the results of the meta-analysis are in line with what previous meta-analyses of the area have found. [See, for example, chapter 5 in the Intelligence Debate review by PISA (the Review Committee on Intelligence)]</p>
</blockquote><br><p>So, if IQ does tell us about the nature of some domains of intelligence, <em>Stanley</em> seems to believe that it's the <em>overall</em> nature. From his perspective, the importance of the study of all "thinking-based" domains is due to this fact. But, from Yudkowsky &amp; Hanson's perspective, the <em>overall _nature of high intelligence might be _indistinguishable</em> from the nature of high intelligence in some "thinking-based domains" like mathematics.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
