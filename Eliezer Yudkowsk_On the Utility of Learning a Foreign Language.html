"What should have been said, instead of what I actually said?"1</p><br><p>The idea is to <em>redeem</em> our fellow human beings, by teaching them the finer points of language and communication, and this in turn allows us to better understand others.</p><br><p>To do this, one must first be familiar with the <em>mistakes,</em> that is to say, the actual <em>reasons</em> for communication errors; and you can't do that if you can't actually <em>read,</em> of course, which requires reading.</p><br><p>I'm not exactly sure where I learned this from, but the standard piece of advice is to <em>avoid</em> using too many words. If you say to someone, "I can understand how you could say a thing like that even if I don't agree," you're doing it wrong.</p><br><p>There isn't much to say about this at this point.</p><br><p>To begin at the beginning:</p><br><p>Why are we using words at all? Why do language and communication take place, when it seems like the human species could have just as effectively transmitted all of their thoughts, and all of their other experiences, without ever saying a word?2</p><br><p>The answer is that language serves a useful function\xe2\x80\x94the purpose of communication.</p><br><p>Why do you say words? For one reason or another, one purpose or another, and a large part of this purpose is, in a certain narrow range of cases, <em>truth-conducive.</em> That is to say, it can be advantageous to tell other people what you actually believe.</p><br><p>But the problem is, if no one else knows your true beliefs, all kinds of problems can quickly arise. If there are two hundred other people in town, and my housemate's name is Betty, and I call her "Bety"\xe2\x80\x94_is it more likely that she's named Betty or Bety?<em>\xe2\x80\x94then the odds are that Betty has the same first name as her birth certificate shows. So in many cases, a word _simply does not convey meaning.</em> If people hear me say "Bety," they may guess that Bety has the same first and last name as an actual person. But Bety could be the opposite; or Bety could be an inanimate object\xe2\x80\x94as in the case of the housemate who's named "Betsy." And if I say "Betsy"\xe2\x80\x94is it more likely I mean Betsy the housemate, versus Betsy the object that sometimes answers the door? But when we know someone's name, the odds of that, in our current world of common knowledge, make any word <em>true.</em></p><br><p>Similarly, in certain contexts it could be useful to be able to communicate your true <em>beliefs,</em> in a case where nobody else may hold your belief itself\xe2\x80\x94for example, in court.</p><br><p>And similarly, the utility of language, for some kinds of statements, is in providing evidence. It is not just a mere <em>means of communication,</em> and I have to make that point explicitly; for example, suppose I meet another fellow who thinks on the same level as myself, and we have a disagreement that we can't agree upon. If I know that my argument means exactly the same thing to him\xe2\x80\x94or indeed, to everybody\xe2\x80\x94then I know that either we are both mistaken in our <em>beliefs.</em> Or else one of us must be mistaken in our <em>worldview.</em></p><br><p>Now, it may not seem easy <em>at all</em> to tell the difference between beliefs and worldviews, as such. And it's entirely possible our fellow human can't tell them apart at all! It may even be that our fellow human is right about the answer that our beliefs and their beliefs are interchangeable. It may seem that one can't possibly <em>know</em> what someone else <em>thinks;</em> and this may be something you can't even tell by looking at their face or body language or the tone of their voice. Our fellow human may be <em>blind;</em> they may have genuinely missed the point of your argument. Not for nothing do I repeat again that you should not think of yourself as being a logical positivist.</p><br><p>But if you can't tell the difference between belief and worldview, and yet you and your interlocuter can't both be wrong about the same thing, then it <em>must</em> be the case that <em>something</em> is being conveyed by your words\xe2\x80\x94even if it's only the speaker, or just one of the speakers. As yet, we're not quite sure how words work, or how meanings are represented in the human brain\xe2\x80\x94where they are, inside that huge complicated mess of neurons and neurotransmitters\xe2\x80\x94but whatever it is, it has to happen between those two black boxes we call "beliefs" and "worldviews."</p><br><p>By understanding how this works, we should be able to <em>notice</em> when a speaker's words do not truly communicate anything at all! "What did she mean by that?" you may ask, remembering the experience of having misunderstood something others <em>said,</em> even when you couldn't fault their actual words.</p><br><p>1A human's Guide to Words, Part 1.</p><br><p>2In contrast, most people <em>do</em> understand that saying "My mother had beautiful red hair! " makes it more likely that you have maternal relatives than paternal relatives, where the words are understood for the intended effect; which is why we use different words for "family" than "genetic relatives."  You could call it not-quite-having-faith-in-the-truth-values-of-words-but-just-having-faith_ing_ it as well as using faith.</p><br><p>"The more precisely you define a word, the less certain other men can be to use it in a definite manner."\xe2\x80\x94Benjamin Franklin</p><br><p>"And yet people are not ready to believe that a mere word can be taken seriously. They will not be convinced because the label is too ephemeral... They will go on trying to capture the subtle shades of meaning inherent in the word."\xe2\x80\x94Stephen Sondheim, Sondheim &amp; Waters, <em>Sweeney Todd</em></p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
