I'm doing this as an example of the general point in a few cases I have made about philosophy.</p><br><p>"But I know my reasoning, and my reasoning is good!"  "If you know your reasoning, you should be able to justify your belief, because if you can't do that, you could be doing something wrong, or mistaken, or crazy!"</p><br><p>My reply is that, on the contrary, when it comes to philosophy, you cannot have your arguments <em>reduced</em> to the point where the rest of humanity can know that they're not crazy. "Epistemic circularity" is a known problem in philosophy.</p><br><p>People are allowed to start with epistemology and move on to logic, or something else that doesn't have the problem of epistemology. That's fine. But the standard to which to hold yourself <em>is</em> epistemology.</p><br><p>This, I submit, is the standard we should impose on others: if a subject has <em>epistemology</em>\xe2\x80\x94if it deals with words, and maps, even though the rest isn't logic\xe2\x80\x94then it should be expected to have <em>logic to go with</em>. If it deals with numbers to add up, or particles to be arranged in a way that gives its predictions\xe2\x80\x94if it is a discipline that deals with such simple stuff, why, we <em>have</em> to expect it to deal with simple stuff like logic.</p><br><p>And if you're starting with epistemology (as an example, of course, not intended to hold against others), there are lots of things that follow from that. The map can't correspond to the territory, or there's contradiction-detection problems, or <em>something.</em></p><br><p>And if not? If not, you're just starting with logic. And if you start with logic, why don't you need epicycles? It's your argument.</p><br><p>You start where you started because your beliefs are not self-justifying; because you don't think you're insane. And there is no test that you should pass\xe2\x80\x94no final authority whose pronouncements your belief must comply with. Your beliefs have no weight; the rest of your argument doesn't count. Not even as a heuristic.</p><br><p>I'm not saying you should abandon logic entirely, in order to conform with common sense. But you should understand what is expected of you, and you should do what it takes to do it.</p><br><p>I claim epistemology\xe2\x80\x94a study of how we know things\xe2\x80\x94requires <em>logic</em>.</p><br><p>One possible objection here is to say:  "Why not just have the argument that I think will convince you?"</p><br><p>The answer is that if you do only that sort of argument, you're not likely to ever convince yourself of the truth of your beliefs.</p><br><p>Suppose I claim that the sky is blue, and you argue that the universe is finite, and you can't possibly be blue as you claim to see; for the universe contains nothing that could be blue, you know. This is an argument that you think is good, and it seems to me that if your argument is <em>that good</em>, you won't ever be <em>quite</em> sure that you're wrong\xe2\x80\x94which is a problem, because that leaves you open to someone coming along and convincing you that the sky is yellow, or that the universe is infinite.</p><br><p>I, on the other hand, would like to be right\xe2\x80\x94and even if you don't say outright that you'd like to be right, I'm not the first one to say that to you. So long as the sky is blue and the universe is finite...  then I want to know why, if you know that the sky is in fact blue, that you still hold this particular belief...</p><br><p>I'm asking to know your source-code.</p><br><p>On one standard of argumentation, what is "good" does not include the ability to be convincing yourself. On the standard of epistemic circularity you can't just do an infinite number of backtrack searches until you find something that works. For all they know, you may be insane.</p><br><p>Once upon a time, there was a rationalist. They took a step beyond that standard, and the result was a rationality in which no argument they gave for "X is true" should have persuaded them to believe X. Instead, they took one more step...</p><br><p>You aren't allowed to try to be right in any way if you start with epistemics.</p><br><p>I mean that literally:  Don't claim your conclusions are justified by anything except your own belief in the justification.</p><br><p>But when that <em>doesn't</em> get you anywhere, and <em>does</em> get you someplace interesting, then <em>maybe</em> you should rethink the epistemology you started with. There's something to be said for a rationality that doesn't require you to just believe what sounds right...</p><br><p>It's the question of "Why are you willing to believe this so confidently, if your argument isn't strong enough to convince other people?"  Which we can get into in the next article.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
