It's like the word "heap" or "fungus", or "spark."  In fact "decoherence" is just a word invented to describe human experience\xe2\x80\x94a human concept\xe2\x80\x94not anything fundamental. If someone were to claim that quantum physics "proves that electrons are waves," well, that would be as nonsensical as saying that quantum physics "shows" that electrons are heaps of amplitude. It would be like claiming that the quantum physics proves that electrons exist.</p><br><p>So to start at the beginning: what does it mean for a world to be "decoherent"?</p><br><p>Imagine that there is a single point M0 in the configuration space, and then we make a measurement at M1 and find out "M1 decohered with M0".  Then we make another measurement at M2, and find out "Measured at M2, M1 decohered and M0."  Let's draw the M0-M1 and M0-M2 diagrams and call the last diagram M'2, to distinguish it from the world M2 it came from:</p><br><p>In English: I made a first measurement at M0, and a second measurement at M1, and the two measurements interacted and became disentangled, so they are no longer interacting. I repeated this process until I ran out of degrees of freedom. All interactions between the two worlds M0 and M2 are mediated by particles in the M\xe2\x80\xb22 diagram.</p><br><p>If you make a measurement on M2, you see that M1 decoheres with M0, and you will see that M\xe2\x80\xb22 decoheres with some new "world" M\xe2\x80\xb21 that isn't interactively entangled with M1 or M0.</p><br><p>We might call M\xe2\x80\xb21 the "branch", and M\xe2\x80\xb20 the "branch-condition".</p><br><p>If the two worlds seem to come apart, then this is because they are coming apart due to the "branch" M\xe2\x80\xb21 branching off from the "branch condition" M\xe2\x80\xb20.</p><br><p>There are <em>laws of physics</em> that can cause M\xe2\x80\xb21 to branch off from M\xe2\x80\xb20; that was what the two measurements interacting via the entanglements entailed. And there is in fact a physical interaction, mediated by some real particles, that sends entanglement from M1 to M\xe2\x80\xb21 and also to M\xe2\x80\xb20. But the <em>reason</em> the M\xe2\x80\xb21 and M\xe2\x80\xb20 come apart is a <em>consequence</em> of <em>interaction</em> with each other's components, not anything fundamental.</p><br><p>(See also decoherent worlds, for how this kind of branching off from the initial condition can look from the inside.)</p><br><p>The actual physical process of decoherence is a somewhat more complicated process in which all the particles whose configuration we're measuring, are, in fact, traveling apart; due to the momentum conservation laws or something, the particles don't just immediately fly apart, they just <em>stay</em> where they started, and decohere with each other more and more slowly. Or something; I'm still having trouble figuring out the <em>formal</em> equations.</p><br><p>In any case, the process of decohereing is something that <em>does</em> happen; it might even be the dominant way decoherence happens. But the process of decoupling is not itself decoherent.</p><br><p>So you and the Great Beyonder are not one world, even in the most obvious sense of "one".  You have a definite history of past versions of yourself splitting off and decohering with their future versions, just as some version-moments of Great Beyonder will decohere with some future version-moments. And when, in your personal history, you were in a single world (like all the other version-moments), you were still decoherent with all previous versions, just in a more distant past.</p><br><p>It's <em>the decoherence that kills you</em> that defines where you'll end up. There's nothing in the physics that implies that your total future mass will have a single point M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb20 at the end of it. And there's no particular reason you should expect M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb20 to come apart into two distant worlds like M\xe2\x80\xb21 and B, which would have two different versions of yourself in them at different time-steps, with little apparent connection to each other except that each one's future history has decohered with the past history of the other.</p><br><p>All that the laws of physics seem to predict at the end of the decoherence and branching, is the decoherence which decoheres each particular M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb20, and leaves M\xe2\x80\xb20 "distant" from all other M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb20. And it <em>is</em> this decoherence that destroys your "personal identity" as a distinct point in the final configuration space. But this decoherence is <em>not itself decoherent;</em> there is no decoherence splitting off the world M0 and leaving M\xe2\x80\xb20; the M\xe2\x80\xb20 still end up near M0, as if they were part of the very beginning of the decoherent process.</p><br><p>There is no point in the Great Beyonder's physics, where, after splitting off a new personal history M\xe2\x80\xb21, its past version M\xe2\x80\xb20 would have to end up in a separate part of the Great Beyonder configuration space (perhaps in another world), and then have its own future history, as if it was another human being. All that M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x9e could possibly be, is the history of one particular M\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x9e-moment that decoheres from the rest of the history, and is only <em>one</em> element in the final configuration.  (Not necessarily the whole final history, just a single point in the final history in particular.)</p><br><p>All this is just to repeat, in somewhat different language:</p><br><ul>
<li>There <em>is</em> no global law of physics that says, once we split off our own "branch" and separate from ourselves, that we have to <em>immediately</em> go out into the <em>universe</em> and spread out, but instead happen to be in our particular future branch. The laws of physics don't say that.</li>
</ul><br><p>In fact, a moment can go by without any entanglement between "you" and the Universe, if the law of physics holds otherwise. You can stay perfectly still and decohere faster and faster.</p><br><p>The actual laws of physics, if we knew about them, would also rule out this sort of "inertial separation" from the rest of existence. It's not in the laws of physics anywhere.</p><br><p>So there isn't anything <em>fundamental</em> about the Great Beyonder physics that can rule out this "inertial branching", because the "branching worlds" and the "branch histories" don't actually contain any information about how fast you <em>are</em> going. And if there <em>were</em> a law that said inertial separation, it would not actually be entailed in the laws of anything in your model of how the <em>local</em> universe works, but only by <em>logical implications</em>. So you shouldn't have <em>deduced</em> the "inertial branch branching" from the laws of physics, because the "inertially branched world" is not a <em>logical</em> consequence of anything in your physical picture of the universe. So you shouldn't expect to find this "logical implication" in the physical laws that were actually discovered, because the logical implication would not be entailed in anything else that had been discovered.</p><br><p>Decoherence destroys all the laws that were previously protecting your identity, and this seems to imply that you should expect there to be a law that says "If you experience an event which decoherentizes your branch, you will experience your future history decohering more slowly."</p><br><p>But if decoherent branches don't contain any information about their <em>relative _tangencies with the rest of the Universe, why should your speed of decoherence be so much faster with respect to some distant parts of the space-time? But the decoherence is not itself "decoherent," so it shouldn't be that easy to "decohere" the way light or _people</em> or your entire <em>experience,</em> which is also not itself "decomposable" in the standard mathematical sense.</p><br><p>Indeed, if your <em>personality</em> is somehow represented by the <em>distribution</em> over worlds in which you end up in, then you, your personality, ought to be able to "decoherentize" into a separate part of your own <em>distribution</em>\xe2\x80\x94into a separate point in the same configuration space.</p><br><p>The <em>distribution over world-histories</em> in which you end, does not have a single point that can be physically decomposed into "you", "your personality", etc.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
