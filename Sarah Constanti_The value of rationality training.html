</ul><br><p><em>This is the third post in what will be a multi-part mini-sequence on x-risk. _The first part explained what x-risk is and why it's an urgent problem. The second part explained the concept of the "value of information," which is the reason why thinking about x-risk is useful and worth doing. This third part will go into much greater detail about _how</em> to go about doing actual x-risk mitigation work; it will make the case that if you want to go from "doing nothing" to "actively helping mitigate x-risk", you should train in rationality skills, and there are likely benefits more broadly.</p><br><p>Why we need more rationality</p><br><p>I'd like to start out by describing what my <em>actual</em> motivation for writing this mini-sequence is: I used to be a <em>lot</em> less effective at accomplishing my goals and getting stuff done. I realized that I had a major bottleneck in my life that I didn't have enough time to improve. Now I have enough time that I no longer need to be so effective\xe2\x80\x94I can procrastinate on things without causing huge harm. I was motivated by an explicit desire to be more effective at my goals.</p><br><p>The problem I noticed was that <em>it is difficult for people who are not yet very good at achieving their goals to be effective</em>. It often takes an intentional effort to <em>notice</em> that you are failing. This can be improved by training in rationality.</p><br><p>I think the specific cognitive skill of rationality skills may be applicable whenever you want to be <em>more effective</em> at achieving your goals.</p><br><p>This isn't particularly controversial\xe2\x80\x94it's standard LW advice on how to make better life decisions, and we also have a LW sequence on how to do better in work; see, for example, Making your own decisions, or Overcoming procrastination. </p><br><p>The <em>more interesting</em> question is: what are the cognitive skills that are useful for <em>general</em> problem-solving (whether in school, at work, or personal life)? And is rationality one of these?</p><br><p>How (rationality) </p><br><p>Training that you are unfamiliar with tends to be very effective at achieving your goals, at least for a while. I personally find that the only way to train in rationality is by doing an unfamiliar activity that requires explicit thought. Examples of unfamiliar activities include:</p><br><p><strong>Meditation:</strong> This was one of the major contributions of Buddhism, both the meditation practice itself and the related idea of enlightenment. The reason for effectiveness is that it is a <em>deliberate</em> exercise for developing your concentration skills; it's a kind of thought exercise that you get <em>exactly</em> the right amount of practice on; and you have to practice in ways that are sufficiently unpleasant to keep you focussed. I think there's a good case that the <em>reason</em> rationality training is effective is because its exercises have this quality of unpleasantness. This isn't a case of rationality being useful for life; it's a case of rationality's being the only way to gain this particular skill for solving problems.</p><br><p>__Mental math: __My dad got me interested in math at a young age, and so I had to learn some very basic stuff early on. This was really useful (though I still occasionally have trouble with a bit of basic algebra). A lot of my friends started to learn math recently, and the reason they're so skilled now is that they had a solid foundation in simple math as kids.</p><br><p><strong>Logic puzzles:</strong> I used to be terrible at logic puzzles. Today I have enough skills that I'm often able to win them by playing on a level playing field with my opponent; the only reason I keep losing is that I'm deliberately playing on a level lower than is optimal for me. This doesn't mean I have <em>learned</em> the skill of logic puzzles, though, because I'm essentially copying past success. My "level" of performance is basically "level" in the sense that a lot of the time I can win by luck but I <em>also</em> know enough about the rules of logic to know when I should give up.</p><br><p>But if I say that I have a certain "rationality" level, that really means that my level of rationality is such that, in general, if someone were to try and train me in rationality, that training would actually <em>improve</em> my ability to solve problems in general, compared to not having this training.</p><br><p>How would rationality training work</p><br><p>In order to train in rationality, a person generally needs a certain amount of time for each <em>instance</em> of rationality training. For example (though the next section will make this more concrete), if a person has to pick 100 words at random, she might get 3 or 4 words in the first try. This isn't because "it takes 3s for 4tth time to get really good"\xe2\x80\x94it's actually because picking words at random doesn't <em>teach</em> you language skills, and in particular it doesn't teach you how long words tend to be. Similarly, there are <em>many</em> good reasons why you might not start off good at math, and so many good reasons why you can't just pick it up on your own, and it's hard to know how much effort to put into each of them. You might be able to improve in this general area with one thing of training (i.e., with one instance of rationality training), but not another (i.e. you can improve at picking words without improving at word length).</p><br><p>In order for rationality training to be an effective way of developing skills for <em>general problem-solving</em>, it needs to consist of a certain <em>specific</em> amount of rationality training with a particular <em>specific</em> amount spent on each instance (i.e.: the time needed to train is less than <em>the</em> time needed to train for a different problem you could be working on). It also needs to involve enough specific practice such that when you <em>do</em> spend that amount of time on a separate problem (that happens to have a good structure), you've already made the investment of time that is necessary to achieve a certain level of rationality.</p><br><p>The point of the mini-sequence will be to introduce an example of the kind of approach you'd actually take to achieve this sort of effectiveness; you won't actually be able to train in rationality in a typical organization because it would be prohibitively costly.</p><br><p>As an example, let's say you wanted to train in "rationality of problem solving." You might have to work on math or logic puzzles, rather than picking words randomly. You might need to train in other areas too, such as improving productivity in general (e.g. practicing using productivity systems) and improving your social skills, so you don't become complacent due to a failure to solve problems.</p><br><p>The amount and type of time for improvement in these areas would be a big part of the "amount to spend on your own rationality." For example, you might have to spend a lot of time to get good at writing, so that you aren't "outshining" everyone else by copying some very successful people (or, alternatively, having a bad time because you can't write as well).</p><br><p>Another example is that a different person might need training in <em>both</em> logic puzzles <em>and</em> coding (as opposed to just one of these). If you want to become a programmer, you will have to train in both skills in order to develop skills in each (i.e.; to become a good rationalist, you need to be a good programmer).</p><br><p>Other activities besides mathematical proofs, puzzles, or words from a random string-generator can also be rationales for training in rationality skills, especially since <em>practice generally improves results</em>. (For example, if you want to improve in writing, you will practice blogging, but you shouldn't <em>practice</em> by writing blogs just for fun, or trying to write good posts right now.)</p><br><p>How would you measure the usefulness of x-risk training for organizational effectiveness? If we want to <em>really</em> develop good outcomes out of a group of rationalists, it will require <em>some</em> amount of training, but we know what to <em>do</em> with that training once it's been accomplished.</p><br><p>Training is a bit of a overhead</p><br><p>Rationality training is not all that valuable if you're an organization trying to accomplish other things. For example, you probably <em>can't</em> just have each employee do one day of rationality training for improving their problem solving, so maybe your group should focus on other training for improving organizational effectiveness.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
