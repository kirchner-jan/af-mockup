<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul><br><p>In one of the most important posts of the last two months, Robin Hanson offers a model for why we have such a difficult time agreeing on how much to help one another. I think the model offers an obvious reason for why so many people would benefit from more charity and fewer regulations \xe2\x80\x94 we would be able to help each other out more with money and energy if we agreed how much of each each other's gains to split.</p><br><p>To the best of my understanding, this is a completely novel perspective to most in the rationality community. Robin points out in the Post that <em>Eliezer's response has been rather glib</em>: <em>"Let's not talk about how you should spend your money, or even the existence of morality. If you want something done, either do it yourself, or learn to live with not-doing-it.". _So here is a big question for the community: Why don't I see people thinking more than </em>"what should I do with my money?"<em> and instead </em>"how can I benefit from what others choose to do with their money?"_.</p><br><p>Here's Robin Hanson's theory: <em>"When two people trade with each other and each of them cares about the other, then the interaction is great. But when neither of them cares about each other, and everyone has their own interests that are more specific to them, then the interaction can be very bad indeed."</em>.</p><br><p>So how do we get it right this time around? Let's find out.</p><br><p>Acknoledgements</p><br><p>I would like to thank Scott Alexander, the LessWrong team, all the people who have thanked me in the past and people who I've just talked with a moment and the time I spent on writing this article, I'm sure there are a few more I may have forgotten to mention.</p><br><p>The Interview</p><br><p>Why do we have such an hard time agreeing on...?</p><br><p>__Robin Hanson: __Let's start with a simple model to illustrate some possible causes of disagreements. Maybe you and I both really want a nice new car. Maybe I want to spend a few million on getting a nice, comfortable new home. Maybe you want to go for a car with a lot of leg room so you can sit for a lot of nice, comfortable afternoons in the back seat. So let's assume that I have an extra $5,000 lying around, and what I want to do with it is buy a car. Maybe you don't like spending money, and think that as long as I want to give you something, you're good.</p><br><p>Or maybe you think $5,000 is an amount too small to bother with, and that if I let you choose at random how I get to spend it, you'd make the choice that makes the biggest difference to your utility (which would be to spend it on a new car). And if we both make these choices independently, then it's 50-50. But if there was some way to predict your decision with an accuracy of 90%+, and my decision with an accuracy 90%+, then I'd know that if I spent $5,000, I probably wouldn't end up spending any more on a car. So instead, when I'm deciding to spend $5,000 in the first place, I can make a guess at whether it would make an extra difference to your utility to know about it beforehand, and so I don't tell you about it until I know if it makes a difference to your utility.</p><br><p>Or here's a slightly more complicated version. Maybe you and me both want to buy a home. Maybe, from my perspective, it costs $200,000, and my housemates and I will each make $6,000 extra a year on the deal. Maybe for you your house's value is worth $300,000, with a 10% chance you'll get a $20,000 bonus and my housemates will get another $6,000 if you buy your house. We both get good deals from you knowing about the extra money in front of you and from your housemates.</p><br><p>But if we decide that we all just want to do things on the basis of the best deals for all of us, then it ends up being a 50-50 split on value of my housemates' income and of ours. Maybe I like having my housemates think we have a large amount of extra income coming in, and so I would be happier if you buy your own house than if I don't know if you'd already spent our extra income on one. And maybe you would feel that way too. But if we end up spending money on the house and the housemates don't know the extra $6,000 we're spending because I didn't tell them, the money ends up being split 50-50 between us.</p><br><p>In any case, here's the basic model I'm using to try to explain why people spend so much of their time being grumpy and upset about the decisions the other person has made. Let's talk more about that.</p><br><p>The Robin Hanson model</p><br><p>First, before starting the interview, I want to take a moment to point out the obvious: these sorts of models just don't work at the individual level. If it's like choosing between $6,000 and a nice car, everyone gets the nice car. But if your housemates would spend a $20,00 bonus on a new car if you bought a new car, then no matter how "good" you think your decision is, you're going to be taking part in a good deal with your housemates, and if you can help your housemates get a good deal that's going to make you more "win" than if you don't tell them about the bonus.</p><br><p>It's a <em>lot</em> harder to explain an argument if you only speak to the person one time. And that's exactly what Robin has been modeling. Two people aren't playing a zero-sum game between them, they're playing a strategy game where each person wants to get the most reward with less cost. But that strategy gets harder to work as you add the other person. Here's the same argument at a group level:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>__Robin Hanson: __If you and I both have 50% chance of getting a new car and you don't tell me what you plan to do with the $5k. If I have a chance to know you're planning to buy a new car, it will make sense for me to let you know, and I'll know I'm giving you a good bet, and you'll know I'd rather just take the $6k that you're not spending. So if you don't plan on telling me what to do with my $5k, the cost of you finding out is the same as just letting me find it somewhere I can play it back. And since it doesn't cost you much in terms of money, the benefit is that I won't guess if you plan on not telling me what you plan on doing with the money.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This argument works with money and with time. The problem is that your housemates would expect you to do lots of trades with them for money and time, and if you decide that this trade is "stupid" and you decide you just want to keep the money that actually counts, they will feel you are making a "bad deal" for them by not making the trades they expect. So a third way to break the argument might be to not give money or time to your housemates at all, and let your decision on whether to spend the money or your time be completely determined by your decision to spend the money on something or on not spending it on something.</p><br><p>This is obviously not a sensible option for any real-world person. But let's play along a little. Is it actually possible to spend money making someone else lose out in situations where you can just not spend the money? Is the above argument still sound after we play along, and if so, how might it look at the group level? To give you some examples:</p><br><p>Robin's argument applies to any case where you have some money, or time to spend, and your potential trade partner has no use for the money or the time, but would prefer you to not have the money or not have the time even if he's got no use for it.</p><br><p>If you think that this argument is sound, imagine you are giving a talk at an Oxford conference and two men decide to give the talk after an evening of drinks. Maybe one of them is gay and doesn't want to risk rejection. Maybe both of them just think talking about the conference in a loud pub is better than giving a talk to a conference full of gay men. There's going to be nothing you can do about the money that these guys spend on the bar, or the fact that you would be happier not giving the talk, because as far as anyone else is concerned that money and time is just gone.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
