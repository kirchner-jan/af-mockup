</ul><br><p>I want to discuss some trading strategies that I've found very profitable. These are <em>not _my own, but they all come directly from books on trading written by professional professionals. I won't go into depth about these because the vast majority of you can do it if you're interested. This post is more about what _not</em> to do.</p><br><p>What do I mean by "a trading strategy"?</p><br><p>When I call them trading strategies I mean something that can be done using a single computer program. There are no back room operators that you have to go inside and see something before you get your money back. The market trades automatically and you have no reason to be there at the time the exchange occurs. You can even get paid for sitting around waiting for that exchange to occur in that market, and you have no way to influence the outcome. If you're wrong, you lose your money, that's it.</p><br><p>Note that you don't necessarily have to do all the trading on your own computer. You can get the benefit of trading by hiring anyone you trust. But you can't be an institutional investor because then you have to hold the assets of the clients over the entire lifespan of your strategy, and that can be very long.</p><br><p>The word "trading" refers to many different strategies that are all called trading strategies, but they are very different things. I will cover some of the ones that you'll have encountered before, like "putting on a trade based on news or a news tweet" or the thing where you hear about these newfangled trading algorithms with very short time horizons being used by hedge funds and so you get a little twitch of annoyance while you're on their website or something. And then you learn <em>how</em> they trade and it's <em>not</em> going to work for you so you give up on that strategy.</p><br><p>What are these strategies called?"</p><br><p>These are called <em>active</em> or <em>scalping</em> strategies. You either short-sell <em>all</em> of the market in some market or you long-sell _all _of the market in some other market. When you hear about the latest active trading algorithm from a hedge fund (that short-sells some market and/\xe2\x80\x8bor does some timing) you can usually conclude that it is some combination of these two strategies. If the time horizon is even shorter, that is. Most of the news trading algorithms I know of use very short time horriions.</p><br><p>More in depth advice:</p><br><p>For most people that would be too hard to keep up with, unless you're already a regular reader of this site or otherwise knowledgeable in technical finance, and you don't even mind being a little out-of-the-know. I suggest that you do some basic research first. And then read one of the books on trading, like The Five-Hour Trader (by Michael L. Howard). The book will have <em>many</em> sections that talk about <em>why</em> what you're doing doesn't work, such as this:</p><br><p>"Why don't I put a stop loss on each trade to limit losses? If I do, I'll never get rich because I'll always be down by the stop loss as long as I'm trading. Why do I need this stop loss? It's just a limit order on the market, I need one! What if I don't have Internet access and I can't log on to the exchange to change my stop loss. That's unacceptable! What if the market is halted or suspended?"</p><br><p>If you're really smart you can read one chapter, do all the things on the advice, and read another chapter and think that they have something in common when they don't, but I would not be shocked to be proven wrong about this. If you're less smart you probably will not be successful at trading (or at least not very successful), and if you are successful but you haven't gotten rich, well, I'm not really sure I can help you with that one.</p><br><p>How to choose stocks?</p><br><p>This is a bit of a mouthful. If you understand the terms of an individual trade you don't need to know anything <em>beyond that</em> to decide whether to accept or reject it. If you don't know what the terms of a trade are, the book will cover that but if you <em>do</em> know what the terms are, I don't know how you can make these decisions. It's the <em>overall strategy</em> that matters.</p><br><p>In any case, the basic idea is simple. You think up a strategy that you expect would work, come up with some math that proves that it will work, write up the terms of the trade and, given that the terms of the underlying trade can only go in one direction, what you do with them is already decided.</p><br><p>More details:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>Suppose that for each day t=0,..., T-1 we have a random variable (RV) that is either N or 1. We also have a set of stock prices S. On each day t we may either buy some RV=1 stocks at some price S1t or sell RV=1 stocks to some price S2t. The purchase is done on the condition that RV=1, the price of the purchase is S1t=RV=1, and the RV becomes N with probability \xce\xb3t=1\xe2\x88\x92exp(\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb3t) of each passing day t. The sale is done on the RV=N condition, the price of that is S=N\xe2\x88\x92(t+1)\xe2\x88\x92t.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>In plain English this means that if you buy a stock, its price goes up. If you buy it at $100 and it goes up to $110, the stock now "belongs to" you. If the price goes down to $90, the stock "belongs" to the "owner" of that stock. Let's say "owner" means "the person who bought the stock first".</p><br><p>If someone wants to buy the stock, they will ask you to give them $100. To make the math easier, and to make it look more like your bank account statement, let's say your bank account statement "belongs to you" and if you ever lose it, "someone else" gets it.</p><br><p>To calculate a successful strategy, you need to find the parameters T, \xce\xb3, S. You need them so that whenever you buy it for $100, the price goes up to $106, but whenever you sell it for $104, the price gets $103. You also need to know who is the "owner" when it "becomes" theirs.</p><br><p>The basic idea is that if your strategy succeeds, your bank account statement will get "more value" than it did as soon as you made the trade. Every day, a single stock will be "owned" by a person but it is "bought" by you and "sold" by that person. This means that you get back the last day's value as soon as you can, and as soon as you lose that value, someone else gets it.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
