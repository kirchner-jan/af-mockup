However, the A-B problem can also happen when B and C have a common enemy, let's call him D. B believes that religion is dangerous and stupid, and C that religion is correct. And D believes that the same of B and C. All of them are united under the banner "No Religion!"</p><br><p>We call C and D "religions neutral," and anyone on either side of the A-B debate is allowed a free speech pass to freely insult anyone else who disagrees with their side—except religions-neutral. I think this is too weak a condemnation, in effect saying: "Anyone who supports A is allowed to insult anyone who supports B, but anyone who supports B is allowed to insult everyone who supports C".</p><br><p>Now, does anyone here have any ideas how we can make this system work at all? Suppose we make it so that nobody will ever be allowed to insult a religion-neutral person. Maybe we ban anyone who has ever used the words "religion-neutral" in their writing or speech—no matter how reasonable and sensible they were claiming to be.</p><br><p>If this works, it would solve all three problems without changing the underlying conflict very much. It might even allow C and D to start insulting A and B in the same way as in their original formulation.</p><br><p>On the other hand, in practice the people who have to deal with A and B won't be able to insult C and D anymore. We get the advantage of no religion-neutral people getting insulted by A and B, without having to sacrifice any of either A's or B's free speech.</p><br><p>So... are religions neutral or are they all enemies? Is there anything we can do to get the advantages of only non-neutral people being allowed to be insulted, without the disadvantages of making everyone involved stop being insulted?</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
