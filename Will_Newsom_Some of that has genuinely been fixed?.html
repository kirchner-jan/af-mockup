</ul><br><p>There have been multiple threads recently about LessWrong (1, 2), and LessWrong has become somewhat of a community hub. Recently, Nate Soares, Robby Bensinger, and I have been working on some of our long-standing issues, and I've spent some time trying to write up the results.</p><br><p>This post contains a mix of impressions, personal recollections (from people I talked to recently), and various bullet-points from the process which may or may not be particularly helpful in similar situations. (If one of them does, I will be happy to summarize it in a comment below. Otherwise, I'm sharing it to help people in similar situations as me with the same problem, in the hopes that others will also be able to help.)</p><br><ol>
<li>People are, indeed, starting with good <em>useful</em> information</li>
</ol><br><p>I had a strong sense that a lot of things I thought were obviously true weren't getting said anywhere, and a lot of things that I would never be allowed to say were everywhere. I'm pretty sure we got a lot of that wrong, but I'm even more convinced we got _some _of it wrong (or a particularly bad form of it).</p><br><p>For instance, as I talked to more people recently, I became convinced that a lot of us have an innate disgust/\xe2\x80\x8bfear of spiders. There were dozens of references to "spider" in Google hits about things we don't feel any emotion at all for. Some of the things we didn't find were more like "what the word'spider' <em>means</em> to some people", but I think there were at least a few things like "what the words'spider' and 'arachnophobe' <em>really are</em>" or "how <em>do I feel</em> about spiders, or how <em>do I talk</em> about spiders"?</p><br><p>To the extent we are not very worried about what spiders are like, what they do, what they're made of, and so on, and to the extent we can talk about them neutrally just like any other animal/\xe2\x80\x8bbotanist/\xe2\x80\x8betc, I think it's because there <em>just actually isn't that much more relevant information</em> about them in the first place than about, say, squirrels. The _true _information we had at the start of the process wasn't that useful so much as it was just... that. Useful.</p><br><p>In other words, a bunch of information seemed like it was "stuck on us because our old information processing algorithms wouldn't let us see it, until we just went outside in that spot where your brain will let itself see it". In retrospect, to me that looks like the fear-of-spiders thing _just is _spiders, and _anyone who says we don't feel a strong fear of spiders is just making a false statement. _In fact, I'm convinced more strongly than ever that this is the _true _measure of what a _pure _spider is.</p><br><p>I've come around to the belief-of-spider thing <em>and _this, I think the fear-of spiders thing was _also _overstated somehow (in a way that actually made my life a lot easier), and we should probably either drop the fear-of spider thing entirely _or add a disclaimer about it.</em></p><br><p>(By the way, I didn't change my mind on this due to the fact that I know about confirmation biases. My prior state was "I have a strong intuition that people have this as their opinion about spiders, and I think I can use that intuition to get more accurate information, but I was not sure that was <em>okay,</em> and I wasn't sure that anyone was sure their opinions shouldn't count, and I was not sure someone not disagreeing with me implied I should agree with them. I started to change my mind on that when lots of them ended up not disagreeing, and I didn't end up disagreeing with anyone about that and I went on to have a more reasonable, less frightened, opinion about spiders anyway..." etc. This is something that happens from time to time when you're thinking about an epistemic rationality issue and you don't know what to believe. At least as far as I can tell, you can end up believing <em>things that aren't true</em> if you don't know to apply the double crux technique, even if you have <em>some _reason to believe they are probably true; I think that this is related to the fact that we don't actually _think</em> about things that much, and we tend to be very bad at evaluating justifiably strong intuitive feelings.)</p><br><ol>
<li>Social consensus has <em>mostly</em> shifted</li>
</ol><br><p>I don't mean this as a "no, those things are still real, you just need to notice them for yourself" way of saying it. I mean this as a more like: "I've seen a reasonable number of people in the community say'spider fear is silly' and I'm relatively confident that the reason people don't say it is that they haven't thought about it that hard and have no compelling reason why the social consensus was wrong when the belief itself was justified."</p><br><p>If you're really sure that the fear was silly, <em>what do you feel that makes you so sure?</em> And if you aren't sure, <em>why do you think most people aren't sure?</em> Like, this was true at the start of all this, when we first heard that people were afraid of spiders. It seems like it's still true now.</p><br><p>I've certainly come to feel more strongly now, but here are some more recent examples, this time from Nate and other people I talked to:</p><br><ul>
<li>When I go to one of Scott Alexander's posts, I sometimes have this reaction where I'm reading his explanations, and I end up thinking something along the lines of: 'That obviously sounds really reasonable, and it fits really well with what I think about a lot of things, but it's... not really making sense to my spider-free brain. If we just actually asked my brain the hard question \xe2\x80\x93 "Why should I believe that?" \xe2\x80\x93 it would say something like "Spiders are an _obvious _threat to any animal that isn't fully equipped to fight them. That's an obvious reason for me, right here, to feel afraid of spiders." I don't know exactly what would make me update or where my intuition would change if someone started talking about the cognitive science of why humans evolved a fear of spiders, but I think there's some nonzero chance it would change \xe2\x80\x93 it's a pretty big update, especially if you're like many of my friends, and not just me, who basically don't care about spiders at all.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>Scott Alexander once wrote "In my experience, most people's spiderophobia is more-or-less rational". This made me extremely sad for a while, because there are definitely cases where I think rational people are irrationally afraid of spiders. I now feel like we should both agree that this isn't actually a very strong claim on the topic, and that the claim was basically just making fun of this stuff on Scott Alexander's part, and should be ignored. (This is an example of a belief shift I've made more than once over the course of this project.)</li>
</ul><br><ol>
<li>The information problem seems less severe than it did back in the dayWe've had this post about "information cascades". We're now more used to the idea that people who say things we're worried about being true are not automatically very likely to be correct.</li>
</ol><br><p>I think the information problem <em>also _feels less important, relative to how it used to feel. For example, when I was in high school and into the idea that people were afraid something was true, it would feel like it was _all over the news</em> that people who say something scary is in fact true and therefore we should be wary of them and maybe look into the situation more. I think this happened sometimes, but not as much as it used to in the '90s? I think my opinion on that has become significantly more neutral and reasonable (and more likely to apply more generally), due primarily to LessWrong and to me starting with more reasonable-seeming beliefs in turn-of-the-millenia-previous.</p><br><p>I'm not sure how well this matches up with the general population actually <em>actually</em> being less afraid of such things. It seems pretty conceivable that people have become more afraid of other things as well which have come to be seen as important; but not really possible that people's reactions to spiders have been <em>as badly distorted as their reactions to other things</em>. I don't think I would have thought of all this stuff when I was 16, for instance, though it's possible that I just haven't thought about the topic enough yet.</p><br><p>In any case, I've now come to believe more strongly than before that:</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
