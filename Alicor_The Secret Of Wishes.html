Sometimes we add in "if" or "if [circumstance X] then [magic]," or sometimes "a wish from the gods" or "if only I knew how to think the right thoughts". The usual form of the wish is of the type "Make me a pixie!" because they're easy to remember and also because we know what pixies look like, and they're nice. But if you haven't seen a list, you can add more wishes if you like\xe2\x80\x94the exact same pattern has been found in lists of what-wish-and-you-would-be-able ("Make me a doctor!" "Make me a house!"), and it's also been found in other people's fantasies ("Make a handsome prince fall in love with me!" "Make Robin the hero of my dreams!").  You can describe things you'd like ("Make me a millionaire so I can stop living at home!" "Make us a happy couple!") and also dreams ("Make my sister a princess!" "Make us into millionaires so we can move to California!").  Some things you would want, but not very many; in our fantasy lives the most difficult things to wish for are the ones that would cause us the least obvious problems, the ones that would mean the least disruption to our daily routines, or the ones that would be less obvious to others, so they're unlikely to happen. So often, what people wish for (in fantasy, in daydreams that never go anywhere) makes perfect sense, but it seems completely useless in real life.</p><br><p>Why, oh why, do people think about this stuff the way they do?</p><br><p>One might say, "You don't think your wish is magical, so it's not magical!"  But "Make my nose look good" and "Make my brother into a rockstar" are both magic. So the answer is somewhere between:  "<em>I don't think about it because it's not magic, but I can't think of anything else to wish for, so I wish this thing that doesn't seem like a coincidence and I'm not thinking of some other one, so now I have a wish and it is magic</em>" and:  "<em>It just has to be magic. Anything that isn't magic must be a coincidence.</em>"</p><br><p>The answer seems to be:  Wishes tend to be associated with things that seem more interesting, or at least more relevant to the problem at hand, than the things you ordinarily think of when you think of "wishes" ("Make me a lawyer!").  For those things, the feeling of "wish" is closer to "I could be doing something more meaningful to live up to that wish, because what I'm <em>actually</em> doing keeps bringing me down\xe2\x80\x94doing meaningful things, trying to find ways to make my life better, etc. would not actually make me feel better, but at least it would bring me closer to living up to that wish."  If I didn't feel like there was anything more interesting I could wish for, the whole phenomenon might be a coincidence.</p><br><p>Maybe we all think this way. If so, what about the people who would wish for "A wish from the gods?", or "A wish from someone who isn't even around", or "I wish for to be on the winning team".  Aren't those magical wishes? Maybe a wish for a wish is also a magical one. Maybe we shouldn't try to be rational about wishes we can't take action on. And maybe wishing in general is a sort of proto-rationality\xe2\x80\x94at least, we do it all the time without trying to be rational about it.</p><br><p>Let's break down the process and see where we're mistaken.</p><br><p>What's going on, on some sub-experiential level, when you think of a wish? Not only your brain's abstract representation of it, not even your conscious intentions to make it, but something more like a feeling of wishing or will-ingness. We could imagine this as a sort of <em>intentionality</em>, on a lower level of organization than intentions themselves. In fact, we could even say that your brain's desire-wanting system is an extension of your conscious mind's intentions system, on a lower layer of representation. You might even call this the "Wish Alignment Theory" or what we're going to call "Wishful Thinking".  "Intentionality" could be taken as a synonym for "pattern of intentionality", but you could make it less vague and say something like "The pattern our internal representations create when we think about something, the way our representations think about something".  We can say that our internal representations match up well enough with each other to create this feeling that we call "wishing" or "willing" when our consciousness, perhaps with the help of the working memory, represents something as worth more attention or further consideration than our conscious intentions, but the representations aren't always the same as that which is more often represented.</p><br><p>And so wishing itself is an intentional pattern in the brain, a sort of a wish or desire or preference, and this pattern is matched to what we experience as that which we want; and if this pattern is strong enough, then we experience as able to take action, or that we can take action\xe2\x80\x94but not so strongly that the wish actually is effective and the action is taken. In fact, the stronger this pattern is, the less capable we're likely to be of actually taking action on our conscious wish. The more we have a wish to have things some particular way, but we feel incapable of doing something about it, the more likely it is that we just aren't <em>ready</em> to take a particular action. In other words:  You may find that it has little apparent impact when you decide to have a belief to the effect of "Make my nose less jowly!", but then you get on a plane with your husband and the next thing you know you're at the airport. Not only did you have a belief that made you more likely to do something in the future, believing your belief made future-you more likely to actually go through with the plan.</p><br><p>The way that wishes work is through this intentional pattern thingy. And the way our brains match up this intentional pattern thing thingy to what we wish, is the same way any two things matched up in our physical world, or to use a metaphor from the Rationality post, the way that two billiard balls seem to be in physical contact whenever they are nearby. Or, more precisely, you have the intentional pattern as a belief, which you can then also think about the same way you think about anything else that's a belief, like "I believe my watch is 9:45 am", and then your brain notices that the belief-in-believers-narrative seems in some way connected to your perception of what it actually is to be you. That connection may happen on a conscious level, or it may happen without your ever realizing it, the connection may be completely subconscious\xe2\x80\x94it matters that you're aware of it, because then you can use the association between the belief and your conscious experience as an intention to create a new belief in future-you that will be connected to what you perceive as your ability to take action about your wish, the same way that belief in belief-in-beings-of-belief leads to a conscious belief in the future-us.</p><br><p>Do other things have intensions? What if you're not even consciously aware when you have that feeling of wanting something? This one will make us feel a little bit more confused. Are you really missing the point about consciousness and self-awareness and intentionality if, when you dream, you can become aware of something that feels more like a wish than a thought, and you can become attached to it as a sort of a feeling of self? If "wishing feels like a feeling of self" is actually the same thing as "I wish for that thing to happen", it becomes easier to imagine a similar type of intentional pattern that could be matched to what one feels is an intention to go back and re-experience an old one. This, if it leads to a belief in self (by itself) could be a "true" intention that can make wishes actually happen. For instance, if you have an intention to "Make me a lawyer!", a feeling of wishing for it may make you think of what it <em>feels like</em>, and then you may come up with the conscious representation of a belief attached to this:  "Yes, I have an intention! I'm going to be a lawyer!"  If this belief in belief in your intention leads to an intention of believing, "The belief is true! The belief is the truth!", then maybe believing your belief in believing can make things happen anyway\xe2\x80\x94after all, things are what we make them!</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
