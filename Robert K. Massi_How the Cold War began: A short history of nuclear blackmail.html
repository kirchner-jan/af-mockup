In a 1988 Russian-language study of U.S. foreign policy in the twentieth century, Mark Aldrich describes a similar pact made in 1947, two years before the end of the Cold War: the Czech Republic and Slovakia stopped shortening the range of their missiles to match those of the United States.2 Thus, while the original intention of the agreement was to stop Soviet nuclear weapons tests at a safe distance in exchange for American non-weapon testing, the American side rejected this in 1947, and the Soviet Union broke off relations with the Czechs in 1948, just as it was negotiating with the United States. Aldrich also mentions a nuclear non-aggregation pact made under the direction of Stalin that seems to be the only precedent for Soviet-led attempts at nuclear cooperation.</p><br><p>I will go into more detail in the next essay on the history of the Soviet Union's attempts to acquire nuclear-weapons-capable missiles, but the Pact of 1947 did not go unnoticed, and in 1948 a joint US-USSR resolution passed at the UN called for an international conference on atomic energy, in which both the Czech and Slovakia blocs and the United States signed onto a statement in support of the treaty. The United States agreed to host this conference as long as Czechoslovakia and Slovakia didn't sign. This was the beginning (so it seems to me) of Soviet-USA diplomatic warfare: each superpower threatening to nuke the other's city if the other did not give in, the other refusing, and each threatening to nuke both if they did not give in.3</p><br><p>Of course, the Soviet Union was not yet an atomic nuclear power, so to get around the limitation of the Partial Test Ban treaty, the Soviets decided to use a tactic in conventional warfare that had helped them win the Soviet-Afghan War against the much richer and much more powerful Western nations: they would make a credible threat with overwhelming force of a preemptive nuclear strike. If a Western nation refused to give in under any condition, and Soviet missiles could strike any major US city from Russia, the Soviet Union would be able to deter (and, if necessary, win) a western invasion of Russia by launching a devastating first strike from the Soviet Union, whose warheads would remain in the air for days, or even weeks, flying from Russian silos. In 1946, in the same year the Czechs and Slovaks signed their nuclear non-agglement pact, the British and French signed a similar international treaty, banning all types of nuclear weapons and military research for ten years. While the Soviets, as we'll soon see, signed off on the treaty, the rest of the world did not. </p><br><p>One of the advantages of this tactic of threat was that it had the further advantage. Though few today realize how important it was, at one point the threat of Soviet nuclear war, whether preemptive or retaliatory, was as credible as, if not more credible than, the threat of an American first strike.4 Just as with the deterrent of the Cold War, the Soviet pre-emptive and retaliatory weapons prevented the United States from ever using atomic weapons against the Soviet Union. </p><br><p>Thus, when the United Nations General Assembly began to discuss the issue of Soviet arms control to reduce the risk of a Soviet first strike, the United States used its Security Council veto power against the proposal in a series of resolutions to prevent the arms control treaties from ever being implemented. At the same time, Britain and France used similar diplomatic maneuvers to prevent nuclear arms control from being enacted in their own countries as well.</p><br><p>The Soviets, of course, did everything that they could to comply with the Partial Test Ban, but as it happened, the treaty was flawed in a way that would ultimately affect the relationship between the USSR and the United States.</p><br><p>The Partial Test Ban, it will be remembered, would ban all types of weapons and weapon test explosions over water anywhere on the globe, _except _for weapons launched from submarines. The Soviets had a massive advantage, since all their weapons could be launched from submarine bases; but in order to launch a weapon from submarines, the Soviet Union must traverse a very narrow corridor of ocean. In a series of naval parries, the Soviets had been able to claim that their submarine weapons were within their own national borders and not subject to American control. In other words, while it was a violation of the treaty for a nuclear power to launch a missile from beneath the sea, it wasn't a violation for a nuclear power, like France or Britain, to set up a base beneath the sea. The United States pointed this out several years after the treaty was signed, and the Soviets responded that the treaty "has no effect on the control and supervision of nuclear submarine launched missiles."5</p><br><p>So the Soviets signed on to the Partial Test Ban but left out a part that would have done serious damage to the Soviet-U.S. nuclear war scenario.</p><br><p><strong>II.</strong></p><br><p>How did the Soviets come to make such an extraordinary claim? Here's how I trace the story, and what I think the history tells us instead.</p><br><p>In 1962, the Soviets sent some of their missiles underground.6 This was to comply with the terms of the Partial Test Banner Treaty of 1963, in which they agreed to give up 20% of their actual missile range in exchange for 10% of the total range of their missiles, but to remain able to launch a first strike with 90% of their actual range, which would be enough for the destruction of a substantial number of western cities, including the Pentagon. In other words the Soviet Union signed off on this, which in turn is what allowed the United States (and Britain and France) to begin construction of underground storage facilities for nuclear weapons in the United States, Britain, and France, respectively, and thus begin to solve the so-called "missile gap" with the Soviet Union. The missiles that the Soviet Union placed underground were capable of being launched by both its large missile submarines and its medium-range mobile launchers, which could carry four nuclear warheads and have a 200-mile range. The missiles that America and Europe put underground were capable only of being launched from submarine bases, and thus contained only two warheads.</p><br><p>And then, in 1963, as the partial test ban was being negotiated, as the Soviets were becoming more desperate to get an additional treaty, and as the United States was preparing to put underground nuclear storage facilities on its own soil, a series of false alarms threatened the end of the Partial Test ban treaty.</p><br><p>On September 25th of that same year, the Soviet Union successfully launched a missile that was in violation of the terms of the treaty, a medium-range mobile launch that could only be launched from beneath the sea. While it wasn't technically a first strike, it was a dangerous escalation of the strategic nuclear standoff that must have worried the other leaders at the United Nations that night, who were debating whether or not to approve, as the United States began construction of underground nuclear bomb storage facilities designed to shelter all of the first-strike nuclear arsenals the United States, Italy, France, and the Soviet union were said to have.</p><br><p>The following day, at a meeting of the United Nations General assembly the Soviet Union was granted a reprieve\xe2\x80\x94one of the most significant defuses of the Cold War. The resolution that was passed on the 25th of September 1963, at the meeting of the United National General Assembly, at the meeting, however, of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, on the 27th of September 1963.7 The resolution called for all member states to refrain from using nuclear weapons or other forms of war against each other during the negotiations of a future test ban treaty.8</p><br><p>That same resolution then recommended the establishment of an arms control commission, which would recommend arms control measures to the Parties to the Partial Test Banner treaty, including the withdrawal of forces that might otherwise be used to retaliate against an attack and the establishment of an early warning system to detect and deter an attack. It called for the signing of the treaty by all states in a very clear statement that, though it recommended an arms control commission and arms control measures, it did not impose any obligations on any state. It called for inspections. It called for economic reliefs, including food and energy aid. It called for technical assistance. It called for a report on military uses of hydrogen.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
