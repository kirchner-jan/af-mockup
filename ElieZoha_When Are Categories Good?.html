(I would not be surprised if they can reach an understanding by going back and forth for weeks, rather than a single day)</p><br><p>But then what is this X that A doesn't think is a Y? When is it a Y, and when is it not a Y? This is in some sense the underlying problem of the entire question. And we could call this the meta-problems of a specific sub question. (For example, we could use: when does X have qualities that are more likely to bring Y as a whole, or when has X qualities that can be more independent of the whole)</p><br><p>We will call this the meta question.</p><br><p>In our example, the meta question could be "when a topic is a common property of X that is also known to have Y, do you think that X should be thought of as a Y?" Or "when a topic would be a common property of a topic, do you think it should be thought of?" or "When X has some properties to do with Y, do you have a higher probability of thinking of X in the context of a Y vs. not-a-Y?" </p><br><p>We assume that to some extent, a topic is a topic, because it's a Y, and to some extent it's not because it's not a Y, therefore the answer to this question will appear to be "sometimes, but not always".</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
