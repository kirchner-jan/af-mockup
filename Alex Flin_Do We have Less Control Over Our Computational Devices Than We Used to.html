For example, we are more used to the idea that human beings can fly and drive cars than we are used to the idea of a human being being able to use tools to build things at the push of a button. Indeed, most of us would consider either to be a bizarre notion. Yet the trend can be seen throughout history that technological innovation has, in general, allowed humans to make their lives better rather than worse. Perhaps we should be less surprised by the latter result.</p><br><p><em>Introduction:</em></p><br><p>It seems to me that there is one specific area where technology has provided enormous power to us, and this is in the domain of our use of computational devices. We live in a world where modern technology puts us in direct control over all aspects of our environment at the push of buttons. In other words, our ability to exert control over our world has dramatically increased over time. For the vast majority of human history, our ability to influence our world in large part depended on natural, physical force. The ability to push buttons and build things from scratch has put us in direct control of so much of the world that most of us would hardly be able to imagine life very different from what it is.</p><br><p>On the other hand, there exists also a trend in the literature on technology and society. That trend holds that as technology has improved and allowed greater control over our devices, our ability to think about and control technology has been increasingly overwhelmed by our tendency to think about and use technology. An example of this phenomenon, which is referred to as <em>technological determinism</em>, can be found in D. Coase's excellent essay <em>What Is 'The Law of the Jungle?'.</em> In Coase's words:</p><br><blockquote>
<p>When [pre-industrial] humans dealt with scarcity they were limited by what was immediately available to be used \xe2\x80\x93 either because the raw material was scarce or because the process of transformation was difficult. These conditions were sufficiently common so that human responses were highly similar in kind. Their responses also fell within the boundaries of human experience. Thus in the absence of any unusual technological change all were compelled to recognize the importance of the problem and to formulate similar recommendations.</p>
</blockquote><br><p>This is a somewhat remarkable claim, but Coase is not the only one to make similar arguments. For example, in <em>The Economics of Common Pool Resources Before and After Regulation</em> and <em>Essays in Memory of John B. Sayre</em>, William Ellsworth Barbour suggests that the regulation of rivers and water projects by early public utility companies was not very different from the regulation of rivers conducted by any of the private firms operating in the area. The fact that such firms had been operating for so long without any obvious problem gave rise to a very similar consensus about the best response.</p><br><p>Indeed, so broad is the consensus that economists have been quite willing to accept that there is an important connection between the regulation of certain kinds of technologies and the adoption of best practice for those technologies. And that the latter conclusion is the very consequence of the former.</p><br><p>The same seems to apply with respect to the issue of technological growth. In his very interesting book <em>The Economics of Growth</em>, Robert Gordon argues that the trend of technological growth being gradually superseded by more technological growth is not surprising. We would expect that as the technology to increase economic growth has improved, so should the technology to increase growth in the use of such technology. If this pattern of growth were to continue, we would expect the total amount of growth and technology in the economy as a whole to remain stagnant or even decline. Yet Robert Gordon argues that it does not. He provides a long series of examples.</p><br><p>How exactly does this dynamic play out? One simple possibility, and the simplest one, is that we make decisions about the use of new technologies at the level of nations rather than individuals. As technology becomes more powerful and allows new capabilities to be deployed, there is a greater incentive to deploy them. Indeed, perhaps many times more powerful than an individual. In the process, nation-states make choices about the degree in which we can be left to govern our machines without intervention and to determine for ourselves how our world works. We continue to create the laws. However, now they are just the law, and nations may not find it convenient for them to act on their own judgments about how to respond to a particular problem. That being the case, the nation's choices become increasingly constrained by the choices that had previously made by private interests such as those based on economics. The result is that the nation-state takes on many of the characteristics of the corporation.</p><br><p>But perhaps we should be more surprised that nation-states have managed to hold on over time than that they have not.</p><br><p>In this article, I want to explore a related possibility, namely that we should be less likely to think about and act on the issue of human control over technology than we otherwise used to. Such a possibility would be implied by both Barbour's arguments and Gordon's, but Barbour's arguments make the connection very explicitly and clearly, while Gordon's arguments rely more on common sense. Thus, in Barbour's view, it seems more natural that human decisions are at the level of a nation-state than a corporation. That is, a nation-state should be assumed to operate in accordance with the law of economics as opposed to, "the law of the jungle." And while it seems clear enough why it might have been thought that human decisions are better made at the level of an individual, it does not seem obvious that such a level is more fundamental than the one at which nation-states operate. In fact, even those who agree with a distinction between individual and country level should object to a distinction between the two as fundamental. It seems quite plausible, for example, to suggest that the same process that led to a nation-state at the level of humans also leads to one at the level of machines.</p><br><p>But more to the point, we should not find Barbour's view so compelling, nor should we be so surprised if it is. For the very same reason that we are much more used to the notion that a human being can fly than we are used the notion that humans can walk on water, we should be much more used to an argument that a nation-state (at the level of machines) can than a nation-state of humans (at the level as nations). Perhaps we should be more suspicious of the notion that a nation (at the level humans) can do better than a nation (at a higher level of organization such as corporations or nation-states).</p><br><p>_Introduction: _</p><br><p>Consider the question: when human beings used to interact with their environment, to what degree did they have a measure or agency in the world around them? The degree of agency that they had and the extent to which they acted upon that agency seems to have been a function of how physical and other characteristics of themselves and the world around them were correlated. For example, if you were stronger than people around you and could take over your world, you would be more likely to do so. Similarly, if people around you had higher fertility, more wealth, or more friends, it would be easier for you to take over your world.</p><br><p>The question remains, how did all this play out between human beings and their environment? In the ancestral environment one's chances of survival and reproduction were highly correlated with those of the local population in general. This would imply that the world around you was the one that you operated in relative to.</p><br><p>In fact, there seems to have been reason for people to consider the world to be a single integrated unit when they thought about it. For example, from a Darwinian perspective, there was reason to think that the population level made evolutionary sense, for if individual humans failed to survive then there would be a lot of other humans there to replace them. This fact about modern life, which has been a fairly recent historical development, seems to have had very little impact on the way in which hunter-gather societies have conceptualized their interaction with the world around them. Thus, the very fact that people can contemplate that our ancestors were not in direct personal control of the world and thus that their decisions have a very real impact on the modern world seems to have had little impact on their behavior.</p><br><p>But as our ancestors evolved to live in larger and more complex societies this pattern of behavior would change. Why? Because in such societies the level of coordination needed for individual behavior in general became much higher than the level needed for individual survival and reproduction. Thus, while individual survival and reproduction was largely determined by things in the local population, cooperation became largely determined by the actions of the central political unit.</p>      </span>    </div>  </div></body></html>
